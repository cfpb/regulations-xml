	      <title>The broker rule and the meaning of “broker” and “investor.”</title>
	    <content>For the purposes of the guidance given in this commentary, an institution that takes and processes a loan <ref target="1003-2-Application" reftype="term">application</ref> and arranges for another institution to acquire the loan at or after closing is acting as a “broker,” and an institution that acquires a loan from a broker at or after closing is acting as an “investor.” (The terms used in this commentary may have different meanings in certain parts of the mortgage lending industry, and other terms may be used in place of these terms, for example in the Federal Housing Administration mortgage insurance programs.) Depending on the facts, a broker may or may not make a credit decision on an <ref target="1003-2-Application" reftype="term">application</ref> (and thus it may or may not have reporting responsibilities). If the broker makes a credit decision, it reports that decision; if it does not make a credit decision, it does not report. If an investor reviews an <ref target="1003-2-Application" reftype="term">application</ref> and makes a credit decision prior to closing, the investor reports that decision. If the investor does not review the <ref target="1003-2-Application" reftype="term">application</ref> prior to closing, it reports only the loans that it purchases; it does not report the loans it does not purchase. An institution that makes a credit decision on an <ref target="1003-2-Application" reftype="term">application</ref> prior to closing reports that decision regardless of whose name the loan closes in.</content></interpParagraph>

           	<title>Illustrations of the broker rule.</title>
            <content>Assume that, prior to closing, four investors receive the same <ref target="1003-2-Application" reftype="term">application</ref> from a broker; two deny it, one approves it, and one approves it and acquires the loan. In these circumstances, the first two report denials, the third reports the transaction as approved but not accepted, and the fourth reports an origination (whether the loan closes in the name of the broker or the investor). Alternatively, assume that the broker denies a loan before sending it to an investor; in this situation, the broker reports a denial.</content></interpParagraph>

            	<content>A prequalification request is a request by a prospective loan applicant (other than a request for preapproval) for a preliminary determination on whether the prospective applicant would likely qualify for credit under an institution's standards, or for a determination on the amount of credit for which the prospective applicant would likely qualify. Some institutions evaluate prequalification requests through a procedure that is separate from the institution's normal loan <ref target="1003-2-Application" reftype="term">application</ref> process; others use the same process. In either case, Regulation C does not require an institution to report prequalification requests on the HMDA/LAR, even though these requests may constitute <ref target="1003-2-Application" reftype="term">applications</ref> under Regulation B for purposes of adverse action notices.</content></interpParagraph>

In addition to conditions involving the identification of a suitable property and verification that no material change has occurred in the applicant's financial condition or creditworthiness, the written commitment may be subject only to other conditions (unrelated to the financial condition or creditworthiness of the applicant) that the lender ordinarily attaches to a traditional home mortgage <ref target="1003-2-Application" reftype="term">application</ref> approval. These conditions are limited to conditions such as requiring an acceptable title insurance binder or a certificate indicating clear termite inspection, and, in the case where the applicant plans to use the proceeds from the sale of the applicant's present home to purchase a new home, a settlement statement showing adequate proceeds from the sale of the present home.

              <title>Definition of a manufactured home.</title>
              <content>The definition in § <ref target="1003-2" reftype="internal">1003.2</ref> refers to the Federal building code for factory-built housing established by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The HUD code requires generally that housing be essentially ready for occupancy upon leaving the factory and being transported to a building site. Modular homes that meet all of the HUD code standards are included in the definition because they are ready for occupancy upon leaving the factory. Other factory-built homes, such as panelized and pre-cut homes, generally do not meet the HUD code because they require a significant amount of construction on site before they are ready for occupancy. Loans and <ref target="1003-2-Application" reftype="term">applications</ref> relating to <ref target="1003-2-ManufacturedHome" reftype="term">manufactured homes</ref> that do not meet the HUD code should not be identified as manufactured housing under HMDA.</content>

Other pricing terms include commonly used indices, margins, and initial fixed-rate periods for variable-rate transactions.

To obtain <ref target="1003-4-a-12-ii" reftype="term">average prime offer rates</ref>, the Bureau uses a survey of lenders that both meets the criteria of § <ref target="1003-4-a-12-ii" reftype="internal">1003.4(a)(12)(ii)</ref> and provides pricing terms for at least two types of variable-rate transactions and at least two types of non-variable-rate transactions.

                  <content>Lenders are required to report lien status for loans they originate and <ref target="1003-2-Application" reftype="term">applications</ref> that do not result in originations. Lien status is determined by reference to the best information readily available to the lender at the time final action is taken and to the lender's own procedures. Thus, lenders may rely on the title search they routinely perform as part of their underwriting procedures—for example, for <ref target="1003-2-HomePurchaseLoan" reftype="term">home purchase loans</ref>. Regulation C does not require lenders to perform title searches solely to comply with HMDA reporting requirements. Lenders may rely on other information that is readily available to them at the time final action is taken and that they reasonably believe is accurate, such as the applicant's statement on the <ref target="1003-2-Application" reftype="term">application</ref> or the applicant's credit report. For example, where the applicant indicates on the <ref target="1003-2-Application" reftype="term">application</ref> that there is a mortgage on the property or where the applicant's credit report shows that the applicant has a mortgage—and that mortgage is not going to be paid off as part of the transaction—the lender may assume that the loan it originates is secured by a subordinate lien. If the same <ref target="1003-2-Application" reftype="term">application</ref> did not result in an origination—for example, because the <ref target="1003-2-Application" reftype="term">application</ref> is denied or withdrawn—the lender would report the <ref target="1003-2-Application" reftype="term">application</ref> as an <ref target="1003-2-Application" reftype="term">application</ref> for a subordinate-lien loan.</content></interpParagraph>

For example, a consumer applies to a lender to refinance a $100,000 first mortgage; the consumer also has a <ref target="1003-2-HomeEquityLineOfCredit" reftype="term">home equity line of credit</ref> for $20,000. If the lender's practice in such a case is to ensure that it will have first-lien position—through a subordination agreement with the holder of the mortgage on the home equity line—then the lender should report the <ref target="1003-2-Application" reftype="term">application</ref> as an <ref target="1003-2-Application" reftype="term">application</ref> for a first-lien loan.</content></interpParagraph>
