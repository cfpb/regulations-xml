The disclosure described in § <ref target="1005-36-d-1" reftype="internal">1005.36(d)(1)</ref> may be provided as a separate disclosure, or on or with any other disclosure required by this subpart B related to the same series of <ref target="1005-30-d" reftype="term">preauthorized remittance transfers</ref>, provided that the disclosure and timing requirements in § <ref target="1005-36-d-2" reftype="internal">1005.36(d)(2)</ref> and other applicable provisions in subpart B are satisfied. For example, the required disclosures may be made on or with a receipt provided pursuant to § <ref target="1005-36-a-1-i" reftype="internal">1005.36(a)(1)(i)</ref>; a receipt provided pursuant to § <ref target="1005-36-a-2" reftype="internal">1005.36(a)(2)</ref>; or in a separate disclosure created by the <ref target="1005-30-f-1" reftype="term">provider</ref>.

      <title>30(f) Remittance Transfer Provider</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.30(e) incorporated the definition of “remittance transfer provider” from EFTA section 919(g)(3). Proposed § 205.30(e) stated that a remittance transfer provider (or provider) means any person that provides remittance transfers for a consumer in the normal course of its business, regardless of whether the consumer holds an account with such person. To eliminate redundancy, the proposed rule revised statutory references to “any person or financial institution” to “any person,” because the term “person” under Regulation E includes financial institutions. Proposed comment 30(e)-1 clarified that an agent is not deemed to be a remittance transfer provider by merely providing remittance transfer services on behalf of the remittance transfer provider. The proposed regulation is adopted generally as proposed in renumbered § 1005.30(f). Comment 30(f)-1 is revised for clarity to state that a person is not deemed to be acting as a remittance transfer provider when it performs activities as an agent on behalf of a remittance transfer provider. New comments 30(f)-2 and -3 are added as described below. The Bureau notes that this comment 30(f)-1 applies only for purposes of this rule. In other contexts, a person may act as a provider when it performs activities on behalf of a provider.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Normal Course of Business</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Board solicited comment on whether guidance should be adopted interpreting the phrase “normal course of business” based on the number of remittance transfers in a given year. Many industry commenters argued that the final rule should provide for a de minimis exception based on the number of remittance transfers sent in a given time period, although one credit union commenter stated that it could be difficult to track numbers. Suggestions ranged from 1,200 or fewer transfers annually to 2,400 transfers annually, per method (i.e., 2,400 wire transfers plus 2,400 international ACH transfers).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The commenters did not provide any data on the overall distribution and frequency of remittance transfers across various providers to support treating such high numbers of transactions as being outside the normal course of business. Nor did they suggest other means of determining when remittance transfer providers are engaging in transfers merely as an accommodation to occasional consumer requests rather than part of a business of payment services. Absent significant additional information, the Bureau is skeptical that Congress intended to exclude companies averaging 100 or more remittance transfer providers per month from the statutory scheme. Based on the data presented by commenters, such a range would appear to exclude the majority of providers of open network transfers, such as international wire transfers and ACH transactions, from the rule. For example, one trade association commenter stated that most respondents to an information request said that they make fewer than 2,400 international transactions per year. As discussed above, the Bureau believes that the statute clearly covers open network transfers, such as wire transfers and ACH transactions. Providing an exception based on the ranges suggested by these commenters would allow many financial institutions that arguably regularly and in the normal course of business provide remittance transfers to not be subject to the regulation. The Bureau believes in general that the term “normal course of business” covers remittance transfer activities at a level significantly lower than the ranges suggested by these commenters.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In other contexts, regulatory coverage is triggered by a relatively small number of transactions. For example, under Regulation Z, 12 CFR part 1026, a creditor is a person who regularly extends consumer credit under specified circumstances. A person regularly extends consumer credit when it extends consumer credit more than 25 times in the preceding calendar year or in the current year (and five times for transactions secured by a dwelling, or even one time for certain high-cost mortgages).<footnote ref="73">The Bureau notes that it has issued a separate notice of request for information in which the Bureau requests comment on whether it should revise these threshold numbers in Regulation Z. See 76 FR 75825 (Dec. 5, 2011).</footnote> See 12 CFR 1026.2(a)(17). Under State law, a single money transmission may trigger a requirement to register as a money transmitter.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe it has sufficient information on the frequency with which entities engage in remittance transfers to set a specific numerical threshold based on the current administrative record. Accordingly, the final rule adopts a new comment 30(f)-2 addressing “normal course of business.” Comment 30(f)-2 states that whether a person provides remittance transfers in the normal course of business depends on the facts and circumstances, including the total number and frequency of remittance transfers sent by the provider. For example, if a financial institution generally does not make international consumer wire transfers available to customers, but sends a couple of international consumer wire transfers in a given year as an accommodation for a customer, the institution does not provide remittance transfers in the normal course of business. In contrast, if a financial institution makes international consumer wire transfers generally available to customers (whether described in the institution's deposit account agreement, or in practice) and makes transfers multiple times per month, the institution provides remittance transfers in the normal course of business.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>While the final comment does not include a numerical threshold for “normal course of business,” the Bureau recognizes that a bright-line number may ease compliance. Thus, in the January 2012 Proposed Rule, published elsewhere in the Federal Register today, the Bureau is soliciting further comment on a potential safe harbor threshold.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Multiple Remittance Transfer Providers</title>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 30(f)-3 provides guidance where more than one remittance transfer provider is involved in providing a remittance transfer. The Bureau recognizes that in some situations more than one remittance transfer provider may be involved in providing a remittance transfer. For example, prepaid card programs may involve, among others: (i) A program sponsor that establishes the program relationships, identifies and procures the necessary parties and sets contractual terms and conditions; (ii) a program manager which functions as a day-to-day operations “control center” for the program; and (iii) an issuing bank whose contractual involvement is required to invoke the payment network and which also may serve as the holder of funds that have been prepaid and are awaiting instructions to be disbursed. Any and all of these entities may be a “remittance transfer provider” if they meet the definition as set forth in § 1005.30(f).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 30(f)-3 provides that if the remittance transfer involves more than one remittance transfer provider, only one set of disclosures must be given, and the remittance transfer providers must agree among themselves which provider must take the actions necessary to comply with the requirements that subpart B imposes on any or all of them. Even though the providers must designate one provider to take the actions necessary to comply with the requirements that subpart B imposes on any or all of them, all remittance transfer providers involved in the remittance transfer remain responsible for compliance with the applicable provisions of the EFTA and Regulation E.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1005.31 Disclosures</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Overview</title>
        <analysisParagraph>In the February Proposal, the Bureau solicited comment on issues relating to disclosure of the cancellation requirements in § 1005.36(c) for remittance transfers scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer. To address these issues, the Bureau is amending the disclosure requirements in §§ 1005.31(a)(3), (a)(5), and (b)(2) to improve consumers' ability to determine the cancellation deadlines for particular transfers. In addition, the Bureau is amending § 1005.31(b)(3), regarding combined disclosures, to allow providers to give a confirmation that the transfer has been scheduled in lieu of the proof of payment required for transfers scheduled before payment is processed for the transfer. These amendments are discussed in detail in their respective sections below.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Disclosure of Deadline To Cancel Transfers Scheduled Before the Date of Transfer</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail below regarding § 1005.36(c), the February Final Rule adopts a cancellation policy for remittance transfers. Under § 1005.34(a) of the February Final Rule, a sender generally has 30 minutes after payment is made to cancel a remittance transfer. The February Final Rule, however, contains special cancellation procedures for any remittance transfer that is scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, including a series of preauthorized remittance transfers. For these transfers, the provider is required to cancel the remittance transfer if it receives a request to cancel from the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The February Proposal solicited comment on possible changes to the cancellation requirements for remittance transfers that are scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, including preauthorized remittance transfers. Specifically, the February Proposal solicited comment on whether the three-business-day period for cancelling such remittance transfers adopted in the February Final Rule is appropriate, or whether the rule should require a deadline to cancel these transfer that is more or less than three business days. The February Proposal also solicited comment on three issues related to the disclosure of the deadline to cancel as set forth in the February Final Rule. The first issue was whether the three-business-day deadline to cancel transfers scheduled before the date of the transfer should be disclosed differently to senders, such as by requiring a remittance transfer provider to disclose in the receipt the specific date on which the right to cancel will expire. The second issue was whether a provider should be allowed to describe both the three-business-day and 30-minute cancellation provisions on a single receipt and either describe the transfers to which each cancellation period is applicable, or alternatively, use a checkbox or other method to designate which cancellation period is applicable to the transfer to which the receipt relates. The third issue was whether the cancellation requirements should be disclosed in the pre-payment disclosure, rather than in the receipt, for each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The approaches taken in the final rule for the three-business-day cancellation period and the disclosures required to be provided in connection with subsequent remittance transfers within a series of preauthorized remittance transfers are described in greater detail below in the discussion regarding § 1005.36(c) and (d). Consistent with these provisions, the Bureau is also revising § 1005.31 to add new paragraphs (a)(3)(iv), (a)(5)(iv), and (b)(2)(vii), and associated commentary, regarding the content and format of the disclosures that must be provided to senders of transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer and of certain preauthorized remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Taken together, the final rule requires remittance transfer providers to disclose the date of transfer, and in certain instances, the future date or dates of transfer and related information in receipts that may be provided at the time payment is made or after the date of transfer. For any remittance transfer scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, the receipt provided when payment is made must disclose the date of transfer for that transfer. Where a consumer schedules a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the receipt provided for the first transfer must also provide the date of transfer for that first transfer. In each case, if a second receipt is required after the date of transfer, that receipt must also disclose the date the transfer was made. The final rule also addresses, among other things, a requirement to disclose future dates of transfer for subsequent preauthorized transfers. In addition to the information described above, the receipt provided for the initial transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers must also disclose the future date or dates of transfer for any subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer in that series for which the date of transfer is scheduled four or fewer business days after the date on which payment for the initial transfer is made. For other subsequent preauthorized transfers, the rule provides flexibility as to whether the information regarding transfer dates and cancellation requirements for subsequent transfers is included in one or more receipts or standalone disclosures, so long as it is provided sufficiently in advance to allow the consumer to exercise his or her cancellation rights.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, as is the case with one-time transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, the final rule also requires that receipts for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers include the date of transfer for the transfer that is the subject of the receipt and, if the provider chooses, the future dates of transfer for the next scheduled subsequent transfer or transfers.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>31(a) General Form of Disclosures</title>

        <analysisSection>
  <title>31(a)(3)(iv)</title>
  <analysisParagraph>As discussed below, the Bureau adds new § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii) to require that in certain circumstances, a receipt for a remittance transfer include the date of the transfer for that specific transfer in order to provide consumers with a clearer explanation of their cancellation rights. Further, the Bureau adds new § 1005.36(d) to require that in certain instances, such receipts disclose the dates of upcoming transfers and related information. The Bureau is making corresponding changes to the disclosure requirements for transfers conducted entirely by telephone to require oral disclosure of transfer date information in certain circumstances. As stated in the February Final Rule, the Bureau believes that for oral telephone transactions, senders should be informed of their cancellation rights before the cancellation period has passed. 77 FR 6194, 6217. Because a receipt would generally be mailed to a sender for telephone transactions as permitted by § 1005.31(e)(2), the sender may not receive the cancellation disclosure included in that receipt until after the standard 30-minute cancellation period had passed unless the Bureau required the disclosure to be made orally before the 30-minute cancellation period expires. Consequently, § 1005.31(a)(3)(iii), as adopted in the February Final Rule, requires oral disclosure of cancellation rights when the sender requests the remittance transfer and prior to payment for the transfer, if the provider takes advantage of the option to provide pre-payment disclosures orally for transactions conducted entirely by telephone.</analysisParagraph>
  <analysisParagraph>For similar reasons, among others, the Bureau believes that for a remittance transfer scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, and for any preauthorized remittance transfer scheduled to occur four or fewer business days after the date payment is made for the transfer, an oral pre-payment disclosure regarding cancellation rights should be accompanied by an oral disclosure regarding the date of that transfer. Although the time period for cancellation of transfers scheduled in advance may be calculated in days rather than minutes, the period may still expire before the consumer receives any written material, particularly if the consumer is scheduling the transfer three or four days in advance. For preauthorized remittance transfers, several transfers in the series may be sent before a written receipt is received.</analysisParagraph>
  <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, pursuant to its authority under EFTA section 919(a)(5)(A), the Bureau is amending § 1005.31(a)(3) to add § 1005.31(a)(3)(iv) as a further condition for the provision of oral disclosures for remittance transfers conducted entirely by telephone. This provision permits oral disclosures if (among other requirements) the provider discloses orally, to the extent applicable, (A) the information required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii) and (B) the information required by § 1005.36(d)(1)(i)(A) with respect to transfers subject to § 1005.36(d)(2)(ii), pursuant to the timing requirements in § 1005.31(e)(1).</analysisParagraph>
        </analysisSection>
        <analysisSection>
  <title>31(a)(5)(iv)</title>
  <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis to the February Final Rule, since remittance transfers sent via mobile application or text message on a telephone are conducted entirely by telephone, EFTA section 919(a)(5)(A) permits the Bureau to allow oral pre-payment disclosures in connection with transfers sent via mobile application or text message if the transfer is conducted entirely by telephone. 77 FR 6194, 6217. Because oral disclosures are not retainable, the Bureau further observed that for such transactions, senders would not be less protected, and might be better informed, by receiving pre-payment disclosures via mobile application or a text message even though these disclosures may also not be retainable. Id. Accordingly, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and facilitate compliance, the Bureau used its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to include in the February Final Rule § 1005.31(a)(5), which states that the pre-payment disclosure may be provided orally or via mobile application or text message if: (i) The transaction is conducted entirely by telephone via mobile application or text message; (ii) the remittance transfer provider complies with the foreign language requirements of § 1005.31(g)(2); and (iii) the provider discloses orally or via mobile application or text message a statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) pursuant to the timing requirements in § 1005.31(e)(1).</analysisParagraph>
  <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to the same authority, and for the same reasons as those discussed above regarding with § 1005.31(a)(3)(iv), the Bureau adopts new § 1005.31(a)(5)(iv), which adds as an additional condition for the provision of the pre-payment disclosures orally or via mobile application or text message a requirement that the provider disclose, to the extent applicable, (A) the information required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii) and (B) the information required by § 1005.36(d)(1)(i)(A) with respect to transfers subject to § 1005.36(d)(2)(ii), pursuant to the timing requirements in § 1005.31(e)(1).</analysisParagraph>

        <title>31(b)(2) Receipt</title>

        <analysisSection>
  <title>31(b)(2)(vii) Date of Transfer</title>
  <analysisParagraph>The February Final Rule requires the receipt provided to a sender to include an abbreviated statement about the sender's cancellation rights. § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv). In the February Proposal, the Bureau noted that senders may have difficulty determining the specific date on which the right to cancel expires for a particular transfer. 77 FR 6310, 6321. Accordingly, the Bureau sought comment on whether, as applicable, the three-business-day deadline to cancel transfers should be disclosed differently to consumers, such as by requiring a remittance transfer provider to disclose in the receipt the specific date on which the right to cancel will expire or to state its business days in receipts provided to senders. The Bureau also solicited comment on alternative means of disclosing the deadline for cancelling transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received a number of comments on the cancellation disclosure from various industry members and one consumer group. Most comments focused on whether providers should be required to include the specific cancellation deadline in the receipts provided to senders. Commenters did not address any of the other questions raised on this issue in the February Proposal nor did they suggest alternatives.<footnote ref="11">Regarding the Bureau's inquiry about disclosure of the provider's business days, the Bureau did not receive comment on this issue specifically, although one industry commenter stated that providers should not be required to disclose the specific deadline to cancel or other additional items that are not required to be disclosed by the February Final Rule.</footnote>

  </analysisParagraph>
  <analysisParagraph>With respect to disclosure of the specific cancellation date, the majority of industry commenters opposed such a requirement. Some industry commenters asserted that requiring disclosure of the specific cancellation deadline for a particular transaction would make it more difficult and expensive to produce receipts by adding a new element specific to each transfer. One industry commenter stated that requiring a remittance transfer provider to specify the exact date for cancellation would create significant technical challenges because at that point, the disclosure becomes dynamic, rather than static. This commenter stated that producing such a dynamic disclosure may require updating based on the time of day of the transfer request and the provider's processing deadline, whereas a static disclosure without such a requirement can be reliably produced at any time of day. Further, the commenter stated that a sender uncertain of the cancellation deadline will contact a remittance transfer provider directly for clarification and then cancel the transaction in the course of the same contact.</analysisParagraph>
  <analysisParagraph>In contrast, the consumer group commenter argued that the period for cancellation rights should be disclosed as a specific date. One industry commenter did not oppose requiring remittance transfer providers to disclose the specific cancellation date for each transaction, but argued that providers should be allowed to disclose a cut-off time for exercising the cancellation right because the lack of clarity regarding the time of day the cancellation period expires could result in a transfer being delayed until the next business day.</analysisParagraph>
  <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to the Bureau's authority under EFTA section 919(d)(3), the February Final Rule is revised to add a new § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii), which requires that a receipt for any remittance transfer scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, or the first transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, disclose the date the remittance transfer provider will make or made the remittance transfer, using the term “Transfer Date,” or a substantially similar term.</analysisParagraph>
  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adopting commentary to provide further guidance on the application of § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii). As explained in more detail below in the discussion of § 1005.36, for certain transactions, a receipt meeting the requirements of § 1005.31(b)(2), including the transfer date required under § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii), may need to be provided at different times. For example, for the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, an initial receipt will need to be provided at the time payment is made for the transfer; and then in some cases, a receipt will need to be provided shortly after that particular transfer has been made. Thus, comment 31(b)(2)-4 clarifies that, where applicable, § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii) requires disclosure of the date of transfer for the remittance transfer that is the subject of a receipt required by § 1005.31(b)(2), including a receipt that is provided in accordance with the timing requirements in § 1005.36(a).</analysisParagraph>
  <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(2)-4 further clarifies that, for any subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer subject to § 1005.36(d)(2)(ii), the future date of transfer and related information must be provided on any receipt provided for the initial transfer in that series of preauthorized remittance transfers, or where permitted, or disclosed as permitted by § 1005.31(a)(3) and (a)(5), in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(1)(i).</analysisParagraph>
  <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(2)-5 provides an example of how disclosure of the dates of transfer required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii) and § 1005.36(d)(1) should be provided in receipts required by § 1005.31(b)(2) pursuant to the timing requirements in § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(1)(ii). Comment 31(b)(2)-5 also explains that if the provider discloses on either receipt the cancellation period applicable to and dates of subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers in accordance with 1005.36(d)(2)(i), the disclosure must be phrased and formatted in such a way that it is clear to the sender which cancellation period is applicable each date of transfer on the receipt.</analysisParagraph>
  <analysisParagraph>Upon further review and analysis, the Bureau concludes that because the cancellation requirements in § 1005.36(c) are based on and calculated from the date of transfer, the actual transfer date is the most logical piece of information to require since the remittance transfer provider is already required to obtain this information in order to comply with § 1005.36(c), although it is not required to be disclosed to the sender under the February Final Rule.</analysisParagraph>
  <analysisParagraph>Further, the Bureau also believes that requiring a remittance transfer provider to disclose the date of a remittance transfer, along with a disclosure that the sender's cancellation rights will expire three business days before the date of the transfer, provides a reasonable balance between consumer and industry interests. This approach significantly improves the information provided to senders because, under the February Final Rule, a provider is generally only required to disclose the cancellation policy, with a statement such as “you can cancel for a full refund no later than three business days prior to the scheduled date of the transfer.” 77 FR 6310, 6321. This required disclosure, however, does not elaborate on what constitutes the date of transfer or how the sender may determine the cancellation deadline from the date of transfer. Without a clear starting point from which to count the three-business-day deadline, the Bureau believes senders may be confused about the dates by which they are required to cancel transfers, which may make cancellation disclosures less effective. In situations such as when transferred funds will be drawn from an account at a later date rather than paid up front, the transfer date may also help the sender understand when the funds for the transfer must be available for the provider to conduct the transfer. The transfer date may also help senders differentiate and keep track of completed transfers, especially where the sender receives a number of receipts in the mail or on an account statement in close proximity to one another.</analysisParagraph>
  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also believes that requiring disclosure of the date of transfer is the most technically feasible solution relative to the alternatives raised in the February Proposal. The dates of transfer should be readily available to remittance transfer providers since they are likely primarily responsible for executing remittance transfer requests, and as part of their business processes should already know when they must execute transfers to satisfy the terms of their contracts with senders (if the contracts are based on the date of the transfer) or to meet any delivery deadlines (if those deadlines are the bases of the contracts). The Bureau also believes that disclosure of the date of transfer is an added benefit for senders who may choose to schedule a transaction based on when the funds must be available. Finally, the Bureau notes that the requirement to disclose the date of transfer is consistent with the existing requirement for certain preauthorized electronic fund transfers. In particular, § 1005.10(d)(1) (in subpart A of Regulation E) requires an electronic fund transfer provider to send the consumer the date of transfer (and other information) at least ten days before the scheduled date of the transfer when a preauthorized electronic fund transfer from the consumer's account will vary in amount from the previous transfer under the same authorization. Consequently, certain remittance transfer providers that also provide preauthorized electronic fund transfers may already have the capability to produce disclosures with the date of transfer.</analysisParagraph>
  <analysisParagraph>Moreover, the Bureau believes that keeping disclosure forms short, simple, and succinct is helpful to senders. As noted in the February Final Rule, participants in consumer testing understood and responded positively to concise, abbreviated disclosures. 77 FR 6194, 6228. Of the options considered, the Bureau believes that disclosure of only the date of transfer best accomplishes this goal because that date may be provided independently of other information. While disclosure of the specific dates of cancellation deadlines would inform senders of the actual dates on which their rights to cancel expire, the Bureau believes that consumers would still benefit from disclosure of the date of transfer. The Bureau is concerned that requiring providers to include multiple dates on receipts may be more confusing to senders and possibly dilute the usefulness of the disclosures regarding cancellation rights.</analysisParagraph>
  <analysisParagraph>Likewise, the Bureau is concerned that requiring providers to state their business days on receipts may result in a longer, more unwieldy form. The Bureau believes that providers will generally make available to the public upon request the days that constitute “business days” under subpart B of Regulation E, and that, therefore, senders can obtain this information as necessary. Absent further data regarding the usefulness of this information, the Bureau does not believe that it is appropriate at this time to make the forms significantly longer and more complicated to include information that is likely to be used by only a small subset of consumers who may contact their remittance transfer providers in any event to effectuate the cancellation.</analysisParagraph>
  <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, the Bureau believes that requiring the date of transfer and cancellation rights in receipts strikes the appropriate balance between providing senders with information about their transfers and minimizing the burden to providers. However, the Bureau will continue to gather data on consumers' exercise of cancellation rights, the effectiveness of related disclosures, and programming burdens on providers over time and, if warranted, will reexamine this issue at a later date to determine if a better solution exists.</analysisParagraph>
  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has further determined that it is appropriate to require disclosure of the date of transfer at the time payment is made, but also in subsequent receipts required to be provided with respect to a given transfer in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) or § 1005.36(a)(2)(ii). The Bureau believes that a single consistent rule will be simpler as a matter of programming for providers and will frequently provide additional benefits to consumers in light of the fact that the final rule eliminates the requirement to provide the pre-payment disclosure and receipt in advance of the transfer for subsequent preauthorized transfers in a series. (See discussion below regarding § 1005.36(a).)</analysisParagraph>
  <analysisParagraph>In particular, although stating the date of transfer in a post-transfer receipt will not facilitate senders' understanding of cancellation deadlines that have already passed, the Bureau believes the information will frequently be useful to senders in other ways. For example, as noted above, if a sender schedules a number of standalone transfers before the date of transfer, or a series of closely-spaced preauthorized remittance transfers, senders may receive a number of receipts in close proximity to each other and may use the date of transfer to identify and track which transfer has occurred. Having the date of transfer on receipts with respect to each transfer would likewise be helpful in situations where the receipt is provided with a periodic statement on which there are several transactions.</analysisParagraph>
  <analysisParagraph>In addition, because senders may not receive additional disclosures prior to the subsequent preauthorized transfer in a series, the receipt provided after the transfer is completed in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(2)(ii) will contain information regarding cancellation rights (as well as the exchange rate, fees and taxes) that could help inform the sender about the upcoming subsequent remittance transfer. Furthermore, as most preauthorized remittance transfers are likely to be scheduled some time in advance, senders will generally receive receipts after the transfer is completed. This receipt would provide confirmation that the transfer occurred as scheduled. Finally, where remittance transfer providers choose to satisfy their obligations under § 1005.36(d)(1) by disclosing the future transfer dates for preauthorized transfers on a receipt relating to a prior transaction, providing the date of transfer for the prior transaction will help differentiate to which transfer the disclosures in the receipt apply.</analysisParagraph>
  <analysisSection>
            <title>Disclosure of Both the Three-Business-Day Deadline and the 30-Minute Deadline in Same Receipt</title>
            <analysisParagraph>Under § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) of the February Final Rule, notice of the period to cancel a remittance transfer must be disclosed in the receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(2). For any transfer scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, the receipt provided by the remittance transfer provider to the sender may describe only the cancellation rights and three-business-day deadline set forth in § 1005.36(c). For all other remittance transfers, the provider is required to describe the cancellation rights and 30-minute cancellation period set forth in § 1005.34(a). In the February Proposal, the Bureau solicited comment on whether remittance transfer providers that offer both types of transfers should be given flexibility to include the two different cancellation periods permitted by this rule on the same receipt with some statement or method such as a checkbox to designate which cancellation period applies to a given transaction.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received only a few comments on this issue. Of those received, two industry commenters urged the Bureau to permit providers flexibility in disclosing the cancellation requirement. One industry commenter argued that allowing providers to include both cancellation period options on the same receipt would enable providers to rely on one standard receipt form, which, compared to the alternative, may result in lower costs for providers (and, presumably, lower prices for senders). The other industry commenter stated that it supported any disclosure modification that would allow smaller providers to generate and deliver one disclosure and that the proposed option would eliminate the need to produce multiple disclosures to reflect the different cancellation periods. A consumer group commenter, however, stated that, to ensure that senders receive accurate and precise information to avoid potential confusion, only the cancellation provision that corresponds to the type of remittance transfer requested should be disclosed.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>After consideration of these comments, the Bureau is adding new comment 31(b)(2)-6 to clarify that providers that offer remittance transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, as well as remittance transfers scheduled fewer than three business days before the date of the transfer, may meet the cancellation disclosure requirements in § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) by describing the three-business-day and 30-minute cancellation periods on the same disclosure and using a checkbox or other method to clearly designate the applicable cancellation period. In other words, remittance transfer providers that provide both transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer and transfers scheduled closer to the date of the transfer may disclose the cancellation period applicable to a particular transfer in one of two ways: (i) describe in the receipt either the 30-minute cancellation period or the three-business-day cancellation period, as applicable to the particular transaction; or (ii) provide a description of both the 30-minute and three-business-day cancellation periods along with a clear indication of which cancellation period applies to the sender's transaction. With respect to the latter option, the comment does not mandate a particular method for identifying the applicable time period for cancellation. The comment, however, clarifies that the provider may use a number of ways to indicate which cancellation period applies to the transaction including, but not limited to, a statement to that effect, use of a checkbox, highlighting, circling, and the like. Finally, comment 31(b)(2)-6 states that for transfers scheduled three or more business days before the date of transfer, the cancellation disclosures provided pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) should be phrased and formatted in such a way that it is clear to the sender which cancellation period is applicable to the date of transfer disclosed on the receipt.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes senders are unlikely to be confused by having a description of both cancellation deadlines in the same disclosure. To the contrary, including a description of both the 30-minute and three-business-day cancellation period with a checkbox or other method that clearly designates the cancellation time period applicable to the sender's transaction may improve senders' understanding of the cancellation provisions generally. Moreover, the ability for remittance transfer providers to use pre-printed receipt forms that describe both cancellation options with some method to identify the applicable cancellation time period may reduce the need to create multiple standard receipts, potentially reducing costs for some providers. The Bureau also notes that nothing in the final rule prohibits a provider from including only the applicable cancellation policy on a receipt.</analysisParagraph>

        <analysisSection>
  <title>31(b)(3) Combined Disclosure</title>
  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is revising the requirements in the February Final Rule for combined disclosures that remittance transfer providers may choose to give to senders. Under § 1005.31(b)(3) in the February Final Rule, a remittance transfer provider may combine the pre-payment disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(1) and the receipt required by § 1005.31(b)(2) into a single, combined disclosure, if such a disclosure is provided pursuant to the timing requirements applicable to pre-payment disclosures. See § 1005.31(e)(1). Section 1005.31(b)(3) provides that if the provider chooses to provide a combined disclosure, the provider must also provide the sender a proof of payment for the transfer when payment is made for the remittance transfer. As described in the February Final Rule, the Bureau issued § 1005.31(b)(3) pursuant to its authority under EFTA sections 919(a)(5)(C), and 904(a) and (c).</analysisParagraph>
  <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to the same authority, the Bureau is revising § 1005.31(b)(3) to allow a remittance transfer provider to provide a confirmation of scheduling in lieu of the proof of payment with combined disclosures for transfers scheduled before the date of transfer in order to facilitate compliance and enhance consumer protection. The Bureau is redesignating § 1005.31(b)(3) from the February Final Rule as § 1005.31(b)(3)(i) and is adopting a new § 1005.31(b)(3)(ii). Section 1005.31(b)(3)(ii) states that if the disclosure described in § 1005.31(b)(3)(i) is provided in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) (which concerns one-time transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer or the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers) and payment is not processed by the remittance transfer provider at the time the remittance transfer is scheduled, a remittance transfer provider may provide confirmation that the transaction has been scheduled in lieu of the proof of payment otherwise required by § 1005.31(b)(3)(i). The confirmation of scheduling must be clear and conspicuous, provided in writing or electronically, and provided in a retainable form.</analysisParagraph>
  <analysisParagraph>Although the February Proposal did not propose changes to § 1005.31(b)(3), it sought comment generally on the form of disclosures for transfers scheduled before the date of transfer. 77 FR 6310, 6317. The Bureau believes that adjustments are necessary to § 1005.31(b)(3) because while comment 31(e)-2 in the final rule states that payment is made for purposes of subpart B of Regulation E when payment is authorized, this does not necessarily mean that providing “proof of payment” at the time of authorization will make sense for either the provider or the sender for a one-time remittance transfer that is scheduled before the date of transfer or the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers when payment may not be processed until closer to the date of such transfer.</analysisParagraph>
  <analysisParagraph>For many remittance transfers, senders tender payment for immediate processing once they authorize the remittance transfer provider to complete the transfer (e.g., by paying cash or by providing a payment device). In those situations, the Bureau does not believe there would be any downside for the sender or the remittance transfer provider if the provider provided proof of payment at the time that payment is made, i.e., authorized. These situations are distinct from the case in which a sender arranges with the provider to have funds deducted from the sender's account with the provider or to process a payment with a payment device at some later time, closer to the date of a transfer. In such an instance, the Bureau is concerned that providing a sender with “proof of payment” could confuse the sender. Furthermore, the Bureau is concerned that providers may not wish to provide “proof of payment” in such instances.</analysisParagraph>
  <analysisParagraph>New comment 31(b)(3)-2 provides additional guidance regarding the confirmation of scheduling. This comment explains that, as discussed in comment 31(e)-2, payment is considered to be made when payment is authorized for purposes of various timing requirements in subpart B, including with regard to the timing requirement for provision of the proof of payment described in § 1005.31(b)(3)(i). However, where a transfer (whether a one-time remittance transfer or the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers) is scheduled before the date of transfer and the provider does not intend to process payment until at or near the date of transfer, the provider may provide a confirmation of scheduling in lieu of the proof of payment required by § 1005.31(b)(3)(i). No further proof of payment is required when payment is later processed.</analysisParagraph>

<analysisParagraph>In the February Proposal, the Bureau proposed renumbering § 1005.32(b) to § 1005.32(b)(1) to allow for the proposed exception for the disclosure of estimates for transfers scheduled before the date of transfer (i.e., proposed § 1005.32(b)(2)). The February Proposal also proposed conforming changes to provisions that reference this exception. No comments were received on this renumbering.

<title>32(B)(2) Permanent Exception for Transfers Scheduled Before the Date of Transfers</title>
<analysisParagraph>In the February Proposal, the Bureau proposed to use its EFTA section 904(a) and (c) authority to add a new exception, in proposed § 1005.32(b)(2), that would provide additional flexibility for remittance transfer providers to disclose estimates in pre-payment disclosures and receipts for one-time transfers or the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers scheduled to occur more than ten days after the transfer is authorized.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>In the February Proposal, the Bureau noted that the market for remittance transfers scheduled in advance of the date of transfer, including preauthorized remittance transfers, is still in its nascent stages. The Bureau also noted its concern that requiring a remittance transfer provider to set exchange rates before the date of transfer might cause a provider that is already permitting consumers to schedule remittance transfers in advance of the date of transfer to stop offering a potentially useful product to consumers rather than bear or manage the increased exchange rate risk that might be associated with such a product. While remittance transfer providers (or their business partners) may be able to develop tools to manage such risk, the Bureau stated that it was concerned that providers might not do so, or that they would pass on any new risk management costs to consumers. Based on these concerns, the Bureau sought comment on whether providers should be permitted to disclose estimates of exchange rates, and related figures, in two circumstances: (i) A sender schedules a one-time transfer or the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers to occur more than ten days after the transfer is authorized; or (ii) a sender enters into an agreement for preauthorized remittance transfers where the amount of the transfers can vary and the provider does not know the exact amount of the first transfer at the time the disclosures for that transfer are given. The Bureau received comments about the use of estimates generally and conducted additional outreach to better understand some of the issues raised by commenters.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting new § 1005.32(b)(2), which permits disclosures to contain estimates in certain cases for remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer. The new provision allows for certain estimates for all remittance transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer, rather than only for one-time transfers or the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers scheduled more than ten business days before the date of the transfer (as was proposed). The allowance for estimates in disclosures for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers will have limited application, insofar as the Bureau is eliminating the requirement that pre-payment disclosures be sent prior to subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers and is only requiring pre-transfer receipts for such transfers when certain previously disclosed figures change. However, to the extent that a remittance transfer provider must send a pre-transfer receipt, the final rule permits the provider to disclose estimates in accordance with § 1005.32(b)(2). See § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) (discussing pre-transfer disclosure requirements for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers). In addition, the new exception permitting estimates is expanded from the February Proposal to allow estimates in certain cases when the provider agrees to a sender's request to fix the amount to be transferred in the currency in which the remittance transfer will be received and not the currency in which it is funded. The new provisions and comments received are discussed in more detail below.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection notice="2012-19702" date="2013-10-28">
<title>Provision of Estimates for Transfers Scheduled Before the Date of Transfer</title>
<analysisParagraph>Industry commenters generally supported the first option for estimates suggested by the February Proposal: an exception from the general rule requiring accurate disclosures (§ 1005.31(f)) that would permit remittance transfer providers to disclose estimates of the amount of currency to be received, as well as other information such as exchange rates, for certain remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer. Although the February Proposal only sought comment regarding disclosure of estimates in one-time transfers and the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers scheduled more than ten business days before the date of transfer, most commenters addressed the use of estimates for all transfers scheduled before the date of transfer (i.e., one-time transfers scheduled before the date of transfer, the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, and subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers).</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Industry commenters stated that absent an exception allowing for the disclosure of estimates, remittance transfer providers would face difficulties adjusting their risk management systems to provide accurate exchange rates before the date of transfer, particularly when providers are required to allow senders to cancel remittance transfers up to three business days before the scheduled date of transfer. See § 1005.36(c). Commenters also favored the disclosure of estimates due to the potential legal consequences associated with creating risk management strategies required in order to provide accurate (rather than estimated) disclosures far before a scheduled remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>First, multiple industry commenters argued that if remittance transfer providers were required to give accurate disclosures of the exchange rates that would apply to remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer, any providers offering such transfers would likely need to change their current methods of managing foreign exchange risk. One commenter stated that remittance transfer providers often assume the risk from fluctuations in the wholesale rates at which they buy foreign currency during the course of a day, by setting one retail exchange rate to apply to remittance transfers (or other transactions) conducted throughout that day. However, industry commenters stated that setting retail exchange rates farther before the date of transfer would cause a remittance transfer provider to incur more exchange rate risk due to the extended time period during which wholesale foreign currency markets might fluctuate. Commenters contended that in order to disclose the exchange rate that would apply to a remittance transfer far before the date of such transfer, a provider would either have to (1) bear the risk of the wholesale exchange rate changing before the date of transfer or (2) use some method to purchase currency before the date of transfer and bear the risk of the sender cancelling the transfer, leaving the provider (or its business partner) with unneeded currency.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>During outreach conversations, the Bureau spoke to industry participants to learn more about how remittance transfer providers can or do manage foreign exchange risk. In these conversations, foreign currency providers and other market participants stated that if they were required to disclose accurate exchange rates several days in advance of the date of transfer, remittance transfer providers (or their business partners) might have to develop new procedures to manage fluctuations in the wholesale foreign exchange rates, i.e., the rates at which remittance transfer providers (or their business partners) generally buy foreign currency.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Second, several industry commenters stated that remittance transfer providers would face difficulties implementing any of the methods that would allow them to manage the risk associated with disclosing exchange rates before the date of a transfer, and that these methods could result in increased prices for senders. Industry commenters indicated, and participants in outreach conducted by the Bureau further explained, that the primary method for remittance transfer providers (or their business partners) to manage any additional risk created due to the disclosure of actual exchange rates for remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer would likely be through employing foreign exchange futures or forward contracts, through which a buyer commits to buying a specified amount of foreign currency, at a specified foreign exchange rate, at a later date.<footnote ref="12">A futures contract for foreign currency is a contract between two parties to purchase a specified amount of foreign currency at a date in the future for a price agreed upon at the time of contracting. Such contracts would allow a provider to “lock-in” a rate in order for it to give customers an accurate rate when scheduling the transfer.</footnote> Industry commenters stated that a remittance transfer provider could itself, or through a third party, purchase a futures or a forward contract for the amount of the remittance transfer, and/or sell such a contract to the sender. One industry commenter explained, however, that such methods can be risky if foreign currency markets fluctuate and if a sender cancels a remittance transfer after the provider secures the currency needed for the transfer. In such a case, a remittance transfer provider (or its business partner) may experience a loss due to changes in the foreign exchange markets.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Third, industry commenters stated that setting exchange rates before the date of transfer could implicate other laws and regulations. For example, one trade association commenter expressed concern that for some types of entities, simply setting an exchange rate before the date of transfer might be considered a forward contract, and that therefore these entities might become subject to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulations that contain registration, capital, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements. Separately, in an outreach conversation, one bank expressed concern that restrictions on depository institutions' investments created by the Dodd-Frank Act may similarly limit depository institutions' ability to purchase the necessary contracts needed to manage the risk associated with setting far in advance the exchange rates that will apply to remittance transfers. Finally, one credit union commenter expressed concern that Federal credit union regulations might restrict credit unions' ability to manage foreign currency risk.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Fourth, apart from regulatory concerns, some industry commenters and participants in outreach suggested that requiring accurate disclosures of exchange rates far before the date of transfer would significantly increase costs. Several commenters stated that any additional efforts to provide exact exchange rates in advance would result in increased prices charged to senders (though none estimated by how much). These commenters indicated that costs could be so high that senders would not choose these products.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Fifth, an industry commenter expressed concern that any requirement to disclose an accurate exchange rate before the date of a remittance transfer would pose a significant risk to remittance transfer providers if senders decide to take advantage of the three-business-day cancellation period to seek better exchange rates. The requirements in the February Final Rule in §§ 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), 1005.33(a)(1)(iii), and 1005.36(b) that remittance transfer providers disclose the exchange rate that applies to a remittance transfer in pre-payment disclosures and receipts and that the provider must make available to the designated recipient the amount of currency stated in the disclosure means, in effect, that a remittance transfer provider must commit to a specific exchange rate at the time the sender authorizes the transfer, even if disclosed days or weeks before the date of the transfer. As a result, the commenter stated some senders might use the three-day cancellation period applicable to transfers scheduled before the date of transfer strategically in order to seek better exchange rates. Thus, if prior to expiration of the cancellation period, the remittance transfer provider offered an exchange rate that was more favorable to the sender than the exchange rate set for the transfer, the commenter felt that a sender might decide to cancel the remittance transfer and immediately rebook it at the more favorable exchange rate available that day. Conversely, if the provider offered an exchange rate that was less favorable than the earlier rate, the sender would benefit from having locked in a better rate that the remittance transfer provider was contractually bound to apply to the transfer. The commenter stated that this phenomenon would increase providers' exchange rate risk and the cost of managing such risk. Some industry commenters indicated that, at least in some instances, providers would refuse to offer consumers the ability to schedule remittance transfers before the date of transfer if the Bureau required providers to disclose, before the cancellation deadline passes, the exchange rate that will apply to any such remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters agreed that the use of estimates in disclosures may be appropriate for initial transfers in series of preauthorized remittance transfers, but stated that, if remittance transfer providers were allowed to use estimates in disclosures for such transfers, senders should be informed they would not receive actual notice of the price of the transfer or of the amount to be received by the designated recipient during the periods when the senders can cancel the transfers. Some of these commenters also stated that if remittance transfer providers were permitted to use estimates for transfers scheduled before the date of transfer, then providers should also be required to ensure that senders eventually receive disclosures that state the actual exchange rates that will apply to the remittance transfers prior to the expiration of the cancellation periods for those transfers, or the providers should be required to commit to the method they will use to set the exchange rate on the date of transfer.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Finally, an individual commenter and several industry commenters stated that disallowing estimates would disproportionately harm smaller remittance transfer providers. The individual commenter suggested that small providers would not have the scale or expertise to manage exchange rate risk in a manner necessary to comply with any requirement that providers disclose accurate exchange rates before the date of transfer. Relatedly, industry commenters stated that not allowing estimates for disclosures provided prior to the date of a remittance transfer would disproportionately affect small providers relative to large providers. Similarly, several industry commenters urged the Bureau to allow estimates because without estimates they would not be able to manage risk and thus would have no reliable way of providing accurate disclosures before the date of transfer of the exchange rate and related figures. If the February Final Rule remained unchanged, these providers stated they would not permit consumers to schedule transfers before the date of transfer.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Based on comments received and the Bureau's outreach and further analysis, and in order to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it necessary and proper to use its EFTA section 904(a) and (c) authority to adopt proposed § 1005.32(b)(2) with the changes discussed in more detail below concerning (i) when estimates will be allowed under this provision and (ii) situations where the amount to be transferred may vary.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>The Bureau continues to believe that the market for remittance transfers scheduled significantly before of the date of transfer, including preauthorized remittance transfers, is currently limited. Nevertheless, the Bureau believes that if it did not adopt this provision to allow estimates, the subset of remittance transfers providers that currently offer senders the ability to schedule remittance transfers before the date of transfer; or are considering doing so; may limit such offerings because the providers (or their business partners) would not want to absorb or manage the risk associated with fixing the exchange rates that would apply to transfers far in advance of the date of transfer. As described above, many retail exchange rates are set through reference to wholesale currency markets in which rates can fluctuate frequently. As a result, whenever there are time lags between when the retail rate applied to a transfer is set, when the relevant foreign currency is purchased, and when funds are delivered, a remittance transfer provider (and/or its business partner) may face losses due to unexpected changes in the value of the relevant foreign currency. Generally, this risk may increase the more time that elapses between these events.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>The Bureau is concerned that in many cases, remittance transfer providers (or their business partners) will find it more difficult or costly to manage the risks related to disclosing accurate exchange rates before the date of transfer and that such risks may be exacerbated because the final rule allows senders to cancel transfers up to three business days before the date of transfer. The Bureau is also concerned that, because remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer are a relatively small portion of the remittance transfer market, providers may decide not to develop necessary risk management tools and may not offer transfers scheduled before the date of transfer. The Bureau further believes that for such transactions, allowing estimates may be beneficial to senders in many instances even though senders may receive less information before the date of transfer than they would under the February Final Rule. If senders received exchange rates set long before the dates of remittance transfers, in some cases, senders would receive a more favorable exchange rate than they would otherwise, while other senders would receive less favorable rates, depending on the fluctuation of the exchange rate between the date of disclosure and the date of transfer. However, allowing estimates may result in lower costs for remittance transfer providers (and thus lower prices for all senders of transfers scheduled before the date of transfer), as well as wider access for senders to the convenience of one-time transfers scheduled before the date of transfer and preauthorized remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Furthermore, while under § 1005.32(b)(2) senders will not always receive disclosures of a fixed exchange rate and amount of currency to be received, the Bureau believes that even estimates of these amounts will still permit consumers to learn some information that could assist in comparing remittance transfer providers' price models. As is discussed below (see § 1005.32(d)) estimates provided pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2) must be based on the exchange rate or, where applicable, the estimated exchange rate based on an estimation methodology permitted under § 1005.32(c) that the provider would have used or did use that day in providing disclosures to a sender requesting such a remittance transfer to be made on the same day.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection notice="2012-19702" date="2013-10-28">
<title>Time Period for Estimates for Transfers Scheduled Before the Date of Transfer</title>
<analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.32(b)(2)(i) stated that estimates could be provided for certain items required in the pre-payment disclosure, receipt, or combined disclosure if a remittance transfer was requested or authorized by the sender more than ten days before the date of transfer. The Bureau sought comment on whether ten days is an appropriate period after which estimates should no longer be permitted or whether the period should be longer or shorter.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>The Bureau received a number of comments on the appropriate period for use of estimates in disclosures provided for all remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer (rather than just one-time transfers scheduled before the date of transfer and first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers as covered by the February Proposal). Industry commenters supported estimates in disclosures for all remittance transfers scheduled more than ten days before the date of transfer, but many also urged the Bureau to allow estimates for remittance transfers scheduled ten or less days before for many of the reasons discussed above; namely the risk management and other challenges that they believed that remittance transfer providers would face if they were required to disclose exchange rates far in advance of remittance transfers. These commenters urged a shorter period within which they would not be permitted to provide estimated disclosures. Commenters also expressed concern that providers would refuse to offer consumers the ability to schedule transfers ten or fewer days before the date of transfer because providers would not want to disclose exact exchange rates between one and ten days before the date of transfer.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Industry commenters suggested a range of alternatives less than ten days. One industry commenter proposed allowing estimates for all transfers scheduled more than one day before the date of transfer because it was unable to manage the risks associated with providing accurate exchange rates more than one day in advance. Other industry commenters provided similar rationales for proposed periods of less than two days, two or three days, five days, and seven days. One trade group commenter urged the Bureau to allow estimates for all remittance transfers scheduled two or more days before the date of transfer and to require only a two-day cancellation period because a shorter cancellation period would still allow senders to cancel transfers and would exacerbate providers' foreign currency risks.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters favored the ten-day rule expressed in the February Proposal. One of these commenters explained that although it understood the difficulty of disclosing the actual exchange rate before the date of transfer, its research showed that consumers are better informed when they receive accurate and precise disclosures, and thus this commenter preferred to expand the period during which estimates would not permitted.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting a revised § 1005.32(b)(2)(i), which permits remittance transfer providers to estimate exchange rates and, in some instances fees and taxes, for all remittance transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer, rather than for one-time transfers or the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers scheduled more than ten days before the date of transfer as proposed. As is explained above regarding the use of estimates generally, compared to the proposal permitting estimates in some cases more than ten days before the date of transfer, the Bureau believes this provision will allow providers increased flexibility to continue to offer transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer while still requiring accurate disclosures for transfers scheduled less than five days before the date of transfer (except when estimates are permitted by § 1005.32(a) or (b)(1)).</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>The Bureau recognizes that for transfers scheduled three or four business days before the date of transfer, providers will have to disclose an accurate exchange rate (rather than an estimate) while maintaining the sender's right to cancel the transfer. See § 1005.36(c). The Bureau believes, however, that as compared to transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer, risk management needs are reduced for transfers scheduled less than five business days before the date of transfer. The Bureau believes that providers should not be permitted to use provide estimates, other than as permitted under § 1005.32(a) and (b)(1), for transfers scheduled less than five business days before the date of transfer. Because risk is generally more manageable closer to the date of transfer, the Bureau believes consumers should receive accurate disclosures during that period. To the extent that any remittance transfer providers that currently offer, or plan to offer, remittance transfers scheduled in advance may be inclined to limit senders' ability to schedule transfers three or four business days before the date of transfer (because they are unwilling or unable to provide an accurate exchange rate while cancellation remains possible), the Bureau believes there is a limited loss of convenience to consumers as compared to a scenario where estimates are disallowed for a longer period. The Bureau presumes that any consumer has the option of a same-day transfer with a remittance transfer provider who does not offer two, three, or four days advance scheduling.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Thus, in the final rule, § 1005.32(b)(2)(i) provides that estimates may be provided in certain cases for the amounts to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) through (vii) if a remittance transfer is scheduled by a sender five or more business days before the date of transfer.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed revisions to comment 32-1 to explained when the proposed § 1005.32(b)(2) exception would apply. The Bureau is revising proposed comment 32-1 to clarify that § 1005.32(b)(2) permits estimates to be used for certain information if the remittance transfer is scheduled by a sender five or more business days before the date of the transfer, for disclosures described in § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) and (a)(2)(i). Section 1005.36(a)(1)(i) and (a)(2)(i) concern pre-payment disclosures and receipts for one-time transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer and preauthorized remittance transfers and are discussed in detail below.</analysisParagraph>

<title>Estimates of the Amount to Be Transferred</title>
<analysisParagraph>The Bureau also sought comment on whether remittance transfer providers should be allowed flexibility to estimate certain information in disclosures for the first scheduled transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers where the exact amount of the transfer can vary. The few commenters on this issue suggested that the need to estimate the amount to be transferred could occur in two scenarios. For example, an industry commenter suggested that senders may want to transfer a variable amount (such as a paycheck or government benefits payment in an amount that varies), or may want to prearrange the delivery of a fixed amount of one currency from an account denominated in another currency, e.g., U.S. dollars (which would result in the transfer amount depending on the exchange rate). The Bureau believes it unnecessary to adjust the rule expressly to address the first potential scenario. No industry commenter stated that it currently allows customers to schedule transfers of a variable amount, and the Bureau is not aware of business models permitting such remittance transfers. Under the final rule, § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) requires a receipt to be provided a reasonable time prior to a subsequent preauthorized transfer if the amount to be transferred changes from the first transfer in series a of preauthorized remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>As to the latter scenario, outreach confirmed that the marketplace currently permits some consumers to schedule series of recurring remittance transfers in which the transfer amount is fixed in a currency other than that in which the transfer is funded. To address this latter scenario, the Bureau believes it necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and to facilitate compliance to exercise its EFTA section 904(a) and (c) authority to adopt an additional revision to § 1005.32(b)(2). Specifically, the final rule states in § 1005.32(b)(2)(i) that if, at the time the sender schedules a transfer, the remittance transfer provider agrees to a sender's request to fix the amount to be transferred in the currency in which the remittance transfer will be received and not the currency in which it is funded, estimates may also be provided for the amounts to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(i) through (iii), except as provided in § 1005.32(b)(2)(iii) (i.e., in certain cases the provider can disclose estimates of the fees and taxes imposed on the transaction and the total amount of the transaction, as well as the amount that will be transferred in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded).</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>New comment 32(b)(2)-1 provides an example regarding the exception for remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer in which the amount to be transferred is fixed in a currency other than that in which the transfer is funded.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>New comment 32(b)(2)-2 clarifies the interaction between the final rule and § 1005.10(d) of subpart A of Regulation E.[13] It states that to the extent § 1005.10(d) requires, for an electronic fund transfer that is also a remittance transfer, notice when a preauthorized electronic fund transfer from the consumer's account will vary in amount from the previous transfer under the same authorization or from the preauthorized amount, that provision applies even if subpart B would not otherwise require notice before the date of transfer. However, insofar as § 1005.10(d) does not specify the form of such notice, a notice sent pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) will satisfy § 1005.10(d) as long as the timing requirements of § 1005.10(d) are satisfied.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Relatedly, the Bureau solicited comment as to whether a remittance transfer provider should be permitted to estimate the date in the foreign country on which the funds will be available, if the amount of the transfers under the preauthorized remittance transfer arrangement varies from one transfer to the next, and the remittance transfer provider does not know the exact date on which the remittance transfer must be sent at the time that disclosures are given for the first transfer. 77 FR 6310, 6318 (suggesting that this situation could arise, for example, if remittance transfers are being used to pay bills with due dates that are not known in advance). No comments were received on this issue. The Bureau is not adopting any changes to the February Final Rule regarding estimates of the date on which funds will be available.</analysisParagraph>

<title>32(b)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(iii)</title>
<analysisParagraph>To accommodate the allowance for estimates of exchange rates in certain disclosures for remittance transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer, several additional provisions are included in § 1005.32(b)(2) regarding other information disclosed in pre-payment disclosures and receipts.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.32(b)(2)(ii) permitted a remittance transfer provider to estimate taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider for transfers scheduled more than ten days before the date of transfer only if those taxes were a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient and are to be disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be received. Proposed § 1005.32(b)(2)(iii)(A) similarly permitted a remittance transfer provider to estimate fees imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider for transfers scheduled more than ten days before the date of transfer only if those fees were a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient and are to be disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be received. Unlike proposed § 1005.32(b)(2)(ii), proposed § 1005.32(b)(2)(iii) contained an additional provision § 1005.32(b)(2)(iii)(B); that, in effect, reasserted the temporary exception (in § 1005.32(a)) for “insured institutions” to estimate fees. Because § 1005.32(a) remains unchanged in the final rule and continues to apply regardless of the application of § 1005.32(b)(2), the Bureau believes it unnecessary to include a provision incorporating that exception.<footnote ref="14">For the same reasons, the Bureau is not adopting the proposed change to comment 32(c)(1)-1, concerning potential transmittal routes or proposed comment 32(b)(2)-1 concerned fees imposed on the remittance transfer provider by a person other than the remittance transfer provider. The Bureau received no comments regarding comment 32(b)(2)-1. Nevertheless, the Bureau is not adopting the proposed comment because it is duplicative. See § 1005.32(a) and (b)(2)(ii). The final rule continues, in effect, to allow estimates for the fees described in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) in two circumstances: (i) Where the fees are calculated as a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2)(ii); or (ii) where an “insured institution” as defined in § 1005.32(a)(3) is permitted to estimate fees under the temporary exception in § 1005.32(a).</footnote></analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>As a result, there is no longer a need for separate provisions for estimation of the fees and taxes in the disclosure required under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). In place of proposed § 1005.32(b)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(iii)(A), as well as proposed comment 32(b)(2)-7, the Bureau adopts § 1005.32(b)(2)(ii), which provides that fees and taxes described in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) may be estimated under § 1005.32(b)(2)(i) only if the exchange rate is also estimated under § 1005.32(b)(2)(i) and the estimated exchange rate affects the amount of fees and taxes under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). The revised provision expands the ability to estimate fees and taxes to cover not just situations in which the tax or fee is a percentage of the amount of the funds transferred, but also to cover situations in which a tax or fee may otherwise vary depending on the exchange rate (i.e. a tax is only charged on transfers that exceed a certain threshold denominated in the currency in which the funds will be received, and that amount depends on the exchange rate).</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>The final rule also includes § 1005.32(b)(2)(iii). This provision allows remittance transfer providers to estimate fees and taxes in certain disclosures provided for remittance transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer, when a remittance transfer provider agrees to a sender's request to fix the amount to be transferred in the currency in which the remittance transfer will be received and not the currency in which it is funded. But § 1005.32(b)(2)(iii) explains that fees and taxes described in § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) may be estimated under § 1005.32(b)(2)(i) only if the amount that will be transferred in the currency in which it is funded is also estimated under § 1005.32(b)(2)(i), and the estimated amount affects the amount of such fees and taxes.</analysisParagraph>

<title>Disclosure of Formulas Used to Calculate the Exchange Rate</title>
<analysisParagraph>In the February Proposal, the Bureau sought comment on whether, in lieu of providing an estimate of the exchange rate for a remittance transfer scheduled before the date of transfer, the Bureau should allow providers to disclose a formula that will be used to calculate the exchange rate that will apply to such a transfer, and that is based on information that is publicly available prior to the time of transfer. The sender could then use that formula to calculate the exchange rate that will apply to the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Several industry and consumer group commenters supported the use of such a formula although they disagreed on whether its use should be optional. One industry commenter stated that the disclosure of a formula could eliminate the need for remittance transfer providers to manage exchange rate risk and would reduce the burden on providers as compared to a rule that required providers to disclose actual exchange rates for transfers scheduled before the date of transfer. Another industry commenter favored disclosure of formulas rather than estimates for remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer because the volatility of currency markets makes disclosure of estimates of limited utility to senders trying to gauge the pricing of a particular provider's services. Other industry commenters stated that either a formula or use of estimates could reduce compliance burden on providers. One consumer group favored the use of formulas whenever the Bureau would also permit estimates on disclosures provided more than ten days before the date of transfer because formulas may make comparison shopping easier for consumers.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>In contrast, one industry commenter preferred disclosure of estimates to formulas because, the commenter stated, for remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer, it would be easier to provide an estimate of an exchange rate to senders and such an estimate would be easier for a sender to understand.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that, in some cases, compared to either an estimated or an actual exchange rate, a well-designed formula could better serve consumers and potentially reduce burden on remittance transfer providers. The Bureau believes that, given the nature of foreign currency markets, in many cases, any estimate of the exchange rate for a remittance transfer scheduled days or weeks in the future may not provide a highly precise indication to the sender of the exchange rate that would actually be applied to the sender's transfer. By contrast, a formula that will be used to calculate the exchange rate applicable to a transfer could provide more certainty to a sender as to relative prices or the pricing mechanism used and allow the sender to calculate the actual exchange rate that will apply to a transfer, before the date of the transfer. In addition, disclosing a formula would reduce the need for a remittance transfer provider to manage the currency risk associated with providing an accurate exchange rate for a transfer scheduled before the date of transfer.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Nevertheless, the Bureau does not believe it is appropriate to allow for the use of formulas in disclosures at this time. First, the Bureau is concerned that the disclosure of formulas themselves could be confusing to senders if not designed in a way that consumers can understand. Second, if a formula was not required to be disclosed by all remittance transfer providers, the Bureau is concerned that consumer confusion could be a problem if some providers disclose formulas while others disclose estimates. However, the Bureau expects to continue evaluating how disclosures can most effectively inform senders without imposing undue burden on remittance transfer providers.</analysisParagraph>

<title>32(c) and (d) Bases for Estimates</title>
<analysisParagraph>The February Proposal sought comment on the appropriate method to calculate estimates of exchange rates, and related figures, under the proposed exception for remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer. However, the Bureau did not propose specific changes to § 1005.32(c), which concerns the allowable bases for estimates of required disclosures.<footnote ref="15">In the February Proposal, the Bureau did propose conforming changes to comment 32(c)(3)-1 that referenced the renumbered provisions relating to the permanent exception for transfers to certain countries (what is § 1005.32(b)(1) in the final rule). The Bureau received no comments on the proposed changes to this comment, and the Bureau is adopting it as proposed.</footnote> The Bureau received a few comments on this issue but none that suggested revisions to § 1005.32(c). However, in order to allow remittance transfer providers to give estimates for transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer and to make those estimates more useful for consumers, the Bureau believes revisions to the allowable bases for such estimates are necessary for disclosures that contain estimates pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2). These changes are adopted in a new § 1005.32(d).</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>The February Final Rule contains, in § 1005.32(c)(1), three specific approaches by which a remittance transfer provider may estimate an exchange rate when using the exceptions for estimates in § 1005.32(a) and (b) (now renumbered as (b)(1)). Section 1005.32(c) further allows a provider to use an estimation approach not listed in § 1005.32(c)(1) so long as the designated recipient receives the same, or greater, amount of funds than the remittance transfer provider disclosed, as required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii). Under, the February Proposal, the bases for determining estimates under proposed § 1005.32(b)(2) would have been the same as the bases for determining estimates under the existing provisions permitting estimates in the February Final Rule (i.e., § 1005.32(c)).</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>In commenting on proposed § 1005.32(b)(2), industry commenters noted that if allowed, the most likely way that they would “estimate” the future exchange rate would be by providing the actual rate available on the day of scheduling to customers sending same-day transfers. One commenter explained that while they could always disclose the actual rate available on the date the transfer is scheduled, the commenter cautioned that many variables could alter exchange rates over time. Furthermore, industry commenters stated that they believed that senders typically do little comparison shopping when scheduling transfers before the date of transfer and instead are more interested in reliable and timely transfers from a remittance transfer provider that the senders trust.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>To clarify the proper bases for disclosing estimates, the Bureau adds § 1005.32(d), which states that estimates provided pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2) must be based on the exchange rate or, where applicable, the estimated exchange rate based on an estimation methodology permitted under § 1005.32(c) that the provider would have used or did use that day in providing disclosures to a sender requesting such a remittance transfer to be made on the same day. If, in accordance with § 1005.32(d), a remittance transfer provider uses a basis described in § 1005.32(c) but not listed in § 1005.32(c)(1), the provider is deemed to be in compliance with § 1005.32(d) regardless of the amount received by the designated recipient, so long as the estimation methodology is the same as that the provider would have used or did use in providing disclosures to a sender requesting such a remittance transfer to be made on the same day.<footnote ref="16">Section 1005.32(c)(1) contains three methodologies for providing estimates. If a provider chooses to use a non-listed method, § 1005.32(c) explains that the amount received by the designated recipient must be the same, or greater then, the estimated amount disclosed to the sender.</footnote></analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>The Bureau is making two changes to the bases for estimates applicable to the exception for estimates for remittance transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer. The first requires providers to base estimates on the exchange rate (or estimated exchange rate) that the provider would have used or did use that day in providing disclosures to a sender requesting such a remittance transfer to be made on the same day. In order to allow for easier comparison shopping and for estimates to be of use to senders, the Bureau believes that remittance transfer providers should base their estimates on similar methodologies. The Bureau believes that if providers uniformly disclose the actual rate available that day as the estimated rate for transfers scheduled before the date of transfer, senders will more easily be able to compare the offerings of various remittance transfer providers by comparing rates and fees. Moreover, commenters did not suggest any other reliable method to estimate future exchange rates.
</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>The second change concerns estimates pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2) by remittance transfer providers that can otherwise use the two statutory exceptions in § 1005.32(a) or (b)(1). As explained above, providers of transfers scheduled before the date of transfer who cannot use one of the enumerated methods for estimating in § 1005.32(c)(1) will have difficulties guaranteeing that the designated recipient receives the same, or greater, amount of funds than the remittance transfer provider disclosed. The Bureau is concerned about remittance transfer providers that use estimates pursuant to § 1005.32(a) or (b)(1), and that, as permitted by § 1005.32(c), have chosen to use an estimation methodology other than those specified in § 1005.32(c)(1). With regard to such methodologies, § 1005.32(c) requires that if a provider bases an estimate on an approach that is not listed in that paragraph, the provider is deemed to be in compliance with the paragraph so long as the designated recipient receive the same, or greater, amount of funds than the provider disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii). The Bureau is concerned that due to the fluctuations in wholesale foreign exchange markets discussed above, in many cases, remittance transfer providers that have developed estimation methodologies that reliably satisfy the requirements of § 1005.32(c) for same-day transfers, may not be able to do the same for estimates of exchange rates provided for transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of a remittance transfer. The Bureau also recognizes that the elimination of this guarantee will reduce burden on providers.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>The Bureau expects that most remittance transfer providers, if allowed, will set the retail exchange rate that applies to a remittance transfer scheduled before the date of transfer on the date of that transfer, in rough reference to one of several measures of the wholesale or market exchange rates. Insofar as there are a large number of factors that may alter exchange rates, the Bureau believes that in most scenarios, there is no method to predict with precision what those market or wholesale rates will be far before the date on which a remittance transfer provider sets a retail exchange rate. Thus, the requirement in § 1005.32(c) that providers who cannot use a listed methodology guarantee that the amount received by the designated recipient must be the same, or greater than, the estimated amounts disclosed to the sender, is not feasible for disclosures provided five or more business days before the date of transfer. Nevertheless, because providers must use the same method for transfers scheduled before the date of transfers as they use for same-day transfers, the Bureau believes there will still be consistency in the estimation methodology.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>New comment 32(d)-1 explains that when providing an estimate pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2), § 1005.32(d) requires that a remittance transfer provider's estimated exchange rate must be the exchange rate (or estimated exchange rate) that the remittance transfer provider would have used or did use that day in providing disclosures to a sender requesting such a remittance transfer to be made on the same day. If, for the same-day remittance transfer, the provider could utilize either of the other two exceptions permitting the provision of estimates in § 1005.32(a) or (b)(1), the provider may provide estimates based on a methodology permitted under § 1005.32(c). For example, if, on February 1, the sender schedules a remittance transfer to occur on February 10, the provider should disclose the exchange rate as if the sender was requesting the transfer be sent on February 1. However, if at the time payment is made for the requested transfer, the remittance transfer provider could not send any remittance transfer until the next day (for reasons such as the provider's deadline for the batching of transfers), the remittance transfer provider can use the rate (or estimated exchange rate) that the remittance transfer provider would have used or did use in providing disclosures that day with respect to a remittance transfer requested that day that could not be sent until the following day.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Procedures for Resolving Errors</title>
      <analysisParagraph>As noted above, consumers may be permitted to schedule a series of preauthorized remittance transfers in which the transfer amount is fixed in a currency other than that in which the transfer is funded. Thus, § 1005.32(b)(2)(i) permits estimates to be provided for, among other things, the total amount of the transfer. In light of this new provision, a revision to § 1005.33(a)(1)(i) is necessary to clarify that disclosing an estimate of the total amount of the transfer in this case would not result in an error.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Under the February Final Rule, § 1005.33(a)(1)(i) states than “error” means an incorrect amount paid by a sender in connection with a remittance transfer. Comment 33(a)-1 explains that § 1005.33(a)(1)(i) covers circumstances in which a sender pays an amount that differs from the total amount of the transaction, including fees imposed in connection with the transfer, stated in the receipt or combined disclosure provided under § 1005.31(b)(2) or (3).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is revising this provision to exempt from the definition of error estimates of the total amount of the transfer provided in accordance with the new exception in § 1005.32(b)(2). This exception allows for, among other things, an estimate of the amount to be transferred if, at the time the sender schedules the transfer, the remittance transfer provider agrees to a sender's request to fix the amount to be transferred in the currency in which the remittance transfer will be received and not the currency in which it is funded. When the amount to be transferred is estimated under this section, the provider is also permitted to estimate the total amount of the transaction (i.e., the amount to be paid by the sender).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Thus, as revised, § 1005.33(a)(1)(i) states that the term error means an incorrect amount paid by a sender in connection with a remittance transfer, unless the disclosure stated an estimate of the amount paid by a sender in accordance with § 1005.32(b)(2) and the difference results from application of the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes, rather than any estimated amount. As discussed in detail below, when a remittance transfer provider estimates of the total amount of the transfer in a receipt provided at least five or more business days before the date of transfer (see § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) and (a)(2)(i)), the provider must also send a receipt without the estimate after the transfer (see § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) and (a)(2)(ii)). Thus, the sender will still receive a receipt with the actual amount the sender paid for the transfer and can still assert an error based on the disclosure of the amount paid in that receipt.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Transfers Scheduled Before the Date of Transfer</title>
      <analysisSection>
<title>Overview</title>
<analysisParagraph>The February Final Rule sets forth several procedures for the timing, content, and accuracy of pre-payment disclosures and receipts for preauthorized remittance transfers. At the same time, the February Proposal sought comment on whether further adjustments were necessary to address one-time transfers scheduled before the date of transfer and preauthorized remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Specifically, the February Final Rule treats the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers the same as most other remittance transfers by requiring that accurate (not estimated) figures be disclosed in the pre-payment disclosure and receipt. But in recognition of the potential risks associated with setting exchange rates and the potential difficulty of determining the amount to be provided to a designated recipient weeks or months before subsequent transfers, the February Final Rule does not require that disclosures for an entire series of preauthorized remittance transfers be provided when the sender initially requests the transfer and authorizes payment. Instead, the February Final Rule requires remittance transfer providers to issue pre-payment disclosures and receipts for each subsequent transfer closer to the dates of the individual transfers. In particular, under the February Final Rule, the pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent transfer must be provided within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of the transfer, and the receipt for each subsequent transfer generally must be provided no later than one business day after the date on which the transfer is made. The pre-payment disclosure and receipt for each subsequent transfer must be accurate when the respective transfer is made, unless a statutory exception applies. See § 1005.36(b). Senders must also be permitted to cancel these transfers up to three business days before the date of transfer. See § 1005.36(c).</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Because the Bureau was concerned that even with the modifications permitted by the February Final Rule, the disclosure requirements could pose difficulty for certain remittance transfers scheduled significantly before the date of transfer, the February Proposal asked a number of questions regarding whether to make further adjustments to the disclosure and cancellation regime for these transfers. The Bureau sought input on how to manage the importance to senders of accurate and timely disclosures, permit growth of this portion of the remittance transfer market, and limit industry compliance burdens in light of the potential risks associated with providing accurate exchange rates and the difficulty of determining the amount to be received by designated recipients for a particular transfer.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Specifically, the February Proposal sought comments on a number of potential changes to the February Final Rule concerning the type, timing, and accuracy of pre-payment disclosures and receipts a sender should receive in connection with one-time transfers and the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers scheduled to occur more than ten days before the date of transfer. The February Proposal also sought comment on whether senders should receive disclosures for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers and, if so, what form those disclosures should take. Finally, the February Proposal sought comment on what cancellation rules should apply to these transactions and how and when those rules should be disclosed to senders.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Based on comments received, the Bureau is amending the February Final Rule to allow providers increased flexibility, while maintaining requirements that senders receive sufficient and timely information to help inform their selection of remittance transfer providers and help them understand the terms of their remittance transfers. With respect to timing, the final rule requires pre-payment disclosures and receipts for one-time transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer and the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers to be provided in the same manner as they are provided for all other transfers (i.e., at request and at payment authorization). The final rule also requires providers to give senders additional, accurate receipts after the transfer is sent if prior disclosures contained estimates pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2). The Bureau is also maintaining the three-business-day cancellation period in § 1005.36(c). Finally, although the Bureau is generally eliminating the requirement to provide pre-payment disclosures for subsequent remittance transfers in a preauthorized series, the Bureau is adopting a new § 1005.36(d) to require disclosure of upcoming dates of transfer and cancellation provisions a reasonable time before the dates of such transfers.</analysisParagraph>

<analysisParagraph>As is discussed further below, to further the purposes of the EFTA and facilitate compliance, the Bureau finds it necessary and proper to use its EFTA section 904(a) and (c) authority to adopt § 1005.36(a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii), and (a)(2)(i) through (iii) and to eliminate the requirement to provide pre-payment disclosures for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. Sections 1005.36(a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii), (a)(2)(i), and (a)(2)(ii) are revised from the February Final Rule. Section 1005.36(a)(2)(iii) is a new provision in the final rule.</analysisParagraph>

<title>36(a)(1) Timing of Disclosures for One-Time Transfers Scheduled Before the Date of Transfer and the First in a Series of Preauthorized Remittance Transfers</title>
<analysisParagraph>Section 1005.36(a) of the February Final Rule addresses the timing of required disclosures for preauthorized remittance transfers. Section 1005.36(a)(1) of the February Final Rule requires that, for the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the pre-payment disclosure and receipt be provided in the same manner as required for all other transfers. In the February Proposal, the Bureau sought comment on whether to make further adjustments in the disclosure rules for preauthorized remittance transfers and certain other transfers scheduled before the date of transfer.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>With respect to the timing of pre-payment disclosures and receipts given to senders upon request of and payment for a transfer, the Bureau received few comments, apart from those raising the concerns discussed earlier regarding the disclosure of exact exchange rates far before the date of a remittance transfer. Largely, industry commenters did not raise other concerns about the requirement that remittance transfer providers give pre-payment disclosures (or combined disclosures) when transfers are requested and prior to payment and receipts (if no combined disclosures were provided) when payment is authorized for either one-time transfers scheduled before the date of transfer or the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers. In the final rule, the Bureau maintains the requirement from the February Final Rule that for any one-time remittance transfer scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer, and for the first transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, a remittance transfer provider must provide a pre-payment disclosure and a receipt to the sender subject to the same timing rules that apply to any one-time transfer.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>For clarity and consistency, the Bureau is revising § 1005.36(a)(1) from the February Final Rule as a new § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) by adjusting the provision to apply both to a one-time advance transfer scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer and the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, rather than just the latter. The Bureau is also clarifying that remittance transfer providers may use combined disclosures, pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(3), for transfers covered by this provision.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>The Bureau also requested comment on what follow-up disclosures, if any, should be provided to senders after authorization of a remittance transfer scheduled before the date of transfer. Specifically the Bureau asked whether a second receipt with accurate information should be provided to a sender within a reasonable time period prior to such a transfer, if the remittance transfer provider previously disclosed estimates pursuant to proposed § 1005.32(b)(2).</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Most industry commenters argued against requiring a second receipt with accurate figures to be given prior to a remittance transfer when the original pre-payment disclosure and receipt contained estimates. These commenters argued that to the extent such a provision required disclosure of accurate figures ten days before the date of transfer, it would render the exception allowing providers to disclose estimates meaningless.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>To the extent the Bureau would instead allow a second receipt to contain estimates, industry commenters argued that giving senders three documents (a pre-payment disclosure when requesting the remittance transfer, a receipt when payment is authorized for the transfer, and a second receipt a reasonable time before the transfer) would be confusing and unhelpful to senders. One industry commenter suggested there would be limited value added by a second receipt that could contain information that, other than updated estimated exchange rates and associated figures, would be identical to the information included in the initial receipt. Another commenter expressed concern that a sender could be confused into thinking that a remittance transfer provider has made a single transfer multiple times or that an error had occurred, necessitating the additional disclosure. Industry commenters also stated that they thought senders would benefit little from additional disclosures before a transfer, particularly when any such benefit is balanced against the increased upfront and ongoing costs to the remittance transfer providers of giving senders the additional receipt. These commenters argued that providers would pass these costs on to senders. Finally, as an alternative to a second pre-transfer receipt, one industry commenter suggested that providers give senders receipts reflecting actual figures (and not estimates) after the providers send the transfers to the designated recipient. Consumer group commenters argued that receipts with actual figures (and not estimates) be provided to senders a reasonable time prior to the date of each transfer.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>In light of the Bureau's decision to allow the use of estimates in certain disclosures for remittance transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of a remittance transfer rather than ten days as originally proposed, the Bureau believes that a follow-up receipt provided closer to the date of the transfer is not likely to provide significant benefit to senders in many cases. For example, if a remittance transfer provider schedules a remittance transfer one month before the date of transfer, and discloses an estimated exchange rate at that time, and then provides a sender a receipt with an accurate exchange rate only four business days before the date of transfer (because unless a statutory exception applies, § 1005.32(b)(2) of the final rule permits estimates only for disclosures five or more business days before the date of transfer) the receipt might not reach the sender before the expiration of the three-business-day cancellation period in § 1005.36(c). Conversely, if this follow-up receipt were sent five or more business days before the date of transfer, estimates of certain amounts would be permitted under § 1005.32(b)(2). The Bureau believes that such a disclosure generally would be of little additional value as compared to the initial estimate provided in the pre-payment disclosure and receipt required by § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) if the wholesale rate, and thus the retail rate, had not moved significantly since the initial estimate was provided.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Although the Bureau is not requiring a second receipt closer to the time of transfer, the Bureau believes that for every remittance transfer, where a sender receives a disclosure that contains estimates pursuant to § 1005.32, the sender should also receive an accurate post-transfer disclosure that informs the sender of the actual exchange rate (as well as fees, taxes, and other figures) applied to the transfer. Thus, to further consumer protections, the Bureau is adopting a revised § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii), which requires that if the disclosures provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) contain estimates as permitted by § 1005.32(b)(2) (for transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer), the provider must mail or deliver to the sender an additional receipt meeting the requirements described in § 1005.31(b)(2) no later than one business day after the date of transfer.[17] If the transfer involves the transfer of funds from the sender's account held by the provider, the receipt required by § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) may be provided on or with the next periodic statement for that account, or within 30 days after the date of the transfer if a periodic statement is not provided. As required by § 1005.36(b)(3), which is discussed below, this receipt must contain accurate figures unless estimates are allowed by § 1005.32(a) or (b)(1).</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>As many remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer are conducted by senders who have accounts with remittance transfer providers, the Bureau believes the final rule may relieve many providers of having to provide receipts immediately after each preauthorized remittance transfer or after one-time transfer scheduled five or more business days before the date of the transfer. In addition, the Bureau believes that an accurate receipt will ensure that senders receive accurate accountings of their transfers. Furthermore, to the extent that senders of preauthorized remittance transfers want to comparison shop based on price for future transfers, these receipts may be a mechanism that allows senders to better understand providers' pricing mechanisms (by allowing a sender to know the exchange rate applied to each transfer) and the amount received by the designated recipient.</analysisParagraph>

<title>36(a)(2) Timing of Disclosures for Subsequent Preauthorized Remittance Transfers</title>
<analysisParagraph>The February Final Rule contains disclosure provisions specific to subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers (i.e., all preauthorized remittance transfers after the first in the series of transfers). Section 1005.36(a)(2)(i) of the February Final Rule requires that a remittance transfer provider also mail or deliver a pre-payment disclosure to the sender for each subsequent transfer and requires the disclosure to be mailed or delivered within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of each subsequent transfer. This provision is in lieu of the general timing rule, which would have required that a pre-payment disclosure for each transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers be given at the time of the initial request (and thus a sender would receive a disclosure for every preauthorized transfer when requesting the entire series). See § 1005.31(e)(1). Section 1005.36(a)(2)(ii) in the February Final Rule requires a receipt to be mailed or delivered no later than one business day after the transfer or, for account-based transactions, on or with the next regularly scheduled periodic statement or within 30 days after payment is made for the remittance transfer if a periodic statement is not provided.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>In the February Proposal, the Bureau sought comment on an alternative to the requirement in the February Final Rule that a pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfer be provided within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of transfer: Whether the pre-payment disclosure requirement for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers should be eliminated.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Industry commenters generally favored eliminating the requirement for providing pre-payment disclosures for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers for many of the same reasons these commenters disfavored a rule requiring accurate pre-payment disclosures for other transfers scheduled before the date of transfer. These commenters argued that a pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent transfer would be unnecessary, potentially confusing to senders, and burdensome to providers. For example, one commenter argued that senders schedule preauthorized remittance transfers for purposes of convenience and that senders typically do not comparison shop to complete each recurring transfer. The same commenter expressed concern that the requirement of an additional pre-payment disclosure might cause some providers to no longer allow consumers to schedule transfers before the date of transfer.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>In contrast, one consumer group commenter supported requiring pre-payment disclosures to be provided to senders ten days before each subsequent transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers (and stated that if estimates were permitted for disclosures related to such transfers, that those disclosures contain current estimates). This commenter urged that the Bureau maintain the requirement in the February Final Rule for pre-payment disclosures so that senders have additional information regarding the details of each preauthorized remittance transfer prior to such transfer.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Upon consideration of these comments and to facilitate compliance, the Bureau is eliminating the requirement to provide a pre-payment disclosure within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer. Thus, the Bureau is eliminating what was § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) in the February Final Rule. The Bureau is doing so for several reasons. The Bureau is concerned that the requirement in the February Final Rule; a pre-payment disclosure sent a reasonable time prior to each subsequent remittance transfer; might provide senders only a limited amount of information because pre-payment disclosures for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers sent five or more business days before the date of transfer could contain estimates, pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2). In addition, in some scenarios, this could create a potential for confusing and overlapping disclosures and receipts.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Conversely, the Bureau believes that if it mandated that pre-payment disclosures be sent less than five business days before a subsequent transfer such that the disclosures could not contain estimates under § 1005.32(b)(2), the disclosure would be of little use to the sender for the upcoming transfer as it could be received too close to (or after) the cancellation deadline. Separately, confusion for senders could exist in some circumstances where preauthorized remittance transfers are scheduled relatively close together or receipts are provided with periodic statements. In these cases, a sender might receive a post-transfer receipt from a prior preauthorized remittance transfer close in time to a pre-payment disclosure for the next transfer. These documents, with potentially differing exchange rates and other figures, might confuse senders unnecessarily.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>The Bureau also believes that eliminating the requirement for pre-payment disclosures for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers is appropriate in part because senders will receive some relevant information in receipts for prior preauthorized remittance transfers. The final rule requires that for any preauthorized remittance transfer, the remittance transfer provider must provide a sender a receipt with accurate information (except to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32(a) or (b)(1)). A receipt from the prior transfer with accurate amounts may provide the sender with information that could educate the sender not only about the prior transfer but also about the provider's practices generally, which may help the sender judge whether to continue with the provider for future preauthorized remittance transfers. The Bureau believes a sender can learn about a remittance transfer provider's exchange rate practices from what the designated recipient actually received from the prior transfers in the series. In addition, the receipt provided for the initial transfer in a series provides information about the fees and taxes that will apply to all subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers, unless a change necessitates a new disclosure, as discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Although the Bureau is eliminating the requirement that a remittance transfer provider provide a pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the Bureau remains concerned that previously disclosed figures (other than the estimates themselves) could change, rendering the figures disclosed in the pre-payment disclosure provided for the initial transfer inaccurate as applied to the subsequent transfers.[18] Comment 31(f)-1 to the February Final Rule explains that under the general timing and accuracy rules in subpart B of Regulation E, providers must give senders new pre-payment disclosures before accepting payment if previously provided pre-payment disclosures are inaccurate. However, since a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or, as discussed below, .36(a)(2)(i), may serve as a disclosure with respect to multiple subsequent preauthorized transfers, the temporal elements disclosed on those receipts would only be accurate with respect to the transfer to occur after the receipt is provided.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Thus, the Bureau is adopting a new § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) to specifically address certain changes in terms related to subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. Section 1005.36(a)(2)(i) states that if any of the information on the most recent receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or § 1005.36(a)(2)(i), other than the temporal disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) (Date Available) and (b)(2)(vii) (Transfer Date), is no longer accurate with respect to a subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer for reasons other than as permitted by § 1005.32, then the remittance transfer provider must provide an updated receipt meeting the requirements described in § 1005.31(b)(2) to the sender. The provider must mail or deliver this receipt to the sender within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of the next subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer. Such receipt must clearly and conspicuously indicate that it contains updated disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>New comment 36(a)(2)-1 clarifies when the disclosure required by § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) must be provided. Specifically, it states that when a sender schedules a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the provider is generally not required to provide a pre-payment disclosure prior to the date of each subsequent transfer. However, § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) requires the provider to provide a pre-payment disclosure and receipt for the first in the series of preauthorized remittance transfers in accordance with the timing requirements set forth in § 1005.31(e). See § 1005.36(a)(1)(i). While certain information in those disclosures is expressly permitted to be estimated (see § 1005.32(b)(2)(i) through (iii)), other information is not permitted to be estimated, or is limited in how it may be estimated. When any of the information on the most recent receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i), other than the temporal disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) (the Date Available) and (b)(2)(vii) (the Transfer Date), is no longer accurate with respect to a subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer for reasons other than as permitted by § 1005.32, the provider must provide, within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of the next preauthorized remittance transfer, a receipt that complies with § 1005.31(b)(2) and which discloses, among the other disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(2), the changed terms.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>For example, if the provider discloses in the pre-payment disclosure for the first in the series of preauthorized remittance transfers that its fee for each remittance transfer is $20 and, after six preauthorized remittance transfers, the provider increases its fee to $30 (to the extent permitted by contract law), the provider must provide the sender a receipt that complies with §§ 1005.31(b)(2) and 1005.36(b)(2) within a reasonable time prior to the seventh transfer. Barring a further change, this receipt will apply to transfers after the seventh transfer. Or, if, after the sixth transfer, a tax increases from 1.5% of the amount that will be transferred to the designated recipient to 2.0% of the amount that will be transferred to the designated recipient, the provider must provide the sender a receipt that complies with §§ 1005.31(b)(2) and 1005.36(b)(2) within a reasonable time prior to the seventh transfer. In contrast, § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) does not require an updated receipt where an exchange rate, estimated as permitted in § 1005.32, changes.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>New comment 36(a)(2)-2 explains that in order to clearly and conspicuously indicate that the provider's fee has changed as required by § 1005.36(a)(2)(i), the provider could, for example, state on the receipt: “Transfer Fees (UPDATED) * * * $30.” To the extent that other figures on the receipt must be revised because of the new fee, the receipt should similarly indicate that those figures are updated.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>In the February Proposal, the Bureau also solicited comment on whether it should provide a safe harbor interpreting the “within a reasonable time” standard for providing a pre-payment disclosure for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. Although such a disclosure is no longer required, the same “within a reasonable time” requirement now applies to receipts required by § 1005.36(a)(2)(i). The bulk of the comments received on how to interpret “within a reasonable time” concerned industry commenters' concerns regarding the requirement in the February Final Rule that any required pre-payment disclosures reflect the actual exchange rates that will apply to preauthorized remittance transfers. Industry commenters stated that it would be difficult to disclose accurate exchange rates ten days before the date of a remittance transfer. Insofar as § 1005.32(b)(2) allows estimates in disclosures provided for remittance transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer, this concern should be alleviated. Industry commenters generally stated that if estimates were permitted, ten days was a reasonable period of time.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>New comment 36(a)(2)-3 explains if a receipt required by § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) (or, as discussed below, required by § 1005.36(d)(1)) is mailed, the receipt would be considered to be received by the sender five business days after it is posted in the mail. If hand delivered or provided electronically, the receipt would be considered to be received by the sender at the time of delivery. Thus, if the provider mails the receipt not later than ten business days before the scheduled date of the transfer, or hand or electronically delivers the receipt not later than five business days before the scheduled date of the transfer, the provider would be deemed to have mailed or delivered the receipt within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of the subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau is modifying § 1005.36(a)(2)(ii) from the February Final Rule, which requires receipts for all subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. As adopted, § 1005.36(a)(2)(ii) explains when receipts must be sent. It states that unless a receipt was provided in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) that contained no estimates pursuant to § 1005.32, the remittance transfer provider must mail or deliver to the sender a receipt described in § 1005.31(b)(2) no later than one business day after the date of the transfer. If the remittance transfer involves the transfer of funds from the sender's account held by the provider, the receipt required by this paragraph may be provided on or with the next periodic statement for that account, or within 30 days after the date of the transfer if a periodic statement is not provided.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau is adopting an additional disclosure requirement for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers as § 1005.36(a)(2)(iii), which requires providers to provide the disclosures required by § 1005.36(d) in accordance with the timing requirements of that section. Section 1005.36(d) is discussed in more detail below.</analysisParagraph>

<title>36(b) Accuracy</title>
<analysisParagraph>The February Final Rule contains, in § 1005.36(b), requirements for the accuracy of disclosures for preauthorized remittance transfers. Under that provision in the February Final Rule, the pre-payment disclosures and receipt for the first scheduled transfers in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers are required to be accurate at the time of payment (i.e., they must comply with § 1005.31(f), which states that disclosures must be accurate when a sender makes payment for the remittance transfer, except to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32). For subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers, as discussed above, the February Final Rule requires providers to give accurate pre-payment disclosures as of when the transfer is made within a reasonable time prior to each transfer and then to provide an accurate receipt after each transfer.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>To further compliance and to enhance consumer protections, the Bureau finds it necessary and proper to use its EFTA section 904(a) and (c) authority to adopt a revised § 1005.36(b). The Bureau is revising § 1005.36(b) to address the accuracy of receipts provided for remittance transfers that are scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer, as well as preauthorized remittance transfers. The Bureau is adopting § 1005.36(b)(1), which states that for a one-time transfer scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer or the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, disclosures provided in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) must comply with § 1005.31(f) by being accurate when the sender makes payment, except to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>For subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers, the Bureau is adopting § 1005.36(b)(2), which states that for each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer, the most recent receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i) must be accurate as of when such transfer is made, except: (i) The temporal elements required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) (Date Available) and (b)(2)(vii) (Transfer Date) must be accurate only if the transfer is the first transfer to occur after the disclosure was provided, and (ii) to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32. As noted above, since a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i) may serve as a disclosure with respect to multiple subsequent preauthorized transfers, the temporal elements disclosed on those receipts need only be accurate with respect to the transfer to occur after the receipt is provided.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>To address situations in which receipts may be provided after the date of a remittance transfer, the Bureau is adopting a new § 1005.36(b)(3). That provision states that such receipts (provided pursuant to either § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) or (a)(2)(ii)) must be accurate as of when the remittance transfer to which it pertains is made, except to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32(a) or (b)(1).</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 36(b)-1 addressed estimates and, in particular, stated that providers may use any of the exceptions set forth in § 1005.32, to the extent applicable. This comment is adopted largely as proposed, with changes to reflect the newly adopted § 1005.32(b)(2), which allows for estimates in certain disclosures for transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer, and the revised § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) and (a)(2)(i), which permit use of estimates under § 1005.32(b)(2). The comment also notes that when estimates are permitted, they must be disclosed in accordance with § 1005.31(d).</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>New comment 36(b)-2 explains that, for a subsequent transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i), except for the temporal disclosures in that receipt required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) (Date Available) and (b)(2)(vii) (Transfer Date), applies to each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer unless and until it is superseded by a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(2)(i). For each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer, only the most recent receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i) must be accurate as of the date each subsequent transfer is made. As a receipt may apply to multiple transfers in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) (i.e. disclosure of the date in the foreign country on which funds will be available to the designated recipient) need not be accurate for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers that occur after the first transfer to which the receipt pertains.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Finally, new comment 36(b)-3 clarifies that a receipt required by § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) must accurately reflect the details of the transfer to which it pertains and may not contain estimates pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2). However, the remittance transfer provider may continue to disclose estimates to the extent permitted by § 1005.32(a) or (b)(1). In providing receipts pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) or (a)(2)(ii), § 1005.36(b)(2) and (b)(3) do not allow a remittance transfer provider to change figures previously disclosed on a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i), unless a figure was an estimate or based on an estimate disclosed pursuant to § 1005.32. Thus, for example, if a provider disclosed its fee as $10 in a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) and that receipt contained an estimate of the exchange rate pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2), the second receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) must also disclose the fee as $10. The Bureau is adopting this comment to clarify that the purpose of receipts required by § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) and (a)(2)(ii) is to provide a sender with the actual exchange rate applied to the transfer (unless the statutory exceptions for estimates apply) rather than the estimate previously disclosed for the transfer pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2). Thus, the final rule does not permit a provider to change other items, such as non-estimated fees and taxes, from a prior disclosure applicable to that transfer on the post-transfer receipt.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
<title>36(c) Cancellation</title>
<analysisParagraph>The February Final Rule contains cancellation requirements for remittance transfers. For most remittance transfers, § 1005.34(a) requires the remittance transfer provider to comply with a cancellation request received no later than 30 minutes after the sender makes payment for the remittance transfer if: (i) The sender's request allows the provider to identify the sender's name and address or telephone number and the specific transaction to be cancelled; and (ii) the transferred funds have not been picked up by the designated recipient or deposited into the recipient's account. For remittance transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, including preauthorized remittance transfers, § 1005.36(c) of the February Final Rule requires the remittance transfer provider to comply with a sender's request for cancellation if the request: (i) Enables the provider to identify the sender's name and address or telephone number and the particular transfer to be cancelled; and (ii) is received at least three business days before the scheduled date of the remittance transfer. Section 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) requires the provider to include a statement about the sender's cancellation rights, using the language set forth in Model Form A-37 of Appendix A to subpart B or substantially similar language.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>The Bureau is amending Regulation E in this final rule to, among other things, clarify the obligations of the remittance transfer provider for remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer and to provide senders with information to calculate the cancellation deadline for remittance transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer. As discussed above, the Bureau is making certain adjustments to the disclosure and timing requirements in other sections of the final rule in order to enhance senders' ability to properly determine the cancellation deadline for remittance transfers, to enable senders to more easily identify and track preauthorized remittance transfers that occur in close proximity to one another, and to facilitate industry compliance with the cancellation disclosure requirements.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the final rule adds § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii), which requires remittance transfer providers to disclose the date of transfer in certain receipts provided to senders pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(2). These requirements apply only to remittance transfers scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, as well as the initial transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers. As discussed below, § 1005.36(d)(2)(ii) also requires future transfer dates to be disclosed for subsequent transfers in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, for which payment is made by the sender four or fewer business days before the date of the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>However, as discussed below, the Bureau is retaining in § 1005.36(c) the requirement that a remittance transfer provider must comply with any oral or written request to cancel a remittance transfer if the request to cancel is received at least three business days before the scheduled date of the remittance transfer. The Bureau is also adopting a new § 1005.36(d) to require providers to disclose the future dates of transfer, cancellation requirements, and provider's contact information for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers no more than 12 months and no less than five business days before the date of the transfer. This timing requirement for these disclosures does not apply to subsequent transfers in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers for which payment is made by the sender four or fewer business days before the date of the transfer. For this subset of transfers, the information required by § 1005.36(d)(1), including future dates of transfer, must instead be included in the receipt for the first transfer in the series of preauthorized remittance transfers provided in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(1)(i). For subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers and transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of transfer, any receipt provided after the transfer is made in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) or (a)(2)(ii) must include the date of transfer (and cancellation requirements) for the transfer that is the subject of the receipt.</analysisParagraph>

<analysisParagraph>As noted above, section 919(d)(3) of the EFTA provides the Bureau broad discretion to fashion cancellation requirements for remittance transfers. In the February Final Rule, the Bureau adopted in § 1005.36(c) specific cancellation requirements for remittance transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer. In adopting the three-business-day cancellation rule for such transfers, the Bureau explained that the general 30-minute cancellation period would not be appropriate for remittance transfers scheduled far in advance because it would permit only a short time for cancellation even though the remittance transfer might not occur for many days or even months. 77 FR 6194, 6268. Thus, the Bureau concluded that a three-business-day time period is more beneficial because it provides senders with more time to decide whether to go through with the transaction while giving remittance transfer providers sufficient time to process a cancellation request before the transaction is executed.

<analysisParagraph>In the February Proposal, the Bureau explained that further consideration of the three-business-day cancellation rule and its application to remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer was necessary to ensure that the rule provided appropriate protection to senders without imposing an undue burden on providers. 77 FR 6310, 6321. Accordingly, the Bureau solicited comment on whether the three-business-day deadline to cancel advance transfers accomplishes these goals, or whether the deadline to cancel should be more or less than the three days adopted in the February Final Rule. The Bureau also solicited comment on whether it is important to maintain consistency between the cancellation deadline adopted for preauthorized remittances transfers in § 1005.36(c) and the cancellation deadline for preauthorized electronic fund transfers in § 1005.10(c)(1). 77 FR 6310, 6321. Finally, the Bureau solicited comment on whether the deadline to cancel would be easier to calculate if the cancellation period was based on calendar days instead of business days.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Several commenters addressed the cancellation deadline for remittance transfers scheduled three or more business days in advance. Both industry and consumer group commenters generally agreed that the three-business-day time period for cancellation in the February Final Rule appropriately balances the interests of both parties to the transfer. One industry commenter opposed the three-business-day time period for cancellation; this commenter proposed as an alternative a five-day cancellation period, arguing that the Bureau should take into consideration providers' existing compliance obligations under other laws as well. Another industry commenter posited that, if the Bureau does not amend the definition of “remittance transfer provider” to exclude depository institutions executing certain types of international wire transfers, cancellation should be allowed only until a transfer has been executed by a depository institution. One industry commenter agreed that the Bureau should continue to require the deadline to cancel to be expressed in business days as opposed to calendar days.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Although most commenters expressed support for the three-business-day cancellation period, a few industry commenters conditioned their support on whether and to what extent remittance transfer providers may be required to disclose to senders the exchange rates that apply to transfers scheduled before the date of transfer. One industry commenter stated that the three-business-day cancellation period would be appropriate only if a remittance transfer provider were not required to disclose the actual exchange rates that would apply to preauthorized remittance transfers ten days before the dates of such transfers. The industry commenter, however, also agreed that senders should be able to cancel preauthorized remittance transfers or other remittance transfers scheduled to take place in the future, but that the cancellation requirements should be balanced with a shorter time period for exchange rate disclosure. Another industry commenter argued that the three-business-day cancellation requirement would present a substantial risk of loss to a remittance transfer provider if the provider were required to disclose the exchange rate that would apply to a remittance transfer more than one day before the scheduled date of transfer. This commenter suggested that the Bureau establish a bifurcated cancellation structure for transfers scheduled before the date of transfer under which: (i) the 30-minute cancellation period in § 1005.34(a) would apply for any transfer for which the provider discloses the actual exchange rate; and (ii) the three-business-day cancellation period established in § 1005.36(c) would apply for any transfer in which the provider discloses an estimated exchange rate.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>The Bureau recognizes the concern expressed by a few industry commenters that remittance transfer providers may incur additional risk if the time period to cancel a transfer extends beyond the date upon which a remittance transfer provider must disclose the actual exchange rate that will apply to a remittance transfer. As the Bureau noted in the discussion regarding § 1005.32(b)(2)(i), whenever there are time lags between when the retail exchange rate that applies to a remittance transfer is set, when the relevant foreign currency is purchased, and when funds are delivered, a remittance transfer provider (and/or its business partner) may face losses due to unexpected changes in the value of the relevant foreign currency. The Bureau's decision in § 1005.32(b)(2) of the final rule to allow remittance transfer providers to provide an estimated exchange rate in certain disclosures for remittance transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer should help alleviate these concerns. (See discussion above regarding § 1005.32(b)(2) for additional analysis of foreign exchange risks.) As a result, under the final rule, a remittance transfer provider will not be required to disclose, prior to the date of the transfer, an actual, as opposed to an estimated, exchange rate if the transfer is scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer. This five-business-day period is shorter than the more than ten day period proposed in the February Proposal and reduces the period during which a remittance transfer provider that permits transfers to be scheduled before the date of transfer may face additional foreign exchange risks due to the gap between the time the provider sets an exchange rate and the date of the transfer. And, while there is a short period outside the cancellation window in which the remittance transfer provider is required to disclose actual rather than estimated exchange rates, the Bureau believes that providers may be able to manage the foreign currency risks or may choose not to offer consumers the ability to schedule remittance transfers in this period. The Bureau does not believe the latter option presents a substantial risk of harm to senders, because it believes that any provider that generally permits consumers to schedule remittance transfers in advance will at least retain the option for consumers to schedule their transfers the day of or five or more business days before the date of the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Accordingly, the Bureau concludes that the three-day-business cancellation period for remittance transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer as adopted in the February Final Rule is appropriate. The Bureau believes that cancellation rights are important because they allow senders time to review the disclosure for accuracy and cancel the transaction when warranted by a change in circumstances. In addition, the Bureau believes the three-business-day cancellation period strikes an appropriate balance between sender and remittance transfer provider interests. This time period is close enough to the transfer date so that senders will know if there are circumstances warranting a cancellation, while it gives providers an adequate amount of time to process a cancellation request. Finally, as the Bureau noted in the February Final Rule, the three-business-day cancellation period is consistent with the cancellation requirement for electronic fund transfers. 77 FR 6194, 6268. Since many remittance transfer providers also provide electronic fund transfers, maintaining similar regulatory regimes should minimize burden and facilitate compliance.</analysisParagraph>

<title>Disclosure of Cancellation Period in Pre-Payment Disclosures for Subsequent Preauthorized Remittance Transfers</title>
<analysisParagraph>In the February Proposal, the Bureau solicited comment on whether a remittance transfer provider should be required to disclose the cancellation period in the pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent remittance transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, rather than in the receipt for each subsequent transfer. As the Bureau recognized in the February Proposal, this issue would be relevant only if the pre-payment disclosure requirement in § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) of the February Final Rule is retained in this rulemaking. 77 FR 6310, 6323.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau is revising the disclosure requirements for preauthorized remittance transfers to eliminate the requirement that remittance transfer providers provide a pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent transfer in series of preauthorized remittance transfers. Instead, the final rule requires that, in most circumstances, a receipt for each subsequent transfer be provided to the sender. Consequently, the Bureau's inquiry of whether the cancellation disclosure should be provided in the pre-payment disclosure or the receipt for each subsequent transfer is now generally moot. Since there generally is no longer a requirement to provide a pre-payment disclosure for subsequent transfers, the sender's cancellation rights must be disclosed on any receipt provided in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(2) and (d)(2) (see discussion below), as applicable.</analysisParagraph>

<title>36(d) Additional Requirements for Subsequent Preauthorized Remittance Transfers</title>
<analysisParagraph>Under the February Final Rule, remittance transfer providers are required to provide senders with both a pre-payment disclosure and a receipt for each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer in a series. Specifically, the pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent transfer must be provided within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of the transfer, and the receipt for each subsequent transfer generally must be provided no later than one business day after the date on which the transfer is made. As discussed above, however, the Bureau is concerned with balancing the interest of consumers in receiving timely disclosures for subsequent transfers with the interests of industry in reducing risks and developing this market segment. Thus, in the February Proposal, the Bureau sought comment on a number of issues related to subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers, including whether senders should receive disclosures for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers and, if so, what form those disclosures should take. 77 FR 6310, 6223. The February Proposal also sought comment on what cancellation rules should apply to these transfers and when those rules should be disclosed to senders.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>The Bureau received few comments in response to its inquiry regarding disclosure of cancellation requirements for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. Among those received, there was little consensus regarding how cancellation rights for subsequent preauthorized transfers should be disclosed. One industry commenter advocated for flexibility on the disclosure requirements to minimize costs. Another industry commenter asserted that the cancellation rights should be included only in the first pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent transfer, while a consumer group commenter posited that a subsequent pre-payment disclosure disclosing cancellation rights should be sent before each subsequent transfer. Only one industry commenter supported including the statement regarding cancellation rights for the next scheduled transfer on the current receipt, arguing that it would give senders more time to cancel the transfer than if the cancellation rights were included in a pre-payment disclosure provided before the subsequent transfer.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Having eliminated the pre-payment disclosure requirement for subsequent transfers and altered the requirements for when a receipt would have to be provided for a subsequent transfer in the final rule, the Bureau is concerned that senders may not receive adequate and timely information regarding the dates of upcoming transfers and, thus, may not know when their right to cancel those transfers expires. Further, as discussed above regarding § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii), even when senders receive disclosures regarding their cancellation rights, they may not have the type of information needed to determine the date on which the right to cancel a subsequent transfer expires. The Bureau is also concerned that, where senders receive a number of receipts in close proximity to one another as part of a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, senders may not have information that would be helpful in distinguishing to which transfer a particular receipt applies.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Accordingly, to further the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to adopt a new § 1005.36(d), which amends the disclosure requirements for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. Section 1005.36(d)(1)(i) states that, for any subsequent transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the remittance transfer provider must disclose to the sender: (A) the date the provider will make the subsequent transfer, using the term “Future Transfer Date,” or a substantially similar term; (B) a statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation as described in § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv); and (C) the name, telephone number(s), and Web site of the remittance transfer provider. Section 1005.36(d)(1)(ii) states that if the future date or dates of transfer required to be disclosed by this paragraph are described as occurring in regular periodic intervals, e.g., the 15th of every month, rather than as a specific calendar date or dates, the remittance transfer provider must disclose any future date or dates of transfer that do not conform to the described interval.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Section 1005.36(d)(2)(i) establishes the general timing requirements for disclosures required by § 1005.36(d)(1), stating that, except as described in § 1005.36(d)(2)(ii), the disclosures required by § 1005.36(d)(1) must be received by the sender no more than 12 months, and no less than five business days prior to the date of any subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer to which it pertains. Section 1005.36(d)(2)(i) also states that the disclosures required by § 1005.36(d)(1) may be provided in a separate disclosure or on one or more disclosures required by subpart B related to the same series of preauthorized remittance transfers, so long as the consumer receives the required information for each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer in accordance with the timing requirements of § 1005.36(d)(2)(i).</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that information regarding cancellation rights is as important to subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers as it is to other transfers. Accordingly, as noted in the discussion regarding § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii), senders need the date of transfer to determine, among other things, when the cancellation period for a certain preauthorized transfer expires. At the same time, the Bureau recognizes that when authorizing a preauthorized remittance transfer, the sender establishes a recurring schedule. The Bureau believes the repetitive and cyclical nature of preauthorized remittance transfers reduces the need for senders to receive notice of the cancellation period in individual notices sent immediately before each subsequent transfer, and warrants additional flexibility to remittance transfer providers to determine the timing and type of disclosure to be used to advise senders of their cancellation rights for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. The Bureau notes, however, that such notices must be provided within a timeframe that would be useful to senders and is concerned that a notice provided more than 12 months before the date of such transfers would likely be unhelpful to senders. Likewise, a notice received fewer than five business days before the date of transfer may not provide the sender with enough time to determine whether cancellation is warranted and, thus, would also not be helpful to senders.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>The Bureau also recognizes that for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers scheduled four or fewer business days before the date of the transfer, remittance transfer providers will be unable to provide the disclosures regarding the future date of transfer and cancellation rights five or more business days before the date of transfer. Accordingly, § 1005.36(d)(2)(ii) states that for any preauthorized remittance transfer for which the date of transfer is four or fewer business days after the date payment is made for that transfer, the information required by § 1005.36(d)(1) must be provided on or with the receipt described in § 1005.31(b)(2), or disclosed as permitted by § 1005.31(a)(3) and (a)(5), for the initial transfer in that series in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(1)(i). For example, if, on Monday, a sender authorizes a series of preauthorized remittance transfers in which the initial transfer occurs that day and the first subsequent transfer is scheduled to occur on Wednesday, the 30-minute cancellation period under § 1005.34(a) would apply to both transfers. If, however, in the same series of preauthorized remittance transfers the second subsequent remittance transfer is scheduled to occur on Friday, the three-business-day cancellation period would apply to that transfer. For either subsequent transfer, the provider would be unable to provide the required information at least five business days before the date of the transfer. In that instance, the provider would be required to disclose the cancellation period and future date of transfer for the subsequent remittance transfer on or with the receipt provided for the initial preauthorized remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>As a result, preauthorized remittance transfers scheduled fewer than three business days from the date of the transfer are now subject to different disclosure requirements than standalone remittance transfers scheduled fewer than three business days from the date of the transfer. With respect to the latter, there is no requirement to disclose the date of transfer or future date of transfer on receipts. The Bureau, however, believes these two sets of transfers present different concerns warranting different treatment. Preauthorized remittance transfers by definition are authorized to recur at substantially regular intervals. As a result, as discussed above, preauthorized remittance transfer present a higher risk of confusion since, depending on the frequency of the subsequent transfers in the series, senders may receive multiple receipts at or around the same time and, absent identifying information such as the date of transfer, may be unable to identify the transfer to which a particular receipt applies. One-time transfers scheduled in advance do not generally present the same risks because in most instances the sender would schedule a single transfer at any given time as opposed to a series of transfers and should not have difficulty identifying the transfer to which the receipt applies. Further, if disclosures were only required for subsequent preauthorized transfers occurring at least three business days in the future, consumers may mistakenly believe that no transfers were scheduled on any days prior to that time.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Thus, while the Bureau believes the date of transfer would be helpful to senders of preauthorized remittance transfers, it does not believe such information is necessary for standalone transfers scheduled fewer than three business days from the date of the transfer. As stated above, the Bureau believes that it will be simpler for remittance transfer providers to program their receipts to include the transfer date information consistently for preauthorized transfers than to create separate receipt forms for one-time and preauthorized remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>New § 1005.36(d)(3) and (d)(4) address formatting and accuracy requirements for disclosures required under § 1005.36(d)(3). Section 1005.36(d)(3) states that the information required by § 1005.36(d)(1)(i)(A) generally must be disclosed in close proximity to the other information required by § 1005.36(d)(1)(i)(B). Section 1005.36(d)(4) states that any disclosure required by § 1005.36(d)(1) must be accurate as of the date the subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer to which it pertains is made.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adopting commentary to provide further guidance on the application of § 1005.36(d). Comment 36(d)-1 clarifies that § 1005.36(d)(2) permits remittance transfer providers some flexibility in determining how and when the disclosures required by § 1005.36(d)(1) may be provided to senders. Comment 36(d)-1 states that the disclosure may be provided as a separate disclosure, or on or with any other disclosures required by subpart B of Regulation E related to the same series of preauthorized remittance transfers, provided that the disclosure and timing requirements in § 1005.36(d)(2) and other applicable provisions in subpart B are satisfied. For example, the required disclosures may be made on or with a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i); a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(2)(ii); or in a separate disclosure created by the provider. The comment also provides a fact pattern describing how a remittance transfer provider would comply with § 1005.36(d)(1).</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Comment 36(d)-2 clarifies that § 1005.36(d)(2)(i) requires that the sender receive disclosure of the date of transfer, applicable cancellation requirements, and the provider's contact information no more than 12 months and no less than 5 business days prior to the date of the subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer. Comment 36(d)-2 also cross-references comment 36(a)(2)-3 for purposes of determining when a disclosure required by § 1005.36(d)(1) is received by the sender.</analysisParagraph>
<analysisParagraph>Comment 36(d)-3 provides guidance on how the remittance transfer provider should disclose the date of transfer. Specifically, comment 36(d)-3 clarifies that the date of transfer of a subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer may be disclosed either as a specific date (e.g., July 19, 2013), or by using a method that clearly permits identification of the date of transfer, such as periodic intervals (e.g., the third Monday of every month, or the 15th of every month). Comment 36(d)-3 further clarifies that if the future dates of transfer are disclosed as occurring periodically and there is a break in the sequence, or the date of transfer does not conform to the described period, e.g., if a weekend or holiday causes the provider to deviate from the normal schedule, the provider should disclose the specific date of transfer for the affected transfer. Finally, comment 36(d)-4 clarifies the accuracy requirements for disclosures required by § 1005.36(d)(1). Comment 36(d)-4 explains that if any of the information required by § 1005.36(d)(1) changes, the provider must provide an updated disclosure with the revised information that is accurate as of when the transfer is made, pursuant to § 1005.36(d)(2).</analysisParagraph>
