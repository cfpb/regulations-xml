For example, overdraft fees that are imposed by a recipient's bank or funds that are garnished from the proceeds of a <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfer</ref> to satisfy an unrelated debt are not fees imposed on the <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfer</ref> because these charges are not specifically related to the <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfer</ref>.  <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">Account</ref> fees are also not specifically related to a <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfer</ref> if such fees are merely assessed based on general <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">account</ref> activity and not for receiving transfers.  Where an incoming <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfer</ref> results in a balance increase that triggers a monthly maintenance fee, that fee is not specifically related to a <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfer</ref>.  Similarly, fees that banks charge one another for handling a <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfer</ref> or other fees that do not affect the total amount of the transaction or the amount that will be received by the <ref target="1005-30-c" reftype="term">designated recipient</ref> are not fees imposed on the <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfer</ref>.  For example, an interchange fee that is charged to a <ref target="1005-30-f-1" reftype="term">provider</ref> when a <ref target="1005-30-g" reftype="term">sender</ref> uses a <ref target="1005-2-f" reftype="term">credit</ref> or debit card to pay for a <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfer</ref> is not a fee imposed upon the <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfer</ref>.  Fees that specifically relate to a <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfer</ref> may be structured on a flat per-transaction basis, or may be conditioned on other factors (such as <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">account</ref> status or the quantity of <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfers</ref> received) in addition to the <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfer</ref> itself.  For example, where an institution charges an incoming transfer fee on most customers' <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">accounts</ref>, but not on preferred <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">accounts</ref>, such a fee is nonetheless specifically related to a <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfer</ref>.  Similarly, if the institution assesses a fee for every transfer beyond the fifth received each month, such a fee would be specifically related to the <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfer</ref> regardless of how many <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfers</ref> preceded it that month.</content>

In such cases, the <ref target="1005-30-f-1" reftype="term">remittance transfer provider</ref> must calculate the fee to be disclosed under § <ref target="1005-31-b-1-vi" reftype="internal">1005.31(b)(1)(vi)</ref> in the currency of receipt using the exchange rate in § <ref target="1005-31-b-1-iv" reftype="internal">1005.31(b)(1)(iv)</ref>, including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by § 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate.  For example, an intermediary institution involved in sending an international wire transfer funded in U.S. dollars may impose a fee in U.S. dollars, but funds are ultimately deposited in the recipient's <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">account</ref> in Euros.  In this case, the <ref target="1005-30-f-1" reftype="term">provider</ref> would disclose the covered third-party fee to the <ref target="1005-30-g" reftype="term">sender</ref> expressed in Euros, calculated using the exchange rate disclosed under § <ref target="1005-31-b-1-iv" reftype="internal">1005.31(b)(1)(iv)</ref>, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate.  For purposes of § <ref target="1005-31-b-1-v" reftype="internal">1005.31(b)(1)(v)</ref>, <ref target="1005-31-b-1-vi" reftype="internal">(vi)</ref>, and <ref target="1005-31-b-1-vii" reftype="internal">(vii)</ref>, if a <ref target="1005-30-f-1" reftype="term">provider</ref> does not have specific knowledge regarding the currency in which the funds will be received, the <ref target="1005-30-f-1" reftype="term">provider</ref> may rely on a <ref target="1005-30-g" reftype="term">sender</ref>'s representation as to the currency in which funds will be received.  For example, if a <ref target="1005-30-g" reftype="term">sender</ref> requests that a <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfer</ref> be deposited into an <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">account</ref> in U.S. dollars, the <ref target="1005-30-f-1" reftype="term">provider</ref> may provide the disclosures required in § <ref target="1005-31-b-1-v" reftype="internal">1005.31(b)(1)(v)</ref>, <ref target="1005-31-b-1-vi" reftype="internal">(vi)</ref>, and <ref target="1005-31-b-1-vii" reftype="internal">(vii)</ref> in U.S. dollars, even if the <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">account</ref> is actually denominated in Mexican pesos and the funds are subsequently converted prior to deposit into the <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">account</ref>.  If a <ref target="1005-30-g" reftype="term">sender</ref> does not know the currency in which funds will be received, the <ref target="1005-30-f-1" reftype="term">provider</ref> may assume that the currency in which funds will be received is the currency in which the <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfer</ref> is funded.</content>

      <title>Section 1005.30 Remittance Transfer Definitions</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.30 incorporates certain definitions applicable to the remittance transfer provisions in subpart B of Regulation E.  Under the 2012 Final Rule, the introductory language in § 1005.30 states that “for purposes of this subpart, the following definitions apply.”  The Bureau is revising in the 2013 Final Rule this introductory language to clarify that, except as otherwise provided, for purposes of subpart B of Regulation E, the definitions in § 1005.30 apply.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>30(c) Designated Recipient</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Under the 2012 Final Rule, the term “designated recipient” is defined to mean any person specified by the sender as the authorized recipient of a remittance transfer to be received at a location in a foreign country.  Section 1005.30(c).  Comment 30(c)-1 further clarifies that a designated recipient can be either a natural person or an organization, such as a corporation. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.2(j) (definition of person).  Relatedly, § 1005.31(b)(2)(iii) requires a remittance transfer provider to disclose to a sender the name of the designated recipient.  Thus, the provider must ascertain this name from the sender at or before the receipt or combined disclosure is provided to the sender.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed below in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv), the Bureau is adopting certain revisions to 2012 Final Rule's error resolution provisions in § 1005.33 where a transfer is delivered to someone other than the designated recipient.  In particular, § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) creates a new exception to the definition of error in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) that applies when a sender provides an incorrect account number or recipient institution identifier, and the conditions in § 1005.33(h) are met.  Based on comments received regarding these proposed changes, and, in particular, concerning the specific mistakes by a sender that might result in an error under the 2012 Final Rule, the Bureau believes that it would be useful to provide further clarity on how the designated recipient is determined for purposes of determining whether an error has occurred or the new exception under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) applies.  In particular, the Bureau believes it necessary to address situations in which the transfer is delivered to someone other than the designated recipient named by the sender at the time of the transfer.  Therefore, the Bureau is clarifying in comment 30(c)-1 that the designated recipient is identified by the name of the person stated on the disclosure provided pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(iii).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>30(h) Third-Party Fees</title>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in detail below in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.31, the Bureau is eliminating the requirement to disclose certain recipient institution fees and to include such fees in the calculation of the disclosed amount to be received by the designated recipient.  In order to differentiate between fees that must be disclosed and included in the calculation of the amount to be received and those that are no longer required to be disclosed and included in such calculation, the Bureau is adopting definitions under § 1005.30(h) for covered third-party fees, required to be calculated and disclosed under subpart B of Regulation E, and non-covered third-party fees, which are not required to be calculated and disclosed.  Section 1005.30(h)(1) defines the term “covered third-party fees” to mean any fee that is imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider, except for non-covered third-party fees as described in § 1005.30(h)(2).  Section 1005.30(h)(2) defines the term “non-covered third-party fees” to mean any fees imposed by the designated recipient's institution for receiving a transfer into an account, except if the institution acts as an agent of the remittance transfer provider.  The rationale underlying the distinctions made in these definitions is discussed further below in the discussion of § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The 2013 Final Rule adds new commentary to 30(h) to explain the scope of these fees.  Drawing from applicable examples of fees imposed by a person other than the remittance transfer provider that were in comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii in the 2012 Final Rule, as well as proposed comments 31(b)(1)-iii and -iv which would have provided additional clarification on how to disclose recipient institution fees, comment 30(h)-1 explains that fees imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider include only those fees that are charged to the designated recipient and are specifically related to the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Comment 30(h)-1 additionally provides examples of fees that are or are not specifically related to the remittance transfer.  For example, overdraft fees that are imposed by a recipient's bank or funds that are garnished from the proceeds of a remittance transfer to satisfy an unrelated debt are not fees imposed on the remittance transfer because these charges are not specifically related to the remittance transfer.  Comment 30(h)-1 further states that account fees are also not specifically related to a remittance transfer if such fees are merely assessed based on general account activity and not for receiving transfers.  Comment 30(h)-1 additionally clarifies that fees that banks charge one another for handling a remittance transfer or other fees that do not affect the total amount that will be received by the designated recipient are not fees imposed on the remittance transfer. Comment 30(h)-1 also clarifies that fees that specifically relate to a remittance transfer may be structured on a flat per-transaction basis, or may be conditioned on other factors (such as account status or the quantity of remittance transfers received) in addition to the remittance transfer itself.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In addition, the 2013 Final Rule adds new commentary to explain the difference between covered and non-covered third-party fees.  Comment 30(h)-2.i explains that under § 1005.30(h)(1), a covered third-party fee means any fee that is imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider including fees imposed by a designated recipient's institution for receiving a transfer into an account where such institution acts as an agent of the provider for the remittance transfer.  As noted above, the rationale for this distinction is discussed further below in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi).  Comment 30(h)-2.ii provides examples of covered third-party fees including fees imposed on a remittance transfer by intermediary institutions in connection with a wire transfer and fees imposed on a remittance transfer by an agent of the provider at pick-up for receiving the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>With respect to non-covered third-party fees, comment 30(h)-3 explains that a non-covered third-party fee means any fee imposed by the designated recipient's institution for receiving a transfer into an account, unless the institution is acting as an agent of the remittance transfer provider.  It further provides as an example that a fee imposed by the designated recipient's institution for receiving an incoming transfer could be a non-covered third-party fee provided such institution is not acting as the agent of the provider.  In addition, comment 30(h)-3 explains that designated recipient's account in § 1005.30(h)(2) refers only to an asset account, regardless of whether it is a consumer asset account, established for any purpose and held by a bank, savings association, credit union, or equivalent institution.  It does not, however, include a credit card, prepaid card, or a virtual account held by an Internet-based or mobile telephone company that is not a bank, savings association, credit union or equivalent institution.  The rationale for this interpretation is also discussed further below in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1005.31 Disclosures</title>
      <analysisParagraph>EFTA sections 919(a)(2)(A) and (B) require a remittance transfer provider to disclose, among other things, the amount to be received by the designated recipient in the currency in which it will be received.  In the 2012 Final Rule under § 1005.31, the Bureau set forth the disclosure requirements for providers, including that providers disclose fees and taxes imposed by a person other than the provider.  Pursuant to EFTA section 919(a)(4)(A), the Bureau adopted an exception in § 1005.32(a) to provide that for certain disclosures by insured depository institutions or credit unions regarding the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient will be deemed to be accurate in certain circumstances so long as the disclosure provides a reasonably accurate estimate of the amount of currency to be received.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As noted in the December Proposal, after the Bureau issued the February Final Rule, industry participants continued to express concerns previously raised in response to the Board's proposed rule to implement EFTA section 919.  The concerns regarded the feasibility of disclosing fees imposed by a designated recipient's institution.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For the subset of transfers sent over the open network, industry participants stated that where a designated recipient's institution charges that recipient fees for receiving a transfer into an account, the remittance transfer provider would not typically know whether the recipient had agreed to pay such fees or how much the recipient had agreed to pay.  Some industry participants also requested guidance on whether and how to disclose recipient institution fees that can vary based on the recipient's status with the institution, quantity of transfers received, or other variables that are not easily knowable by the sender or the provider.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Separately, after the release of the February 2012 Rule, industry expressed concern about the disclosure of foreign taxes.  Industry participants argued first that it is significantly more burdensome to research and disclose subnational taxes, <em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> taxes imposed by regional, provincial, state, and other local governments than it is to research and disclose those taxes imposed by a country's central government because there are substantially more jurisdictions that could impose these subnational taxes.  Second, industry participants suggested that the guidance in the 2012 Final Rule under comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-2, which would allow remittance transfer providers to rely on senders' representations regarding variables that affect the amount of taxes imposed by a person other than the provider is insufficient where variables that influence the amount of taxes imposed by a person other than the provider are not easily knowable by the sender or the provider.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>With respect to both recipient institution fees and foreign taxes, industry stated that, to make the appropriate calculations and disclosures, remittance transfer providers might need to ask numerous questions of senders that senders might not understand or might not be able to answer.  With respect to fees, industry also stated that the calculations required to determine and disclose fees might vary with respect to each recipient institution because each of these institutions might have unique fee schedules that applied to particular accounts or different ways of imposing fees on remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In response to these comments, in the December Proposal, the Bureau proposed to provide additional flexibility and guidance regarding the calculation and disclosure of fees imposed by a designated recipient's institution for receiving a transfer into an account and taxes imposed by a person other than the remittance transfer provider.  The Bureau also proposed to eliminate the requirement to disclose regional, provincial, state, and other local foreign taxes and to include this amount in the disclosed amount received by the designated recipient.  The Bureau sought comment on whether these proposed changes achieved the goals stated in the December Proposal, or whether the existing rules or another alternative were preferable.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The majority of comments on the proposed changes regarding recipient institution fee and tax disclosures came from industry participants, including large banks, community banks, credit unions, non-depository institutions, and trade associations.  These commenters stated that they appreciated the Bureau's attempts to facilitate compliance, particularly with respect to the proposal to eliminate the required disclosure of subnational taxes.  However, many industry commenters argued that the proposed changes did not go far enough to ease compliance burden.  These industry commenters asserted that the proposed flexibility would not effectively mitigate the difficulty of researching the information needed to provide the recipient institution fee and foreign tax disclosures to senders.  Further, these industry commenters also expressed concern that the proposed estimation methods could increase consumer confusion due to discrepancies in the estimated amounts disclosed.  Moreover, industry commenters expressed concern that, under the estimation methods described in the December Proposal, the sender would usually receive a disclosure that showed the highest possible fee or tax that could apply.  As a result of this proposed highest estimation method, commenters stated that the disclosure could result in senders increasing the amount of money transferred more than was necessary to insure that a recipient received the expected amount.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Some consumer groups also expressed skepticism about the proposed estimation methods for a different reason: they believed that any additional estimation, beyond that permitted in the 2012 Final Rule, would be detrimental to senders because they would not know the precise amount of the transfer that would be received.  In contrast, other consumer groups supported the December Proposal and stated that it struck the proper balance of facilitating compliance, while also providing meaningful information to senders.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has carefully weighed these concerns and, for the reasons explained in detail below, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to exercise its exception authority under EFTA section 904(c) to eliminate the requirement to include certain recipient institution fees and taxes collected by a person other than the remittance transfer provider in the calculation of the amount to be received by the designated recipient pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii).  For the same reasons, the Bureau is eliminating the requirement to disclose these amounts under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi).  However, as noted above, the Bureau believes that a majority of remittance transfers are sent through closed networks whereby the recipient picks up the transfer from an agent.  In these cases, all fees imposed on the remittance transfer would continue to be required to be disclosed. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.30(h)(1).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For those minority of transfers where there may be non-covered third-party fees, the 2013 Final Rule requires that remittance transfer providers include, as applicable, a disclaimer on the pre-payment disclosure and receipt, or combined disclosure, indicating that the recipient may receive less due to fees charged by the recipient's bank. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii).  Similarly, if there may be taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, the 2013 Final Rule requires that providers include a disclaimer indicating that the recipient may receive less due to foreign taxes.  As part of these disclaimers, providers may choose to disclose an exact or estimated amount of these fees or taxes. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.32(b)(3).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As described in detail below, the 2013 Final Rule's Appendix and Model Forms have been amended to include samples of the new disclosures and disclaimers.  The Bureau is also making conforming edits in several other provisions in § 1005.31 to reflect the changes in the required disclosures.  These changes are described below.</analysisParagraph>

    <analysisParagraph>As is explained in detail below, as part of the changes adopted in the 2013 Final Rule, the Bureau is adding two optional disclosures. First, the Bureau is making optional the requirement to disclose non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider. See § 1005.33(b)(1)(viii). Second, the Bureau is creating an exception to the definition of error for certain mistakes made by senders. See § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D). If a provider wants to take advantage of this exception, it must provide a notice before the sender authorizes the remittance transfer consistent with § 1005.33(h)(3). While these two disclosures are optional, the Bureau believes it is important to ensure that they are made in a manner that is clear and conspicuous. Thus, the Bureau is amending § 1005.31(a)(1) to state that disclosures required by subpart B of Regulation E or permitted by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) or § 1005.33(h)(3) must be clear and conspicuous. Disclosures required by subpart B of Regulation E or permitted by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) or § 1005.33(h)(3) may contain commonly accepted or readily understandable abbreviations or symbols.</analysisParagraph>

    <title>Comment 31(b)-1 Disclosures Provided as Applicable</title>
    <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)-1 to the 2012 Final Rule provides examples of when certain disclosures may not be applicable and therefore need not be disclosed. Because of the changes that the Bureau is making with respect to the disclosure of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider, the 2013 Final Rule makes certain revisions to the commentary in the 2012 Final Rule for consistency and clarification. Comment 31(b)-1 clarifies that for disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(i) through (vii), a provider may disclose a term and state that an amount or item is “not applicable,” “N/A,” or “None.” Consistent with the changes made in the 2013 Final Rule regarding the disclosure of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, comment 31(b)-1 is revised to state that if fees are not imposed or taxes are not collected in connection with a particular transaction the provider need not provide the disclosures about fees and taxes generally required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii), the disclosures about covered third-party fees generally required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), or the disclaimers about non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the provider generally required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii).</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
    <title>Comment 31(b)-2 Substantially Similar Terms, Language, and Notices</title>
    <analysisParagraph>As adopted by the 2012 Final Rule, comment 31(b)-2 states that terms used on the disclosures under §§ 1005.31(b)(1) and (2) may be more specific than the terms provided and notes, as an example, that a remittance transfer provider sending funds to Colombia may describe a tax disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) as a “Colombian Tax” in lieu of describing it as “Other Taxes.” In light of the changes discussed below regarding the disclosure of foreign taxes, the 2013 Final Rule eliminates as an example the disclosure of a Colombian tax. Instead, the 2013 Final Rule provides as an example that a provider sending funds may describe fees imposed by an agent at pick-up as “Pick-up Fees” in lieu of describing them as “Other Fees.” In addition, in light of the new disclosures permitted by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) and § 1005.33(h)(3), the comment makes conforming changes to note that the foreign language disclosures required under § 1005.31(g) must contain accurate translations of the terms, language, and notices required by § 1005.31(b) or permitted by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) and § 1005.33(h)(3).</analysisParagraph>

    <title>31(b)(1)(ii) Fees Imposed and Taxes Collected by the Provider</title>
    <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) of the 2012 Final Rule states that a remittance transfer provider must disclose any fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider, in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, using the terms “Transfer Fees” for fees and “Transfer Taxes” for taxes or substantially similar terms. Since the Board's initial proposal, commenters have argued that because a tax is imposed by a government, and not by the provider, this provision may be confusing. The Bureau agrees that the original formulation may be inexact insofar as taxes are typically imposed by governments, even though they may be collected by providers. As a result, for clarity, the Bureau is revising this language to refer to taxes “collected” by the provider. This change is for clarification only and is not intended to change the meaning of the provision in the 2012 Final Rule. Consequently, § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) of the 2013 Final Rule is revised to state, more precisely, that a provider must disclose any fees imposed and any taxes collected on the remittance transfer by the provider.[5]</analysisParagraph>

    <title>Comment 31(b)(1)-1 Fees and Taxes</title>
    <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(1)-1 to the 2012 Final Rule provides general guidance on the disclosure of fees and taxes. Comment 31(b)(1)-1.i explains that taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the remittance transfer provider, which are required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii), include taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a State or other governmental body, and comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii focuses more specifically on how to disclose fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider as required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi).</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>In the December Proposal, the Bureau proposed additional clarification on other types of recipient institution fees that are, or are not, specifically related to a remittance transfer. For organizational purposes, the December Proposal divided comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii into new proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii through -1.v. Specifically, proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii would have contrasted the fees and taxes required to be disclosed by § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) and the fees and taxes required to be disclosed by § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). Proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.iii would have revised the reference to taxes imposed by a foreign government to taxes imposed by a foreign country's central government, and the proposed commentary would have built on the existing guidance regarding applicable recipient institution fees to clarify that account fees are not specifically related to a remittance transfer if such fees are merely assessed based on general account activity and not for receiving transfers. Proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.iv additionally would have explained that a fee that specifically relates to a remittance transfer may be structured on a flat per-transaction basis, or may be conditioned on other factors (such as account status or the quantity of remittance transfers received) in addition to on the remittance transfer itself. Proposed 31(b)(1)-1.v would have provided that the terms used to describe the fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider in § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) and imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) must differentiate between such fees and taxes.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>Insofar as the Bureau is eliminating the requirement to disclose non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, the Bureau is not adopting the proposed revisions to comments 31(b)(1)-1.ii. Instead, applicable examples concerning the types of fees related to a remittance transfer that must be disclosed have been moved to the commentary to § 1005.30(h), as discussed above. See comment 30(h)-1. The Bureau is, however, modifying certain aspects of the remaining commentary in light of the new definitions and the elimination of the requirement to disclose taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider. In comment 31(b)(1)-1.i of the 2013 Final Rule, the reference to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) is removed to focus on the scope of fees imposed or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by the provider that are required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii). The Bureau is also revising comments 31(b)(1)-1.ii, 31(b)(1)-2, and 31(b)(1)-3 of the 2013 Final Rule commentary consistent with new scope of the required disclosures and the movement of certain commentary to 30(h). In addition, the 2013 Final Rule divides existing commentary in 31(b)(1)-1.ii to create a new comment 31(b)(1)-1.iii for clarity.</analysisParagraph>

    <title>31(b)(1)(v) Transfer Amount</title>
    <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(b)(1)(v) of the 2012 Final Rule requires remittance transfer providers to disclose the transfer amount in the currency in which the funds will be received by the designated recipient. Under § 1005.31(b)(1)(v) of the 2012 Final Rule, providers are required to disclose the transfer amount only if applicable fees and taxes are imposed by persons other than the provider under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), in order to demonstrate to the sender how such fees reduce the amount received by the designated recipient. Insofar as § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) in the 2013 Final Rule will now only require disclosure of covered third-party fees, the Bureau has made conforming changes to the appropriate reference in Start Printed Page 30670§ 1005.31(b)(1)(v) to clarify that the section implicates covered third-party fees only rather than all fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider.</analysisParagraph>

    <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) of the 2012 Final Rule requires remittance transfer providers to disclose any fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, in the currency in which the funds will be received by the designated recipient. As discussed above, the Bureau is refining the 2012 Final Rule with respect to the disclosure of certain recipient institution fees and foreign taxes. The rationale for these changes is discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
    <title>Disclosure of Recipient Institution Fees</title>
    <analysisParagraph>Since the Board first proposed to amend Regulation E to implement the Dodd-Frank Act's remittance transfer provisions, industry participants and representatives have argued that particularly for remittance transfers that take place over an open network, the requirement to disclose third-party fees is unduly burdensome, if not impossible, given the potential number of institutions involved in any one transfer and the fact that remittance transfer providers typically have no direct relationships with recipient institutions. In issuing the February Final Rule, the Bureau recognized the challenges for providers in disclosing fees imposed by third parties, but determined that the disclosure of third-party fees would provide senders with greater transparency regarding the cost of a remittance transfer consistent with the purposes of the EFTA.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>Consequently, § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) of the 2012 Final Rule required providers to disclose fees imposed by persons other than the provider (including fees imposed by the designated recipient's institution) and required that such fees be taken into account when calculating the disclosure of the amount to be received under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii). In view of Congress' recognition that these determinations would be difficult in the context of open network transactions by financial institutions, see EFTA section 919(a)(4), § 1005.32(a) permitted insured institutions to estimate the amounts required to be disclosed pursuant to §§ 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) and (vii) for an interim period when such transfers are sent from a sender's account with the institution and the remittance transfer cannot determine the exact amounts for reasons beyond its control.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>As noted above, after the Bureau published the February Final Rule, industry participants and representatives continued to express concern through comment letters and other fora that, where a designated recipient's institution charges the recipient fees for receiving a transfer in an account, the remittance transfer provider would not reasonably know, or be able to estimate, the amount of fees that might apply because fees might vary based on agreements between the recipient and the recipient institution. Relatedly, industry participants and representatives requested clarification on whether and how to disclose recipient institution fees that can vary based on the recipient's status with the institution, the account type, the quantity of transfers received, or other variables that are not easily knowable by the sender or the provider.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>In response to these concerns, in the December Proposal, the Bureau proposed to provide clarification relating to which recipient institution fees remittance transfer providers were required to disclose and additional flexibility and guidance on how recipient institution fees could be disclosed. Proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii would have provided additional examples to distinguish between fees that are specifically related to the remittance transfer and therefore required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), including fees that are imposed by a recipient's institution for receiving a wire transfer, and other types of recipient institution fees that are not specifically related to a remittance transfer, such as a monthly maintenance fee, and therefore not required to be disclosed. For example, the proposed comment would have noted that fees that specifically relate to a remittance transfer may be structured on a flat per-transaction basis, or may be conditioned on other factors (such as account status or the quantity of remittance transfers received) in addition to the remittance transfer itself. Moreover, similar to the treatment of taxes imposed by a person other than the remittance transfer provider under the 2012 Final Rule, the Bureau proposed to add comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-4 to clarify that a provider could rely on a sender's representation regarding variables that affect the amount of fees imposed by the recipient's institution for receiving a transfer in an account where the provider did not have specific knowledge regarding such variables.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>Additionally, the December Proposal proposed to allow all remittance transfer providers, not just insured institutions covered by the temporary exception, the flexibility to estimate on a permanent basis certain fees imposed by a designated recipient's institution for receiving a transfer into an account. Specially, where a provider did not have specific knowledge regarding variables that affect the amount of fees imposed by a designated recipient's institution for receiving a transfer in an account, proposed § 1005.32(b)(4)(i) would have permitted a provider to disclose the highest possible recipient institution fees that could be imposed on the remittance transfer with respect to any unknown variable, as determined based on either the recipient institution's fee schedules or information ascertained from prior transfers to that same institution.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>The December Proposal additionally provided in proposed § 1005.32(b)(4)(ii) and its accompanying commentary that, if the remittance transfer provider could not obtain such fee schedules or did not have such information, the provider could rely on other reasonable sources of information, including fee schedules published by competitor institutions, surveys of financial institution fees, or information provided by the recipient institution's regulator or central bank as long as the provider disclosed the highest fees identified through the relied-upon source. The Bureau sought comment on all aspects of this proposal.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>Although most industry commenters stated that they supported the Bureau's efforts to provide additional flexibility to remittance transfer providers to determine applicable recipient institution fees, many industry commenters argued that the December Proposal would not significantly reduce the burden of disclosing recipient institution fees that are not already known. Describing providers' efforts to come into compliance with the 2012 Final Rule, industry commenters stated that efforts to obtain fee information had largely been hampered by the difficulty of obtaining information from recipient institutions with whom providers had no direct relationship, particularly in cases in which fees were governed by contracts between recipient institutions and recipients, i.e., those institutions' customers. In additional outreach by the Bureau, one large bank provider and correspondent reported that it had attempted to survey recipient institutions with which it had regular contact, but that the vast majority of institutions had either not provided the requested fee information or failed to respond altogether. In comment letters, as well as outreach both before and after the publication of the December Proposal, industry participants stated that they had difficulty explaining to foreign institutions what was being requested and why the foreign institutions should provide that information. Industry participants further stated that recipient institutions declined to provide the requested fee information, citing proprietary, competitive, and privacy concerns associated with releasing information about their fee schedules and their contractual relationships with their customers.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>Some industry participants stated that as a result of the difficulty in obtaining fee information from individual institutions, even with the flexibility that the December Proposal would have allowed, they anticipated that the challenges associated with obtaining fee schedules or conducting fee surveys might force them to limit services to countries where fee information was more readily obtainable or where the transfer volume was significant enough to warrant additional efforts to obtain fee information. Though the pertinent comment letters focused on the December Proposal, the arguments echoed concerns that industry participants had previously expressed prior to the 2012 Final Rule with regard to any requirement to disclose fees imposed by persons other than the remittance transfer provider. Industry commenters further opined more generally, as they had prior to the 2012 Final Rule, that a significant number of providers might choose to exit the market altogether, even if the Bureau were to adopt the December Proposal, due to the difficulty of disclosing recipient institution fees.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>In addition, several industry commenters stated that compared to the 2012 Final Rule, the proposed estimation methodologies would not improve and instead could diminish the quality of the disclosures received by senders or senders' ability to comparison shop. With respect to the Bureau's proposal to add commentary clarifying that remittance transfer providers could rely in certain circumstances on senders' representations regarding the variables that affect the amount of fees to be imposed by a recipient's financial institution (see proposed § 1005.32(b)(4)), several industry commenters argued that if the sender knew the fees that applied to the recipient's account, then it is likely the sender was getting such information from the recipient, and in such cases the disclosure of recipient institution fees would not provide additional transparency to the sender. By contrast, to the extent that the sender had not received information on the variables that affect fees from the designated recipient, industry commenters argued that relying on a sender's representation would be unlikely to provide reliable information. Industry commenters repeated industry's longstanding assertion that recipients are in the best position to know what fees their institutions impose on receiving transfers, and suggested that the Bureau reconsider its decision to mandate disclosure of such fees or provide a database of fees upon which providers could rely.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters also expressed concern with respect to the Bureau's proposal to allow remittance transfer providers to disclose an estimate of the highest possible recipient institution fee that could be imposed on the remittance transfer with respect to any unknown variable (see proposed § 1005.32(b)(4)), as determined based on either fee schedules made available by the recipient institution or information ascertained from prior transfers to the same recipient institution. Commenters stated that if each provider employed its own methodology based on its own research, the highest possible fee estimates would vary, sometimes widely, across institutions. Commenters argued that this could cause consumer confusion and undermine comparison shopping, as senders would have little insight into which estimation model was accurate. Although certain limited estimation is permitted under the 2012 Final Rule for some transfers sent by insured institutions, see § 1005.32(a) and (b), commenters argued that using the additional estimation methodologies permitted under the December Proposal would lead to greater degrees of inaccuracy because of the requirement to disclose the highest estimate possible with respect to certain recipient institution fees where such fees might be unlikely apply. Furthermore, the proposed estimation methodology would have differed from the bases for estimates described in existing § 1005.32(c), which permit a provider to base an estimate on an approach not listed in subpart B of Regulation E so long as the designated recipient receives the same, or greater, amount of funds than the provider disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii).</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>Commenters also suggested that under either the 2012 Final Rule or the December Proposal, smaller institutions would be at a disadvantage, compared to their larger competitors, because they would have fewer resources to collect and maintain extensive data sets regarding account fees for every location to which they did or could send a remittance transfer. Several industry commenters further opined that remittance transfer providers that could provide lower estimates could have a competitive advantage over providers that provided higher (but potentially more accurate) estimates because the providers with lower estimates would appear to be providing designated recipients with more funds, even though the actual fee imposed by the recipient institution for the same designated recipient should generally be the same for transfers sent by the same sender to the same recipient institution.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>Finally, some industry commenters argued there was a significant risk that if the highest possible fee a recipient institution could impose on receiving a remittance transfer was disclosed, a sender might unnecessarily overfund a remittance transfer to ensure that the designated recipient received a certain amount. For example, a commenter explained, that a sender might want to send a remittance transfer to a merchant to pay for a purchase. The merchant, per its agreement with the receiving institution, might be charged an incoming wire transfer fee. Although the merchant would not expect the sender to pay this fee, as the merchant had incorporated such cost into its overhead, the sender might believe that he or she is responsible for covering this fee and might increase the amount transferred by the amount of the disclosed fee.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>Because of the limitations they perceived with estimates disclosed under the Bureau's methodology described in the December Proposal, the majority of industry commenters requested that the Bureau eliminate the required disclosure of recipient institution fees altogether. Several of these industry commenters argued, as commenters had argued as part of the 2012 rulemakings, that section 1073 of the Dodd-Frank Act did not expressly require disclosure of recipient institution fees and urged the Bureau to eliminate the required disclosure of recipient institution fees. A few commenters went further and suggested that the Bureau should eliminate the required disclosure of intermediary fees as well. Alternatively, industry commenters suggested that the Bureau delay the implementation date for the disclosure of recipient institution fees until resources for ascertaining such fees could be developed, although such commenters did not indicate that such resources were being developed or that they would soon be available.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters were divided in their reactions to the December Proposal's provisions regarding the disclosure of recipient institution fees. Although some consumer group commenters favored the Bureau's approach in providing increased flexibility and guidance with respect to the disclosure of recipient institution fees, other consumer group commenters believed that the methods of estimation proposed by the Bureau would prove to be problematic for senders and suggested either that the allowance for such estimation be made temporary or that the required disclosure of recipient institution fees be eliminated.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>Among consumer group commenters who favored the disclosure of recipient institution fees, some opined that recipient institution fee information could become readily available given current technology, and they encouraged the Bureau to, at the very least, make any additional estimate provisions temporary in nature. This would, these commenters argued, provide strong incentives to industry to create databases with the necessary information for compliance. In addition, one comment letter argued that permitting “estimated” price disclosures essentially permits a continuation of the status quo that Congress intended to change by adopting section 1073 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The commenter further suggested that although a permanent exemption from any disclosure requirements would be premature, a delay in requiring disclosure of recipient institution fees may be needed to provide enough time and the proper incentives for some providers to update their information systems in order to capture this information.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>By contrast, other consumer group commenters maintained that it was appropriate to eliminate the obligation to disclose recipient institution fees given the difficulty remittance transfer providers (or their partners) face in determining these fees. These commenters argued that, given the inaccuracies inherent in estimating the applicable fees to be applied, senders would be better served by an alternative generic disclosure noting that recipient institutions may charge account fees, rather than requiring the specific disclosure of such fees.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>In light of information received through comment letters, additional outreach, and the Bureau's independent monitoring of efforts to implement the 2012 Final Rule, the Bureau believes that it is necessary and proper both to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and to facilitate compliance to exercise its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to eliminate the requirement to disclose recipient institution fees for transfers into an account, except where the recipient institution is acting as an agent of the provider.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>As stated in the February Final Rule, the Bureau believes that disclosures regarding the fees imposed by persons other than the remittance transfer provider can benefit senders by making them aware of the impact of these fees, helping to decide how much money to send, facilitating comparison shopping, and aiding in error resolution. As described in the February Final Rule, in recent years, a number of concerns with regard to the clarity and reliability of information provided to consumers sending remittance transfers have been identified. Congressional hearings prior to enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act focused on the need for standardized and reliable pre-payment disclosures, suggesting that disclosure of the amount of money to be received by the designated recipient is particularly critical. Research suggests that consumers place a high value on reliability to ensure that the promised amount is made available to recipients. See 77 FR 6199 (and sources cited therein).</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>Despite the public interest in the disclosure of recipient interest fees, however, the Bureau believes that requiring disclosure of such fees in cases in which the recipient institution is not an agent of the provider would at this time either require a substantial delay in implementation of the overall Dodd-Frank Act regime for remittance transfers or produce a significant contraction in access to remittance transfers, particularly for less popular corridors. The Bureau believes that both of these results would substantially harm consumers and undermine the broader purposes of the statutory scheme. Accordingly, the Bureau has constructed the exception to relieve the obligation to disclose recipient institution fees absent an agency relationship between the remittance transfer provider and the recipient institution.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that, in practice, this adjustment of the 2012 Final Rule will affect a minority of remittance transfers. While information on the volume of open-network transfers is limited, the Bureau believes that closed network transfers sent through agents—i.e., transfers for which remittance transfer providers must continue to disclose all third-party fees in accordance with the 2012 Final Rule—account for the majority of remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>For the minority of transfers where the exception applies because there is no agency relationship between the remittance transfer provider and the recipient institution, the Bureau has concluded that finalizing the proposed exception in § 1005.32(b)(4) (which would have permitted estimates in certain circumstances) would have significant risks and disadvantages to senders of remittance transfers. First, despite the greater flexibility that the December Proposal would have provided concerning estimation methodologies, the Bureau is concerned that many remittance transfer providers still would have curtailed services particularly outside of heavily used corridors. Second, the Bureau is concerned that the resulting estimates would have varied so widely that their use to consumers in calibrating transfer amounts and comparison shopping would have been limited.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that given current limitations, it is appropriate to require use of a more generic disclaimer to warn consumers where recipient institution fees may apply and to change the model forms in a way that will reduce the risk of consumer confusion in attempting to make comparisons where estimates are provided. The Bureau also believes that it is important to encourage estimates and increasingly reliable methodologies over time, and will continue dialogue with interested stakeholders about how best to make progress toward this goal.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>The Bureau's conclusion rests in large part on its understanding of the open network systems for sending remittance transfers. As described above, these networks allow remittance transfer providers to send to accounts at banks worldwide. However, providers have limited authority or ability to monitor or control the recipient institutions in such networks. Although the Bureau had expected that industry's implementation efforts would result in the development of the compilation of reliable and current information concerning fees imposed by many recipient institutions for most corridors, the process has been slower and harder than expected and the lack of comprehensive information could lead providers to limit their offerings. Given the current environment, the Bureau believes that estimating, or in some cases, determining the actual recipient institution fees for transfers to accounts consistent with the 2012 Final Rule would be difficult or impracticable given the myriad institutions to which such remittance transfers may be sent and the myriad fee schedules that may apply across these institutions.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>Even under the Bureau's proposal to provide additional flexibility for remittance transfer providers in estimating certain recipient institution Start Printed Page 30673fees for transfers to accounts, the comment letters and the Bureau's outreach suggest that the burden of obtaining and maintaining applicable fee information sufficient to provide the permitted estimates in all cases would still be substantial. The Bureau is concerned that even if it adopted the December Proposal, the requirements to disclose recipient institution fees might cause a number of providers to raise their prices, significantly reduce their offerings, or exit the market due to the requirements related to the disclosure of recipient institution fees. If any price increase were similar to the size of a recipient institution fee, that alone might offset the benefit of improved information about the size of such fees. Furthermore, as the Bureau stated in the December Proposal, the Bureau believes that the loss of market participants would be detrimental to senders by decreasing market competition and the convenient availability of remittance transfer services.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>Moreover, the Bureau is concerned that the estimate methodologies proposed in the December Proposal would have produced disclosures that varied so widely that their use to senders in calibrating transfer amounts and comparison shopping would have been limited. In many cases, the December Proposal would have required the remittance transfer provider to over-estimate recipient institution fees, by disclosing the highest possible fee that could be imposed on the remittance transfer with respect to any unknown variable. To the extent providers used differing methodologies upon which to base their estimates, the disclosed fees could vary significantly across institutions, making it difficult for senders to decide how much money to transmit.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>In addition, because these fees would be separately disclosed and included within the total to recipient on the disclosure forms, differences in amounts disclosed among remittance transfer providers could lead senders to mistakenly focus on discrepancies within these fees when comparison shopping, even though the actual fee would likely be the same regardless of the provider so long as the sender transmitted the same amount to the same designated recipient at the same institution using the same transfer method. While the Bureau believes that it is important to encourage estimates and increasingly reliable methodologies over time, the Bureau has concluded that given current limitations it is appropriate to require use of a more generic disclaimer to alert senders where recipient institution fees may apply and to change the model forms in a way that will reduce the risk of consumer confusion in attempting to make comparisons where estimates are provided. By providing the disclaimer, senders themselves can investigate such fees. In addition, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii), providers may be incentivized to seek such information to better compete with providers providing more detailed price information. The Bureau believes this amendment to the disclosure requirements will best preserve senders' access to competitive remittance transfer markets, while facilitating continued information-gathering about such fees both by senders and providers.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>Alternatively, the Bureau considered further delaying implementation of the section 1073 protections, to allow remittance transfer providers to continue to seek more reliable fee information in order to reduce implementation burdens and make fee-related disclosures more accurate and thus more useful for senders. However, the Bureau believes that it is critical to provide senders timely access to the important new consumer protection benefits of the 2012 Final Rule including rights to cancellation and error resolution.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, the Bureau has tailored its amendments to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), and as discussed below, § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii), to focus on the third-party fees that the Bureau believes are most difficult for remittance transfer providers to disclose. Based on the Bureau's outreach, it appears that providers sending transfers through open network systems have had considerably more success in obtaining information needed to estimate or disclose accurately fees imposed by intermediary institutions, as compared to recipient institutions that maintain ongoing customer relationships with individual designated recipients. Some providers (or business partners) have changed or contemplated changing the methods they use to send transfers between bank accounts, in order to avoid the imposition of any intermediary fees. In addition, some providers have worked with correspondents to understand such intermediary fees. Thus, the Bureau is not eliminating the requirement to disclose pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) intermediary bank fees or to include such amount in the calculation of the amount required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii).</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>Similarly, although the Bureau is making an adjustment for recipient institution fees that it believes industry cannot reasonably disclose, it is not adjusting the required disclosures for transfers that a recipient picks up at a paying agent. As noted above, the additional guidance included in the December Proposal targeted situations in which providers did not have specific knowledge regarding variables that affect the amount imposed by the recipient's institution for receiving a transfer in an account. By contrast, where the designated recipient's institution is an agent of the remittance transfer provider, the Bureau believes the provider should have access to or be able to contract concerning the disclosure of any fees imposed by such institution. Consequently, the Bureau is maintaining the provider's obligation under the 2012 Final Rule to disclose a designated recipient institution's fees where such recipient institution is acting as an agent of the provider in the remittance transfer. Through a provider's contractual arrangements with its agents, the Bureau believes that such information should be readily available to or obtainable by a provider or that the provider can control such fees, based on the terms of the contract between the provider and such agent.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>For similar reasons, the Bureau is maintaining the requirement to disclose fees assessed for remittance transfers to credit cards, prepaid cards, or virtual accounts held by an Internet-based or mobile phone company that is not a bank, credit union, or equivalent institution. See comment 30(h)-3. In the December Proposal, the Bureau did not specifically propose to allow estimation of these amounts. Although a few comment letters suggested that the proposed estimates exception should be expanded to cover more than depository institution accounts, such as general purpose reloadable (or prepaid) cards, mobile phones, or mobile or electronic wallets, no commenters suggested that obtaining this information would be as burdensome as the disclosure of depository institution fees. Indeed, upon further outreach, industry participants largely confirmed that currently the majority of such transactions currently take place within a single network whereby such fees are a matter of contract. The Bureau believes that the systems for offering such transfers are still nascent and that currently most of these transfers are provided through systems in which remittance transfer providers have contractual arrangements with the recipient institutions, or the providers and the recipient institutions operate within one single network. The Bureau further believes that these arrangements Start Printed Page 30674will likely permit providers to exercise some control over, or learn about, fees charged by recipient institutions. As these systems grow, the Bureau expects that providers, and any associated networks, can design systems so that any associated fees with respect to such transfers are transparent to providers and senders alike.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe that the same sort of evolution can happen as quickly or easily in existing open network systems, and in particular for the interbank wire transfer system. These systems use communication and settlement protocols that have been developed over decades (or longer) and assume that participating institutions will exercise little control over each other.[6] Furthermore, these systems depend on the participation of many foreign entities that have no duty or incentive to comply with subpart B of Regulation E. Consequently, for purposes of determining the fees imposed on the remittance transfer by the designated recipient's institution for receiving a remittance transfer into an account under § 1005.30(h)(2), the Bureau includes transfers into an asset account, regardless of whether or not it is a consumer asset account, established for any purpose and held by a bank, savings association, credit union, or equivalent institution. See comment 30(h)-3. The Bureau believes that these institutions are likely subject to legacy systems that cannot easily be modified to capture fee information.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>In light of these conclusions, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau is exercising its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to maintain in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) the remittance transfer provider's obligation to disclose covered third-party fees and that such fees be included in the amount disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), discussed further below. The Bureau believes that providing a total to recipient that reflects the impact of such fees, and separately disclosing these fees, will provide senders with a greater transparency regarding the cost of a remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>Insofar as the Bureau is eliminating the required disclosure of non-covered third-party fees, the Bureau is also not adopting the suggestion of several industry and consumer group commenters that to facilitate compliance, the Bureau help develop and maintain a database of recipient institution fees that could be accessed by remittance transfer providers. The Bureau continues to believe that because providers are engaged in the business of sending remittance transfers and likely will develop relationships with recipient institutions over time, providers are in a better position than the Bureau is to determine applicable fee information. The Bureau will continue to monitor implementation of this rule and market developments, including whether better information about recipient institution fees becomes more readily available over time. The Bureau will also engage in stakeholder dialogue about methods to encourage improvements in communications methodologies and data gathering so as to promote the provision of increasingly accurate estimates and disclosures of actual fees over time.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
    <title>Disclosure of Foreign Taxes</title>
    <analysisParagraph>Commenters' arguments regarding the disclosure of foreign taxes have largely paralleled their arguments regarding the disclosure of recipient institution fees. Notably, since the Board's proposal, industry has argued that the requirement to disclose foreign taxes is unduly burdensome given the number of jurisdictions that may impose taxes and the challenges of determining whether or how various tax exceptions or exclusions may apply. Although the Bureau recognized the challenges for remittance transfer providers in disclosing foreign taxes, the Bureau also believed that this disclosure would provide senders with greater transparency regarding the cost of a remittance transfer, which the Bureau believed was consistent with the purposes of the EFTA. Consequently, § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) of the 2012 Final Rule generally would have required that providers disclose foreign taxes and take such taxes into account when calculating the disclosure of the amount to be received under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii). This disclosure of taxes would have included foreign taxes imposed by a country's central government, as well as taxes imposed by regional, provincial, state, or other local governments.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>After the Bureau published the 2012 Final Rule, industry continued to express concern about the ability of remittance transfer providers to disclose these foreign taxes in two respects. First, industry argued that it is significantly more burdensome to research and disclose subnational taxes than to research and disclose only foreign taxes imposed by a country's central government, with little commensurate benefit to consumers. Second, industry suggested that the existing guidance on the disclosure of foreign taxes is insufficient where variables that influence the applicability of foreign taxes are not easily knowable by the sender or the provider.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>In light of these comments, in its December Proposal, the Bureau proposed two revisions to the 2012 Final Rule regarding foreign tax disclosures. First, the proposal would have revised § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) to state that only foreign taxes imposed by a country's central government on the remittance transfer need to be disclosed. Proposed comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-3 would have further clarified that regional, provincial, state, or other local foreign taxes do not need to be disclosed, although the remittance transfer provider could choose to disclose them. In the event that the subnational taxes were not disclosed, the proposal would have required that a provider state that a disclosure is “Estimated.” Consistent with this amendment, regional, provincial, state, or other local foreign taxes would not have needed to be taken into account when calculating the disclosure of the amount to be received under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii).</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>Second, the December Proposal also would have provided additional flexibility regarding the determination of foreign taxes imposed by a country's central government. Under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), if a remittance transfer provider did not have specific knowledge regarding variables that affect the amount of these taxes imposed by a person other than the provider, the provider could disclose the highest possible tax that could be imposed on the remittance transfer with respect to any unknown variable. Where a provider relied on this estimation method, the proposal would have required that a provider state that related disclosures are “Estimated.”</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>The Bureau sought comment on both aspects of these proposed changes, including whether the proposed revisions would facilitate compliance and how the revisions would impact senders. Similar to comments about the proposed revisions to the disclosure of recipient institution fees, the Bureau received numerous comments from industry and consumer groups on its proposed elimination of the subnational tax disclosure and also its proposed methods for the estimation of taxes imposed by a foreign country's central government.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>With respect to the proposed change related to the elimination of the requirement to disclose subnational taxes and to include such taxes in the calculation of the amount to be received, there was uniform support from industry commenters. Nearly all industry commenters expressed concern that it was infeasible to attempt to research all potential jurisdictions that might impose a subnational tax. Further, industry commenters noted that there would be an ongoing and potentially significant cost required to maintain information related to all subnational tax laws throughout the world given the number of potential jurisdictions that could impose a tax. Additionally, in terms of the feasibility of the disclosure of subnational taxes, one money transmitter also stated that it would be difficult for it to disclose subnational taxes given that its customers were not required, when sending a transfer, to specify a sub-region within a country where the transfer would be picked up.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>Another money transmitter also stated that, in its experience, it believed that subnational taxes were rare. Although this commenter did not cite any examples of tax practice in specific jurisdictions, this commenter argued that many localities wanted to encourage the inflow of transfers, and therefore, would be unlikely to impose subnational taxes. This commenter and others stated that the cost to determine, in every case, whether subnational taxes applied, a cost that might be passed on to all senders, would outweigh the benefits given that it appeared that such taxes rarely applied in practice.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>In contrast to the uniform support by industry commenters for the elimination of the requirement to disclose subnational taxes, consumer group commenters were divided regarding their views about the proposed elimination of the requirement to disclose subnational taxes. Some consumer group commenters opposed the proposed change and stated that full disclosure of the exact amount of foreign taxes was critical in order for senders to be aware of exactly how much money would be received. They stated that elimination of the requirement to disclose subnational taxes would harm senders because they would not know with certainty how much money would ultimately be received. Other consumer group commenters, however, stated that the burden of researching and disclosing subnational taxes outweighed the relative benefit to senders. These consumer group commenters noted that some remittance transfer providers could withdraw from the market or increase prices if required to research and disclose subnational taxes.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>With respect to the Bureau's proposal to allow remittance transfer providers increased flexibility to estimate the taxes imposed by a country's central government, many industry commenters expressed concern that the December Proposal did not sufficiently ease the burden of researching foreign taxes. These industry commenters raised several concerns with respect to the proposed estimated disclosure of taxes imposed by a foreign country's central government. Some industry participants commented that they did not have the capability to research the relevant tax laws in the first place because they did not have foreign contacts, or, alternatively, that they did not have the resources to expend to determine the applicable foreign tax laws. Thus, they asserted that an ability to estimate would not facilitate compliance since such estimation would require an underlying knowledge of the foreign tax laws.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters, particularly smaller banks and credit unions, also noted that remittance transfer providers were reluctant to rely on information from third-party service providers (such as larger correspondent institutions) because they would have no means to verify the accuracy of the information provided by the third-parties. Further, even where the tax information was accurate, some industry commenters stated that there could be a high cost associated with relying on a third-party provider to obtain that foreign tax information. Similar to industry comments about the disclosure of subnational taxes, commenters stated that these costs not only included the upfront costs of acquiring the tax information but also ongoing costs required to maintain and update tax information. For example, commenters expressed concern that, even if a provider (or a third-party selling the tax information) determined that a particular country did not tax remittance transfers, the provider would need to continue to monitor that country's tax law to know whether any new tax laws were enacted in the future.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters (as well as some consumer group commenters) stated that some of the burden resulting from the disclosure of foreign taxes imposed by a country's central government could be solved if the Bureau itself developed a tax database that was made available to remittance transfer providers. Industry commenters noted that a Bureau-provided database would eliminate the cost and potential inaccuracy that could result from each provider's individual attempts to determine the applicable foreign taxes.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>Along similar lines, the Bureau learned through outreach that at least one trade association is developing a database containing information about foreign taxes imposed on remittance transfers by a country's central government. The trade association informed the Bureau that, by working with a third-party, it thought it could eventually determine the relevant tax laws for most countries. The trade association, however, stated that there were several challenges associated with determining and disclosing the applicable tax under the proposed estimation method. According to the trade association and other commenters, one concern was that many foreign taxes have exceptions and exclusions that are not imposed uniformly on all transfers. The trade association noted that, even if a database listed applicable tax laws, it might be difficult for remittance transfer providers, particularly smaller providers, to apply these exceptions and incorporate the exceptions into computer programs or onto forms to arrive at an accurate tax disclosure. Some industry commenters also noted that, if a provider did not apply an exception, that provider might appear to be imposing a higher tax than another provider that applied the exception, even if the tax is the same. Thus, these commenters stated that a sender might misidentify the cheapest provider.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>Relatedly, several other industry commenters expressed concern that a tax law might be misinterpreted or misunderstood by the remittance transfer provider because of the challenges of interpreting foreign laws. As a result, several industry commenters and a trade association stated that the Bureau should provide a safe harbor for providers that use some reasonable processes to acquire the tax information. Other commenters stated that they would favor a safe harbor whereby, if the provider relied on some reasonable source of information in obtaining tax information, that provider would not be liable if the disclosed tax was incorrect.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters also echoed similar comments to those made with respect to the December Proposal's provisions regarding the recipient institution fee disclosures, stating that the estimated tax disclosure would be of limited benefit to senders because they believed that in many instances the same tax likely would apply to all transfers to a particular country. As a result, a disclosure of the foreign tax would not improve a sender's ability to comparison shop among remittance transfer providers. In addition, other commenters noted that because the Bureau's proposed estimation method required a disclosure of the highest possible foreign tax that could be imposed with respect to any unknown variable, a sender might transfer more money than was required to compensate for the high estimated tax that the sender believed would be deducted. The commenters noted, for example, that if a sender was transferring funds to a foreign merchant, the higher disclosed tax could harm the sender who inadvertently provided more money than was necessary to pay for a good or service.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>In contrast to industry commenters and as with respect to the Bureau's proposal to eliminate the requirement to disclose subnational taxes, consumer groups were divided with respect to their comments about the proposed change to allow estimation to be used in the determination of the foreign country tax disclosure. Some consumer groups stated that the estimation of foreign taxes would harm senders because they would not know exactly how much money would be received. In contrast, other consumer groups supported the Bureau's proposed estimation method for those taxes imposed by a country's central government. These consumer groups stated that the Bureau's proposed estimation method would facilitate compliance, and thereby encourage providers to stay in the market or prevent providers from increasing prices.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>Similar to its reasoning with respect to the elimination of the requirement to disclose certain recipient institution fees, as a result of comments received, additional outreach, and the Bureau's independent monitoring of efforts to implement the 2012 Final Rule, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper both to further the purposes of the EFTA and to facilitate compliance to exercise its exception authority under EFTA section 904(c) to eliminate the requirement that remittance transfer providers include taxes collected by a person other than the provider—including both subnational taxes and taxes imposed by a foreign country's central government, in the calculation of the amount to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii). Consistent with this revision, the Bureau is also eliminating the requirement to disclose taxes imposed by a person other than the remittance transfer provider under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) since such taxes are no longer necessary to clarify the calculation of the amount to be received under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii). Under the 2013 Final Rule, a provider continues to be required to disclose any taxes collected by the provider, as described under § 1005.31(b)(ii), but providers are no longer required to disclose taxes collected by other persons.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>As stated in the February Final Rule, the Bureau believes that disclosures regarding the taxes collected by a person other than the remittance transfer provider can benefit senders by making them aware of the impact of these taxes on the total amount transferred, deciding how much money to transfer, facilitating comparison shopping, and aiding in error resolution. Yet, while this foreign tax information is important for consumers, the Bureau is concerned that requiring disclosure of taxes collected by a person other than the provider could at this time produce increased costs for all transactions or result in a significant contraction in access to remittance transfers, particularly for less popular corridors. Similar to its decision about eliminating the requirement to disclose certain recipient institution fees, the Bureau believes that both of these results would substantially harm consumers and undermine the broader purposes of the statutory scheme. Accordingly, the Bureau has concluded that in the current environment, this amendment to the tax disclosure requirements will best preserve access to competitive prices for remittance transfers for a wide range of countries.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>As with fees, one key factor in the Bureau's decision was a concern that the required tax disclosure might limit the availability of remittance services to certain countries or result in an increased cost for many transfers. With respect to cost increases, under the 2012 Final Rule and the December Proposal, most remittance transfer providers would have needed to conduct research to determine (or purchase information regarding) the relevant foreign tax laws, potentially for many countries. These providers would also need to expend resources to update this information on a regular basis. Although one industry association has been undertaken to develop a database of applicable central government taxes, that association acknowledged several challenges both in developing the database and with how individual providers would make use of the data contained in it. For example, validation and continuous updating of the information collected remains a substantial concern. As described above, the Bureau is concerned that many providers would pass the costs associated with these efforts on to senders in the form of increased prices that would affect remittance transfers across the board, even to countries in which no such taxes are actually imposed. The Bureau also remains concerned that the cost of maintaining the required tax information could cause providers to exit the market, or limit their offerings—even if the requirement was limited to taxes imposed by a foreign country's central government. Some providers, for example, might curtail their services and limit transfers only to the highest traffic corridors in order to minimize their necessary foreign tax law research. Because some providers might restrict their services to certain corridors with less volume, a sender might have limited ability to send transfers to those regions.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>As a result, while the Bureau generally believes that senders can benefit from transparency regarding the foreign tax disclosure, in the present market, the cost of obtaining the necessary tax information may exceed the benefit of this information to many senders. As with recipient institution fees, the Bureau also recognizes that in many instances the benefit of the disclosure may be minimized because the actual foreign tax imposed is likely to be uniform across all remittance transfers to a particular person in a particular country (and, therefore, the same tax would apply).[7]</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>In addition, as with the estimation of recipient institution fees, the disclosure of the highest tax estimates based on any unknown variable, as required in the December Proposal, could result in consumer confusion where providers disclosed different tax estimates. Even if third-party providers developed common databases of information, there is still a risk of inconsistent disclosures depending on providers' knowledge of potentially relevant variables, practices, and interpretations of foreign tax law. The Bureau believes that using the general disclaimer and moving any voluntarily provided estimates or actual numbers lower on the form will help to reduce the risk that senders mistakenly choose providers based on discrepancies in tax estimates. Further, rather than adopting a systematic rule that tends to overestimate tax rates, the Bureau believes that senders may prefer to apply different approaches to different types of transfers, for instance by being more conservative about the risk of overfunding a transfer to a business as compared to a family member.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also does not believe that it is appropriate or feasible to create a safe harbor for remittance transfer providers that rely on a third-party database or some other third-party source for tax information. At this time, the Bureau is not aware of any data source whose accuracy it can guarantee, absent extensive monitoring. The Bureau is not currently positioned to evaluate the accuracy of each database that might be created nor can it determine whether providers are reasonably researching, interpreting, or applying the applicable foreign tax laws. Similarly, the Bureau does not believe that currently it is positioned to create a database itself. In addition, even if a database existed, as noted above, it would still be necessary to determine how the particular tax laws and exceptions or exclusions applied, and the Bureau believes that providers are better positioned to learn over time how foreign tax laws apply to individual transfers.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>Overall, given the current burden of researching the foreign taxes and the potential risks of sender confusion, increased cost, and reduced transfer services, the Bureau believes that the best result at this time is to eliminate the obligation to disclose taxes collected by parties other than the remittance transfer provider and to eliminate the requirement to include this amount in the calculation of the amount to be received by the designated recipient. The Bureau, however, notes that its decision is based on the current feasibility and cost associated with determining or estimating such taxes imposed on a remittance transfer, as well as the potential impact on market structure and pricing practices. The Bureau intends to monitor whether the development and availability of information regarding taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the provider becomes more feasible in the future. The Bureau will also engage in stakeholder dialogue about methods to encourage improvements in communications methodologies and data gathering so as to promote the provision of increasingly accurate estimates and disclosures of foreign taxes over time.</analysisParagraph>

    <title>Conforming Changes to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi)</title>
    <analysisParagraph>In light of the changes the Bureau is making with respect to the disclosure of non-covered third-party fees and foreign taxes, § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) in the 2013 Final Rule requires only the disclosure of covered third-party fees. The 2013 Final Rule also makes conforming edits to comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-1 to reflect that the disclosure of covered third-party fees must be made in the currency in which the funds will be received by the designated recipient. While the revised § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) provides that only covered third-party fees be disclosed under this subsection, as discussed below, under § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) a remittance transfer provider would remain free to disclose separately any non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected by a person other than the provider of which it is aware, to the extent consistent with the parameters of that section.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
       <analysisSection>
    <title>31(b)(1)(vii) Amount Received</title>
    <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) of the 2012 Final Rule implements EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(i) by requiring that a remittance transfer provider disclose to the sender the amount that will be received by the designated recipient, in the currency in which the funds will be received. As adopted by the 2012 Final Rule, this disclosure must reflect all charges that would affect the amount to be received including any recipient institution fees and taxes imposed by a person other than the provider. As stated above, the Bureau is exercising its exception authority under EFTA section 904(c) to revise § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) to eliminate the requirement to include non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the provider in the calculation of the amount received, consistent with the narrowed scope of § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). Section 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) of the 2013 Final Rule thus provides that the disclosed amount must be disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be received, using the term “Total to Recipient” or a substantially similar term except that this amount shall not include any non-covered third party fee or tax collected by a person other than the provider, whether such fee or tax is disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii).</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>While § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) gives the provider the option to disclose non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, as discussed below, a provider cannot, in any circumstance, include these amounts in the amount disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii). The Bureau believes that eliminating the requirement to include non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider in the calculation of the disclosed amount to be received by the designated recipient is necessary and proper to facilitate compliance and further the purposes of the EFTA because the Bureau is concerned that requiring disclosure of such amounts within the amount disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) might hamper senders' ability to make informed comparisons across similar providers.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>The 2013 Final Rule also makes conforming edits to comment 31(b)(1)(vii) to clarify that the amount disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) must reflect the exchange rate, all fees imposed and all taxes collected on the remittance transfer by the provider, as well as any covered third-party fees as provided by § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). The Bureau recognizes that in some cases the amount disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) will not reflect the amount that the designated recipient will ultimately receive due to additional non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider.</analysisParagraph>

     <title>31(b)(1)(viii) Statements That Non-Covered Third-Party Fees or Taxes Collected on the Remittance Transfer by a Person Other Than the Provider May Apply</title>
     <analysisParagraph>In the December Proposal, the Bureau solicited comment on methods to reduce the burden of required disclosures of fees and taxes imposed on remittance transfers by persons other than the providers and alternative disclosures that could be provided. Several industry and consumer group commenters suggested that in place of requiring exact or estimated disclosures of recipient institution fees or foreign taxes, the Bureau could require a statement within the disclosure forms alerting senders that the total amount received may be reduced by recipient institution fees or foreign taxes. These commenters contended that such a disclosure would ensure that senders are aware of the potential for further reductions in the disclosed amount received, due to fees or taxes that are not disclosed, and would encourage senders and recipients to investigate the fees associated with a transfer to the recipient's financial institution, as compared to those associated with other mechanisms for sending a remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
     <analysisParagraph>Although the Bureau is eliminating the requirement to calculate and disclose non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider, the Bureau strongly believes that it is nonetheless important to inform senders when fees and taxes that are not disclosed may apply to the remittance transfer. Accordingly, to further the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes that it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to add § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii), which requires that a provider include, as applicable, a statement indicating that non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider may apply to the remittance transfer and result in the designated recipient receiving less than the amount disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii). Moreover, under this paragraph, a provider may, but is not required to, disclose any applicable non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider using the language set for in Model Forms A-30(b)-(d) of Appendix A to this part or substantially similar language. Any such figures must be disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be received, using the language set forth in Model Forms A-30(b) through (d) of Appendix A to this part, as appropriate, or substantially similar language. The exchange rate used to calculate any disclosed non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider is the exchange rate used in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by § 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate. Although new § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) makes the disclosure of the amount of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the provider optional, the Bureau believes that providers may be motivated to collect and disclose such information voluntarily, in the interest of providing high levels of customer service to senders and to better compete for remittance business against other providers.</analysisParagraph>
     <analysisParagraph>New comment 31(b)(1)(viii)-1 clarifies that if non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider apply to a particular remittance transfer, or if a provider does not know if such fees or taxes may apply to a particular remittance transfer, § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) requires the provider to include the disclaimer with respect to such fees and taxes. Comment 31(b)(1)(viii)-1 additionally clarifies that required disclosures under § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) may only be provided to the extent applicable. For example, if the designated recipient's institution is an agent of the provider and thus, non-covered third-party fees cannot apply to the transfer, the provider must disclose all fees imposed on the remittance transfer and may not provide the disclaimer regarding non-covered third-party fees. In this scenario, the commentary clarifies, the provider may only provide the disclaimer regarding taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, as applicable.</analysisParagraph>
     <analysisParagraph>New comment 31(b)(1)(viii)-2 explains that § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) permits a provider to disclose the amount of any non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider. For example, when a remittance transfer provider knows that the designated recipient's institution imposes a fee or that a foreign tax will apply, the provider may choose to disclose the relevant fee or tax as part of the information disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii). The comment also notes that § 1005.32(b)(3) permits the provider to disclose estimated amounts of such taxes and fees, provided any estimates are based on reasonable source of information. See comment 32(b)(3)-1. It further provides that where the provider chooses, at its option, to disclose the amounts of the relevant recipient institution fee or tax as part of the information disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii), the provider must not include that fee or tax in the amounts disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) or (b)(1)(vii).</analysisParagraph>

    <title>31(b)(2)(i) Pre-Payment Disclosures on Receipt</title>
    <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(b)(2)(i) in the 2012 Final Rule provides that the same disclosures included in the pre-payment disclosure must be disclosed on the receipt. As discussed above, the Bureau is adding a new requirement that pre-payment disclosures include disclaimers when non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the provider may apply. In addition, as stated above, to facilitate compliance and further the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its exception authority under EFTA section 904(c) to revise § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) to eliminate the requirement to include non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider in the calculation of the amount received, disclosed on the receipt provided to the sender under § 1005.31(b)(2)(i), consistent with the narrowed scope of § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). As discussed above, to further the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau also believes that it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to require providers to include disclaimers stating, as applicable, that non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected by a person other than the provider may apply to the remittance transfer and result in the designated recipient receiving less than the amount disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii). Accordingly, the Bureau is amending the cross-reference in § 1005.31(b)(2)(i) to require that such disclaimers be provided on the receipt. These changes would also be reflected on a combined disclosure. See § 1005.31(b)(3).</analysisParagraph>

    <title>31(c)(1) Grouping</title>
    <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(3)(A) states that disclosures provided pursuant to EFTA section 919 must be clear and conspicuous. The 2012 Final Rule incorporates this requirement and sets forth grouping, proximity, prominence, size, and segregation requirements to ensure that it is satisfied. In particular, § 1005.31(c)(1) requires that information about the transfer amount, fees and taxes imposed by a person other than the provider, and amount received by the designated recipient be grouped together. The purpose of this grouping requirement is to make clear to the sender how the total amount to be transferred to the designated recipient, in the currency to be made available to the designated recipient, will be reduced by fees imposed or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider. As previously discussed, under the 2013 Final Rule the disclosure of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider is no longer required under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), or included in the calculation of the amount required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii), but instead is subject to new § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii). Consequently, the 2013 Final Rule amends § 1005.31(c)(1) to group the new § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) disclosure requirement with the information required by §§ 1005.31(b)(1)(v), (vi), and (vii). The Bureau believes that this grouping will ensure that the sender will understand that the total amount received by the designated recipient will be affected by these additional fees and taxes as applicable. In addition, the Bureau clarifies that although disclosures provided via mobile application or text message to the extent permitted by § 1005.31(a)(5) generally need not comply with the grouping requirements, information required or permitted by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) must be grouped with § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii). The Bureau believes that it is important that the new disclaimers—which advise of potential additional fees and taxes—be grouped with the disclosure of the amount to be received by the designated recipient in order to maximize the likelihood that senders will see the disclaimers and read them in conjunction with the disclosures under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii). Insofar as the Bureau is requiring that information required or permitted by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) be grouped with § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) for disclosures provided via mobile application or text message, the Bureau is adding guidance in comment 31(c)(1)-1 to explain that to comply with the requirement a provider could send multiple text messages sequentially to provide the full disclosure.</analysisParagraph>

    <title>31(c)(2) Proximity</title>
    <analysisParagraph>To effectuate EFTA section 919(a)(3)(A), § 1005.31(c)(2) of the 2012 Final Rule also requires that certain disclosures be placed in close proximity to each other. The purpose of this proximity requirement is to prevent such disclosures from being overlooked by a sender. As previously discussed, under the 2013 Final Rule the disclosure of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected by a person other than the provider is no longer required under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi); instead, remittance transfer providers are subject to the new disclosure provision of § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii). Consequently, the 2013 Final Rule amends § 1005.31(c) to require that the new § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) disclaimers be in close proximity with the disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) (the amount received by the designated recipient). Section 1005.31(c)(2) further notes that disclosures provided via mobile application or text message, to the extent permitted by § 1005.31(a)(5), generally need not comply with the proximity requirements of § 1005.31(c), except that information required or permitted by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) must follow the information required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii). The Bureau believes that it is important that the new disclaimers—which advise of potential additional fees and taxes—be grouped in close proximity to the disclosure of the amount to be received by the designated recipient. Insofar as the total amount to be received may not include certain items the disclosure of which is no longer required, the disclaimers should be placed in close proximity to, or in the case of disclosures provided via mobile application or text message follow, the disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) in order to maximize the likelihood that senders will see the disclaimers and read them in conjunction with the amount disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii).</analysisParagraph>

    <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(c)(4) provides that written and electronic disclosures required by subpart B must be segregated from everything else and contain only information that is directly related to the disclosures required under subpart B. Comment 31(c)(4)-2 in the 2012 Final Rule clarifies that, for purposes of § 1005.31(c)(4), the following is directly related information: (i) The date and time of the transaction; (ii) the sender's name and contact information; (iii) the location at which the designated recipient may pick up the funds; (iv) the confirmation or other identification code; (v) a company name and logo; (vi) an indication that a disclosure is or is not a receipt or other indicia of proof of payment; (vii) a designated area for signatures or initials; (viii) a statement that funds may be available sooner, as permitted by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii); (ix) instructions regarding the retrieval of funds, such as the number of days the funds will be available to the recipient before they are returned to the sender; and (x) a statement that the provider makes money from foreign currency exchange. In light of new § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) permitting certain optional disclosures, the Bureau is amending this list to clarify that the optional disclosure of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected by a person other than the provider is directly related information.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>31(f) Accurate When Payment Is Made</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(f) of the 2012 Final Rule states that except as provided in § 1005.36(b), disclosures required by this section must be accurate when a sender makes payment for the remittance transfer, except to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32. In light of the new disclaimer required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii), as well as the optional disclosures under that paragraph, the Bureau is making conforming edits to § 1005.31(f) and comment 31(f)-1 to note that the disclosures required by § 1005.31(b) or permitted by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) must be accurate when a sender makes payment for the remittance transfer, except to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32. Comment 31(f)-1 further notes that while a remittance transfer provider is not required to guarantee the terms of the remittance transfer in the disclosures required or permitted by § 1005.31(b) for any specific period of time, if any of the disclosures required or permitted by § 1005.31(b) are not accurate when a sender makes payment for the remittance transfer, a provider must give new disclosures before accepting payment.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that extending the accuracy requirement to the optional disclosures regarding non-covered third party fees and taxes collected by persons other than the remittance transfer provider is necessary in order to communicate accurately to the sender how confident the remittance transfer provider is concerning the information provided. As discussed above, the Bureau believes that such information can be useful to senders under certain circumstances and hopes to encourage use of increasingly reliable information over time. Although the vast majority of remittance transfer providers may choose to disclose any numbers provided as estimates due to the various uncertainties with regard to foreign taxes and fees discussed above, the Bureau believes it is important to preserve remittance transfer providers' ability to compete based on disclosure of actual figures.</analysisParagraph>

    <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(g) of the 2012 Final Rule explains that disclosures required by the rule must be provided in English and, in certain circumstances, in other languages as well. Similar to the changes discussed above regarding § 1005.31(a)(1) concerning clear and conspicuous disclosures, the Bureau is making conforming edits to § 1005.31(g)(1) to reflect the addition of the optional disclosures elsewhere in the 2013 Final Rule. While the disclosures are optional (see §§ 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) and 1005.33(h)(3)), the Bureau believes it is important that they conform to the 2013 foreign language disclosure requirements. Thus, the Bureau is amending § 1005.31(g)(1) to state that except as provided in § 1005.31(g)(2), disclosures required by this subpart or permitted by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) or § 1005.33(h)(3) must be made in English and, if applicable in accordance with § 1005.31(g)(1)(i) and (ii).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>33(h)(2)</title>
      <analysisParagraph>In the December Proposal, the Bureau noted that typically remittance transfer providers have no means to verify whether a sender provided account number for the designated recipient is accurate.  Thus, the Bureau did not propose, as a condition of the proposed exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D), that providers verify account numbers before sending a remittance transfer to an account.  However, and as noted above, the Bureau is expanding the exception to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) to include senders' mistakes regarding recipient institution identifiers, as well as mistakes regarding account numbers.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In response to the Bureau's request for comment on sender mistakes generally, some industry commenters acknowledged that, in some instances, institution identifier information provided by senders may be at least partially verifiable.  Foremost among these are BICs (sometimes referred to as SWIFT codes) and other recipient institution identifiers.  Commenters noted, however, that verification is neither ubiquitous nor perfect.  Several consumer group commenters argued, on the other hand, that the Bureau should not expand the exception to mistakes regarding recipient institution identifiers because remittance transfer providers should be able to verify such identifiers.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>As a result of the Bureau's inclusion of recipient institution identifiers in the exception to the definition of error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D), the Bureau is adopting new § 1005.33(h)(2), which provides that for any instance in which the sender provided the incorrect recipient institution identifier, prior to or when sending the transfer, the provider used reasonably available means to verify that the recipient institution identifier provided by the sender corresponded to the recipient institution name provided by the sender.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>As adopted, § 1005.33(h)(2) will permit remittance transfer providers to rely on the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) only in situations where no reasonable verification is possible or where reasonably available means were applied but were unable to prevent a mis-deposit that occurred because the sender provided an incorrect recipient institution identifier.  The exception does not apply to account number mistakes insofar as the Bureau continues to believe that no reasonable means to verify that an account number matches the name of the designated recipient disclosed to the sender exists today for most transfers. The Bureau will continue to monitor whether expansion of the condition is appropriate.  Furthermore, § 1005.33(h)(2) requires that the verification occur prior to or when the provider is sending the transfer because if the verification occurs later it may be too late to prevent a mis-deposit.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting new comment 33(h)-1, which explains that the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) applies only when a sender provides an incorrect recipient institution identifier, § 1005.33(h)(2) limits the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to situations where the provider used reasonably available means to verify that the recipient institution identifier provided by the sender did correspond to the recipient institution name provided by the sender.  Reasonably available means may include accessing a directory of Business Identifier Codes and verifying that the code provided by the sender matches the provided institution name, and, if possible, the specific branch or location provided by the sender.  Comment 33(h)-1 explains that providers may also rely on other commercially available databases or directories to check other recipient institution identifiers.  If reasonable verification means fail to identify that the recipient institution identifier is incorrect, the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) will apply, assuming that the provider can satisfy the other conditions in § 1005.33(h).  Similarly, if no reasonably available means exist to verify the accuracy of the recipient institution identifier, § 1005.33(h)(2) would be satisfied and thus the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) also will apply, again assuming the provider can satisfy the other conditions in § 1005.33(h).  However, where a provider does not employ reasonably available means to verify a recipient institution identifier, § 1005.33(h)(2) is not satisfied and the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) will not apply.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting this provision because upon further consideration, it concludes that if remittance transfer providers want to avail themselves of the exception to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) for mistakes regarding recipient institution identifiers, they must take reasonable steps to limit the occurrence of these mistakes.  The Bureau believes that, in many instances providers can and currently do verify the accuracy of some identifiers, and that in many other instances verification is not feasible.  For example, many providers require, and senders provide, BICs to identify recipient institutions.  Providers, or their third-party partners, typically have access to a directory in which they can match the BIC with the institution name (and possibly location), and the Bureau believes many providers (or their business partners) perform such verifications today.  The Bureau also recognizes, however, that some providers may not conduct such verification.  In other instances, precise verification that the sender has identified the proper institution may be challenging, particularly if a recipient institution has no BIC code or other type of identifier for which there is an internationally accessible directory, or if a sender has not given all the information about the recipient institution that may be reflected in a numerical identifier, such as the branch location.<footnote ref="10">See &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.swift.com/products_services/bic_and_iban_format_registration_bic_details.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
              The Bureau believes the requirement appropriately requires verification where such mechanisms are reasonable available.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau notes that it intends to monitor the availability of other means to verify account numbers and recipient institution identifiers and it may propose to revise § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) and (h)(2) and the related commentary if such means become reasonably available.</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.33(h)(2) would have required a remittance transfer provider to demonstrate that the sender had notice that, if the sender provided an incorrect account number, the sender could lose the transfer amount.  Although the Bureau did not propose a specific form of notice under proposed § 1005.33(h)(2), it requested comment on whether the Bureau should specify the form of the notice and when and how such notice should be delivered.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters were largely divided on whether the Bureau should provide specific form and content instructions for the required notice.  However, no commenter objected to the basic requirement of notice, and several commenters affirmatively agreed that notice would be beneficial.  Those commenters who preferred that the Bureau specify a specific form for the required notice, including several smaller depository institutions, argued that model language provided by the Bureau would ease their compliance burden, particularly if there were a safe harbor for its use.  Those commenters who preferred the flexibility of the proposed notice provisions argued that remittance transfer providers may already provide this sort of notice in a number of different forms.  To require, or encourage through a safe harbor, specific model language or a form, these commenters contended, would cause remittance transfer providers to incur additional compliance costs as they would be required to alter existing forms and practices to match whatever the Bureau has established.  In addition, these commenters argued, providers would need additional time to comply with this final rule if they were required to use specific language to provide the proposed notice.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Several consumer group commenters argued that the proposed notice should be provided in a clear and conspicuous manner and in the same language that the rest of the transfer is conducted.  These commenters urged the Bureau to adopt a notice that comports with the clarity and language requirements of similar disclosures in other consumer statutes.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau adopts proposed § 1005.33(h)(2) with three changes as § 1005.33(h)(3).  New § 1005.33(h)(3) provides as a condition of § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) exception, a requirement that the remittance transfer provider provided notice to the sender before the sender made payment for the remittance transfer that, in the event the sender provided an incorrect account number or recipient institution identifier, the sender could lose the transfer amount.  The provision also provides that for purposes of providing the § 1005.33(h)(3) notice, § 1005.31(a)(2) applies to this notice unless the notice is given at the same time as other disclosures required by subpart B for which information is permitted to be disclosed orally or via mobile application or text message, in which case this disclosure may be given in the same medium as the other disclosures</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>This provision reflects three changes from the December Proposal:  (1) Mention of recipient institution identifiers in light of the expanded scope of § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D); (2) clarification that the notice must be provided before the sender authorizes the remittance transfer; (3) clarification that this notice may be given orally if provided along with a prepayment disclosure provided orally in accordance with § 1005.31(a)(2).<footnote ref="11">Section 1005.31(a)(2) generally requires disclosures required by subpart B of Regulation E to be in writing.  The provision makes exceptions for pre-payment disclosures, which may be provided electronically.</footnote>
              The Bureau believes that the requirement that the notice be provided before authorization of the transfer is generally in accordance with how most providers currently provide notice today and thus should not be a significant change from existing practice. The 2013 Final Rule does not specify the form of such notice but the Bureau intends to monitor how providers implement this condition to determine whether additional specificity is appropriate.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that, pursuant to the revisions to § 1005.31(a)(1) discussed above, the notice provided pursuant to § 1005.33(h)(3), like all disclosures required by subpart B of Regulation E, in § 1005.33(h)(3) must be clear and conspicuous. <em data-original="E-03">See also</em> comment 33(a)(1)-1.  In addition, insofar as the Bureau has also amended the foreign language requirements of § 1005.31(g) to apply to all disclosures permitted by the 2013 Final Rule, the notice permitted by § 1005.33(h)(3) must be disclosed in accordance with the foreign language disclosure requirements of § 1005.33(g)(1).</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>As explained in the December Proposal, the Bureau's goal is to ensure that senders are informed of the risks of a mistake.  Given that many remittance transfer providers are already providing notices of this risk through various means, the Bureau wants to ensure that the practice is adopted across the remainder of the industry while minimizing the need to change existing notices if they were already sufficient for the purposes of proposed § 1005.33(h)(2).  While the Bureau understands that providing model language might make compliance easier for some providers, the Bureau believes that there are sufficient models available in providers' existing materials that it is inappropriate to delay adoption of this condition while the Bureau designs and tests appropriate model language.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>Appendix A—Model Disclosure Clauses and Forms</title>
            <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed in Appendix A twelve model forms that a remittance transfer provider could use in connection with remittance transfers. The disclosures were proposed as model forms pursuant to EFTA section 904(a), rather than model clauses pursuant to EFTA section 904(b), in order to clearly demonstrate the general form and specific format requirements of proposed § 205.31(a) and (c). Proposed Model Forms A-30 through A-32 were developed in consumer testing and reflect a format in which the flow and organization of information effectively communicates the remittance disclosures to most consumers. Proposed Model Forms A-30 through A-41 were intended to demonstrate several formats a remittance transfer provider may use to comply with the disclosure requirements of proposed § 205.31.<footnote ref="88">Proposed Model Forms A-33 through A-35 and proposed Model Form A-37 were variations of the forms that were developed in consumer testing. Proposed Model Forms A-38 through A-40 were Spanish translations of proposed Model Forms A-30 through A-32. The language in the long form error resolution and cancellation notice in proposed Model Form A-36, and its Spanish translation in Model Form A-41, were based on the model form for error resolution in Regulation E. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 12 CFR part 1005, Appendix A to part 1005, Form A-3.</footnote></analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed to amend instruction 2 to Appendix A regarding the use of model forms and added instruction 4 to Appendix A to describe how a remittance transfer provider may properly use and alter the model forms. Specifically, the Board proposed to amend instruction 2 to Appendix A to include references to remittance transfer providers and remittance transfers and updated the numbering of the liability provisions of the EFTA as sections 916 and 917. The proposed instruction therefore clarified that the use of the proposed model forms in making disclosures would protect a remittance transfer provider from liability under sections 916 and 917 of the EFTA if they accurately reflected the provider's remittance transfer services. The Bureau did not receive comments on proposed instruction 2, and it is adopted substantially as proposed, with an addition to reference § 1005.36 that was added in the final rule.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also did not receive any comments on proposed instruction 4 to Appendix A, and it is adopted substantially as proposed. The instruction includes one change to address the Bureau's role in reviewing and approving disclosure forms. The instruction also contains modifications to address the addition of § 1005.36 in the final rule. Accordingly, instruction 4 to Appendix A states that the Bureau will not review or approve disclosure forms for remittance transfer providers, but that the appendix contains 12 model forms for use in connection with remittance transfers. The instruction explains that Model Forms A-30 through A-32 demonstrate how a provider can provide the required disclosures for a remittance transfer exchanged into local currency. Model Forms A-33 through A-35 demonstrate how a provider can provide the required disclosures for U.S. dollar-to-U.S. dollar remittance transfers. These forms also demonstrate disclosure of the required content, in accordance with the grouping and proximity requirements of § 1005.31(c)(1) and (2), in both a register receipt format and an 8.5 inch by 11 inch format. Model Form A-36 provides long form model error resolution and cancellation disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(4), and Model Form A-37 provides short form model error resolution and cancellation disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) and (vi).</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Instruction 4 to Appendix A also explains that a remittance transfer provider may use the language and formatting provided in Forms A-38 through A-41 for disclosures that are required to be provided in Spanish, pursuant to the requirements of § 1005.31(g). It also clarifies that the model forms may contain certain information that is not required by subpart B, such as a confirmation code and the sender's name and contact information. This information is included on the model forms to demonstrate one way of displaying this information in compliance with § 1005.31(c)(4). Any additional information must be presented consistent with a remittance transfer provider's obligation to provide required disclosures in a clear and conspicuous manner.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Instruction 4 to Appendix A further clarifies that use of the model forms is optional. A remittance transfer provider may change the forms by rearranging the format or by making modifications to the language of the forms, without modifying the substance of the disclosures. The instruction clarifies that rearrangement or modification of the format of the model forms is permissible, as long as it is consistent with the form, grouping, proximity, and other requirements of § 1005.31(a) and (c). Providers making revisions that do not comply with this section will lose the benefit of the safe harbor for appropriate use of Model Forms A-30 to A-41.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Instruction 4 to Appendix A also provides examples of permissible changes a remittance transfer provider may make to the language and format of the model forms without losing the benefit of the safe harbor. For example, a remittance transfer provider may substitute the information contained in the model forms that is intended to demonstrate how to complete the information in the model forms—such as names, addresses, and Web sites; dates; numbers; and State-specific contact information—with information applicable to the remittance transfer. A remittance transfer provider may also eliminate disclosures that are not applicable to the transfer, as permitted under § 1005.31(b), or provide the required disclosures on a paper size that is different from a register receipt and 8.5 inch by 11 inch formats. A remittance transfer provider may correct or update telephone numbers, mailing addresses, or Web site addresses that may change over time. This example applies to all telephone numbers and addresses on a model form, including the contact information of the provider, the State agency, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The instruction clarifies that adding the term “Estimated” or a substantially similar term and in close proximity to the estimated term or terms, as required under § 1005.31(d), is a permissible change to the model forms. A provider may provide the required disclosures in a foreign language, or multiple foreign languages, subject to the requirements of § 1005.31(g), without losing the benefit of the safe harbor.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Instruction 4 to Appendix A includes an additional example of a permissible change a remittance transfer provider may make to the language and format of the model forms without losing the benefit of the safe harbor to reflect the addition of § 1005.36 in the final rule. The instruction clarifies that a remittance transfer provider may substitute cancellation language to reflect the right to a cancellation made pursuant to the requirements of § 1005.36(c). For example, for disclosures provided for a preauthorized remittance transfer, a provider could replace the statement that a sender can cancel the remittance transfer within 30 minutes with a statement that a sender may cancel up to three business days before the date of each transfer. Finally, instruction 4 to Appendix A also clarifies that adding language to a form that is not segregated from the required disclosures is impermissible, other than as permitted by § 1005.31(c)(4).</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Although the Bureau did not receive comments on the instructions to Model Forms A-30 through A-41, the Bureau did receive suggested changes to the terminology used in and the formatting of the model forms. For example, consumer group commenters believed that the amount of the cost of the transaction expressed as “Total” in the proposal should be labeled in bold as “Total cost to you of this transfer” and that “Total to recipient” should be labeled in bold as “Total amount recipient should receive.” The commenters also believed the term “Total Amount” was too generic and instead should be “Amount Transferred.” An industry commenter believed that fees and taxes charged by entities other than the remittance transfer provided should be labeled as “Receive” or “Payout” fees and taxes, rather than “Other” fees and taxes.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that the proposed terms sufficiently describe the amounts disclosed on the model forms. The proposed terms were used in consumer testing, and nearly all participants understood the amounts that were disclosed. Moreover, the Bureau believes that requiring bolding or similar font requirements could pose compliance difficulties for remittance transfer providers that print the disclosures on a register or other printing device that does not permit such font changes, and participants in consumer testing did not have difficulty finding this information on the forms. Thus, the Bureau is adopting the terms and format as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters asserted that the content of the long form error resolution and cancellation notice in Model Form A-36 was misleading and not consumer friendly. The commenters provided edits to the disclosure that the commenter believed would be more helpful to a sender. The long form error resolution and cancellation disclosure is based on the model form for error resolution in Regulation E. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 31 CFR part 1005, Appendix A to part 1005, Form A-3. The Bureau believes that any changes to this model form should be made in conjunction with the corresponding changes to existing Regulation E model forms and that such changes should be subject to consumer testing. Therefore, the Bureau is adopting the content of Model Form A-36 as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Other commenters suggested substantive changes that, if adopted, would result in changes to the model forms. For example, some industry commenters suggested that the Bureau eliminate the requirement to disclose fees and taxes charged by a person other than the remittance transfer provider and that the model forms should instead indicate generally that other fees and charges may apply. Similarly, industry commenters suggested the exchange rate and funds availability date should be permitted to be estimated and, therefore, the model forms should state that these disclosures are subject to change. As discussed above, the Bureau is not adopting these substantive changes in the final rule. Consequently, the Bureau is not adopting the corresponding changes to the model forms.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Finally, a consumer advocate suggested that a fraud warning should be added to the model forms. Such a warning is not required in the statute, and the Bureau believes that the disclosures should be limited to information relating to cost, error resolution, and cancellation. Adding more information and warnings to forms could overwhelm a sender and result in the sender not reading any of the information on the form. Therefore, the Bureau is not adding such a fraud warning to the model disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is, however, making two changes to the model forms that reflect changes from the proposal to the final rule, as discussed above. First, the Bureau is requiring that fees and taxes must be disclosed separately. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 31(b)(1)-1. As such, the model forms have been amended to demonstrate how a remittance transfer provider would disclose fees separately from taxes. Second, the final rule provides that a sender may cancel a transaction within thirty minutes of making payment, rather than within one business day, as proposed, and the model forms have been amended to reflect this change.<footnote ref="89">As noted above, this cancellation language may be amended to the extent § 1005.36(c) applies.</footnote></analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is making additional changes to Model Form A-37 in the final rule. The Bureau is removing sample phone number, Web site, and remittance transfer company name that was included in the proposed form. Unlike the model pre-payment disclosures, receipts, and combined disclosures, sample information is not necessary to demonstrate how the short form error resolution and cancellation disclosures should be completed. Thus, in the final rule, Model Form A-37 includes brackets indicating where this information should be entered by a provider. The forward slash used in the proposal to indicate that funds may be picked up or deposited is also replaced with the word “or.” The Bureau is also amending the abbreviated statement about senders' error resolution rights on Model Form A-37 to include a more explicit statement informing senders that they have such rights.<footnote ref="90">These changes were also made to Model Forms A-31, A-32, A-34, and A-35 where the language in Model Form A-37 is used. The changes are also reflected in the Spanish language disclosures.</footnote></analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also making minor technical changes in some of the model forms in the final rule for clarity. Plus signs are added to some forms to indicate where fees and taxes will be added to a transfer amount to better demonstrate the calculation of the total amount paid by the sender.<footnote ref="91">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See,&lt;/em&gt; Model Forms A-30 through A-35 and A-38 through A-40.</footnote>
              The internet address for the sample State regulatory agency is also amended on some forms with the suffix “.gov” rather than “.com.”<footnote ref="92">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See,&lt;/em&gt; Model Forms A-31, A-32, A-34, A-35, A-39, and A-40.</footnote>
              The toll-free telephone numbers for the Bureau have also been added to some forms.<footnote ref="93">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See,&lt;/em&gt; Model Forms A-31, A-32, A-34, A-35, A-39, and A-40.</footnote></analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, Model Forms A-38 through A-41 may be used when disclosures are required to be disclosed in Spanish, pursuant to the requirements in § 1005.31(g). The Board proposed model disclosures in Spanish to facilitate compliance with this foreign language requirement and requested comment on the disclosures. One commenter submitted spelling, grammar and verb tense revisions to the Spanish language disclosures. The commenter believed the Spanish language disclosures, as proposed, did not adequately communicate the intent of the language used in the English disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Certain commenter-suggested revisions have been made in Model Forms A-38 through A-41 to correct inaccuracies in the proposed Spanish language disclosures. However, in other instances, the suggested revisions have not been made. Although the proposed language and the commenter-suggested revisions reflected stylistic variations, both contained accurate translations of the English language model forms. Therefore, the technical corrections are included in Model Forms A-38 through A-41 in the final rule. The Bureau also made stylistic changes to the Spanish language model forms that it believes better tracks the language in the English language disclosures.<footnote ref="94">One of the stylistic changes made to the Spanish language model forms was to change the format for the dates to eliminate possible consumer confusion as to the day, the month, and the year. Similar changes have been made to the English language model forms for consistency.</footnote></analysisParagraph>
            <analysisSection>
              <title>Effective Date</title>
              <analysisParagraph>The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Bureau to issue final rules on certain provisions of EFTA section 919 within 18 months from the date of enactment. However, the statute does not specify an effective date for these provisions. The Board solicited comment in the May 2011 Proposed Rule on whether an effective date of one year from the date the final rule is published, or an alternative effective date would be appropriate.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter agreed that 12 months would be an appropriate time period to implement the remittance transfer provisions. However, several other industry commenters recommended that the effective date of the final rule be set 18 to 24 months from the date that the final rule is issued. In suggesting this time period, money transmitter commenters stated that they would need time to change hardware printers and software. Agents of remittance transfer providers would also need time to integrate software from the remittance transfer provider with their point of sale systems. Industry commenters also requested time to deplete their existing form stock, develop and implement proper training programs, and amend contracts with agent locations worldwide.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Financial institution commenters cited the need for messaging, settlement, and payment systems, such as the ACH network and SWIFT, to evaluate and possibly amend operating rules, message formats, contracts, and participant agreements. These commenters also stated they would need time to: Complete processing system modifications; develop disclosures, operating procedures, marketing and employee training materials; and make modifications to agreements with correspondents and other intermediaries. They further requested that the Bureau take into account other regulatory requirement set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act that financial institutions must implement in addition to the remittance transfer provisions.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Given the time period set for compliance with other consumer financial protection regulations, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to set an effective date one year from the date of publication of the final rule in the <em data-original="E-04">Federal Register</em>. In setting this effective date, the Bureau believes that this time frame best balances the significant consumer protection interests addressed by this rule against industry's need to make systems changes to comply with the final rule. Therefore, the disclosure requirements in § 1005.31 will apply to remittance transfers that are requested by a sender on or after the effective date. Only remittance transfers for which a sender made payment on or after the effective date will be eligible for the error resolution and refund and cancellation requirements of §§ 1005.33 and 1005.34. For preauthorized remittance transfers, the disclosure requirements in § 1005.36(a) and (b) will apply to preauthorized remittance transfers authorized by a sender on or after the effective date. For transactions subject to § 1005.36(c), the error resolution and refund requirements of §§ 1005.33 and 1005.34 and the cancellation requirements of § 1005.36(c) will apply to transfers authorized by a sender on or after the effective date.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>Appendix A—Model Disclosure Clauses and Forms</title>
            <analysisParagraph>In Appendix A of the 2012 Final Rule, the Bureau provides twelve model forms that a remittance transfer provider may use in connection with remittance transfers.  The 2012 Final Rule also provides instructions related to the use of these model forms.  In particular, Instruction 4 to Appendix A provides general instructions for how providers may use the model forms, including instructions as to formatting and necessary disclosures.  Instruction 4 also describes what portions of the disclosures are optional, and states that the Bureau will not review or approve providers' disclosure forms.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In light of the changes to the 2012 Final Rule's disclosure requirements discussed above, the 2013 Final Rule amends the model forms, as well as the related instructions in Appendix A, and includes several additional model forms reflecting the new requirements.  First, the Bureau is removing from all of the model forms references to “Other Taxes” because the Bureau has eliminated this disclosure requirement. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi).  Second, although there is no longer a requirement to disclose recipient institution fees in certain circumstances, there remains a requirement that remittance transfer providers disclose covered third-party fees under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi).  As a result, the line on the model forms that relates to the disclosure of the amount of “Other Fees” has been retained and will now reflect only covered third-party fees imposed upon the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Third, insofar as § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) requires a remittance transfer provider to include disclaimers on the required disclosures where non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider may apply, the model forms have been amended to include versions of these disclaimers.  These disclaimers are required unless a provider knows that neither non-covered third-party fees nor taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider apply. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) and comment 31(b)(1)(viii)-1.  Thus, where a disclaimer is necessary, there are now three potential disclaimer statements that could be used depending on the nature of the transaction:  (1) A disclaimer that states that the recipient may receive less due to fees charged by the recipient's bank;<footnote ref="12">In the interest of clarity on the model forms, non-covered third-party fees are referred to as “fees charged by a recipient's bank.”  However, to the extent that the term “bank” is imprecise, a provider may use an alternate term to describe the recipient institution.</footnote>
              (2) A disclaimer that states that the recipient may receive less due to foreign taxes;<footnote ref="13">Also in the interest of clarity, these taxes are described as “foreign taxes,” although it is possible that the taxes collected by a person other than the provider could include taxes imposed by a U.S. state or the Federal government where such taxes are not collected by the provider.</footnote>
              or (3) A disclaimer that states that the recipient may receive less due to fees charged by the recipient's bank and foreign taxes.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In addition to the requirement to include these disclaimers, a remittance transfer provider may also elect to disclose the actual or estimated amounts of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected by a person other than the provider. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> §§ 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) and 1005.32(b)(3).  Model forms A-30(a) through (d) include samples of how a provider may include versions of these required disclaimers, as well as the optional disclosures regarding the actual or estimated amount of such fees and taxes.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Specifically, Model Form A-30(a) provides sample disclaimer language that “a recipient may receive less due to fees charged by the recipient's bank and foreign taxes.”  Model Forms A-30(b) through (d) include examples of how a remittance transfer provider could include the optional estimates of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider.  Specifically, Model Form A-30(b) includes a sample disclaimer that shows a parenthetical containing an estimate of the applicable non-covered third-party fees that may apply to the sample transfer, while Model Form A-30(c) includes a sample disclaimer that shows a parenthetical with an estimate for the taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider that may apply.  Model Form A-30(d) includes an example for how a provider could provide an estimate for both non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider.  Finally, although not included in a model form, if a provider knows that fees or taxes will be deducted, the disclaimer could indicate that the recipient “will receive less,” rather than “may receive less,” due to non-disclosed fees and taxes.  A provider also may elect to include the precise amounts for fees and/or taxes.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Instruction 4 also has been amended to indicate that the disclosure of the actual or estimated amounts for non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected by a person other than the provider is optional as provided in § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) in the 2013 Final Rule.  Instruction 4 also now includes language that a remittance transfer provider cannot include disclaimers that cannot apply to the particular transfer.  For example, if the provider knows that the only fees that can apply to the transfer are covered third-party fees, a provider should not include a fee disclaimer. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) and comment 31(b)(1)(viii)-1.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Finally, because additional model forms have been added, the Appendix and Instructions are revised to indicate that there are now 15 model forms.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisSection>
              <title>Effective Date</title>
              <analysisParagraph>This final rule is effective on October 28, 2013.  As discussed below, the Bureau believes that this effective date will, on balance, facilitate the implementation of both the remaining requirements of the 2012 Final Rule and the new requirements of the 2013 Final Rule.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In the December Proposal, the Bureau proposed to temporarily delay the effective date of the 2012 Final Rule from February 7, 2013, until 90 days after the publication of the 2013 Final Rule in the <em data-original="E-04">Federal Register</em>.  The Bureau stated then that it believed that this modest delay would balance the need for consumers to receive the protections afforded by the rule as quickly as possible with industry's need to make adjustments to comply with the provisions of the rule.  As part of the December Proposal, the Bureau sought comment on this proposed 90-day extension period.  On January 29, 2013, in the Temporary Delay Rule, the Bureau temporarily delayed the February 7, 2013 effective date pending completion of this rulemaking.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>All commenters—including consumer group commenters—generally agreed that the Bureau should extend the effective date of the 2013 Final Rule until at least 90 days after it is published in the <em data-original="E-04">Federal Register</em>.  Although no commenters suggested an implementation period of fewer than 90 days following publication of the 2013 Final Rule, one consumer group commenter noted that while it did not object to a 90 day-extension, it saw no need for any implementation period longer than 90 days after the finalization of this rule.  Additionally, one industry trade association suggested a 90-day implementation period could be workable depending on the scope of the final rule.  Most industry commenters, however, urged the Bureau to extend the effective date beyond 90 days.  In doing so, industry commenters suggested a range of periods—with many industry commenters suggesting periods of between 180 and 365 days following the publication of the 2013 Final Rule.  One industry trade association provided an example of an implementation timeline suggesting that a large correspondent would need at least 121 days from when the final rule is released in order to integrate a compliance solution within its client banks' systems.  Industry commenters in general contended that remittance transfer providers, their vendors, and other business partners all would need additional time to adjust their computer systems and compliance procedures, renegotiate contracts, and train staff.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Separately, commenters representing smaller insured institutions in particular requested a longer implementation period, stating that many of these remittance transfer providers depend on larger third-parties to aid their compliance.  These commenters uniformly stated that smaller providers might face particular challenges with implementing necessary changes over a short time period because smaller providers will only be able to integrate compliance solutions after the third parties have incorporated necessary updates and conduct testing, and include the changes in their scheduled releases.  Relatedly, a number of these commenters referenced the Bureau's recent rulemakings pursuant to title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act<footnote ref="14">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Escrow Requirements under the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z), 78 FR 4725 (Jan. 22, 2013); Ability to Repay and Qualified Mortgage Standards Under the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z), 78 FR 6407 (Jan. 30, 2013; High-Cost Mortgage and Homeownership Counseling Amendments to the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z) and Homeownership Counseling Amendments to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (Regulation X), 78 FR 6855 (Jan. 31, 2013); Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (Regulation X) and Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z) Mortgage Servicing Final Rules, 78 FR 10695 (Feb. 14, 2013); Disclosure and Delivery Requirements for Copies of Appraisals and Other Written Valuations Under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (Regulation B), 78 FR 7215 (Jan. 31, 2013); Appraisals for Higher-Priced Mortgage Loans, 78 FR 10367 (Feb. 13, 2013); Loan Originator Compensation Requirements under the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z), 78 FR 11279 (Feb. 15, 2013).</footnote>
                and indicated that implementing all of the requirements of those rules and the requirements of this final rule at the same time will create a significant cumulative burden.  These industry commenters also expressed concern over both the breadth and complexity of new rules expected from the Bureau.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The industry commenters' concerns regarding the implementation period, particularly those relating to necessary system changes, were largely focused around three expected results of the 2012 Final Rule, as it would have been modified by the December Proposal: (1) The need to build and maintain a database of applicable taxes imposed by foreign countries' central governments; (2) the need to obtain fee schedules or other information regarding applicable recipient institution fees in order to compute estimates of the applicable fees; and (3) the need to adjust systems and processes to accommodate the provisions discussing resends to correct errors that occurred because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information.  Furthermore, some industry commenters suggested that the appropriate effective date would depend on the scope of the final rule.  Noting the difficulty of collecting certain information concerning recipient institution fees and foreign taxes, as indicated above, one industry trade association commenter indicated that if the Bureau eliminated the requirement to disclose recipient institution fees and foreign taxes and simplified the procedure for resends, then this commenter thought that a 90-day implementation period could be workable.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting an effective date of October 28, 2013.  In light of the way the Bureau has streamlined the requirements of the 2012 Final Rule, the Bureau believes that an effective date of October 28, 2013 (or approximately 180 days after the release of the 2013 Final Rule) will allow sufficient time for providers, both large and small, to implement any necessary changes to their systems in order to comply with the 2013 Final Rule.  The Bureau is adopting a date certain in order to eliminate the risks of delay and provide greater assurances to both consumers and industry as to when to expect the valuable protections of the new rule.  The Bureau also believes that this implementation period allows sufficient time because the Bureau is not adopting the aspects of the December Proposal that commenters identified as requiring the most time to implement.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The primary additional substantive requirements in the 2013 Final Rule are the requirement that remittance transfer providers include disclaimers regarding non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected by a person other than the provider and adopt additional verification measures and provide notice to senders of the potential loss of funds to take advantage of the Bureau's expansion of the exception to the definition of the term error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D).  The Bureau believes that any programmatic changes required by these  provisions should not take most providers a particularly long period of time to implement. To the extent providers need to change the terms of their consumer contracts or other communications to provide senders the notice contemplated by § 1005.33(h)(3), the Bureau expects the required time to produce this notice will be modest, particularly because the 2013 Final Rule does not mandate any particular notice form, or format apart from requiring that such notice be clear and conspicuous and meet certain foreign language requirements.  Although translating such notice may require testing and certain systems changes, and the Bureau expects that many providers will integrate any such notice into existing communications or the required prepayment disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Moreover, based on its outreach and monitoring of the market, the Bureau believes that responsible providers and correspondents are already using reasonable methods of verification to reduce the risk of errors.  Nonetheless, recognizing that the 2013 Final Rule will likely require changes to informational technology and operational procedures and that small providers may benefit from additional time in order to test compliance solutions for their customers, the Bureau believes a modest increase in the implementation period from what was proposed may limit potential disruptions in the remittance transfer market.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>For these reasons, the Bureau is expanding the implementation period for this final rule beyond what was proposed by making it effective October 28, 2013.</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisParagraph>Proposed 33(h)(3) would have stated that for a remittance transfer provider to avail itself of the exception in proposed § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D), the provider would be required to demonstrate that the incorrect account number resulted in the deposit of the remittance transfer into a customer's account that is not the designated recipient's.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received a number of comments from industry commenters and some consumer group commenters encouraging the Bureau to eliminate this proposed condition.  These commenters stated that even if funds are not deposited into another customer's account, other forms of improper routing due to erroneous information provided by a sender could cause transferred funds to be lost or, at the very least, delayed beyond the original date of availability.  Other consumer group commenters disagreed, however, asserting that, in their opinion, remittance transfer providers typically can retrieve funds that have been misrouted unless the funds are deposited into the wrong customer's account.  These consumer group commenters opined that so long as the funds remain in an institution's control, there is generally no concern that those funds will disappear.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.33(h)(3) substantially as proposed as § 1005.33(h)(4).  The Bureau believes, as stated in the December Proposal, that when a remittance transfer is sent with the wrong account number for the designated recipient, a remittance transfer provider will be far more likely to recover the funds in situations where the funds are either rejected by another institution or otherwise reversed before they are deposited into the wrong account.  To the extent that commenters' concerns related to the delay of funds rather than their disappearance, as noted above, the Bureau declines to expand the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to cover delayed transfers rather than actual mis-deposited transfers.</analysisParagraph>

The final rule adopts comment 30-1 to clarify the applicability of the definitions contained in § 1005.2 to subpart B.

              <analysisParagraph>In the December Proposal, the Bureau solicited comment on methods to reduce the burden of required disclosures of fees and taxes imposed on remittance transfers by persons other than the providers and alternative disclosures that could be provided.  Several industry and consumer group commenters suggested that in place of requiring exact or estimated disclosures of recipient institution fees or foreign taxes, the Bureau could require a statement within the disclosure forms alerting senders that the total amount received may be reduced by recipient institution fees or foreign taxes.  These commenters contended that such a disclosure would ensure that senders are aware of the potential for further reductions in the disclosed amount received, due to fees or taxes that are not disclosed, and would encourage senders and recipients to investigate the fees associated with a transfer to the recipient's financial institution, as compared to those associated with other mechanisms for sending a remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Although the Bureau is eliminating the requirement to calculate and disclose non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider, the Bureau strongly believes that it is nonetheless important to inform senders when fees and taxes that are not disclosed may apply to the remittance transfer.  Accordingly, to further the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes that it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to add § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii), which requires that a provider include, as applicable, a statement indicating that non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider may apply to the remittance transfer and result in the designated recipient receiving less than the amount disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii).  Moreover, under this paragraph, a provider may, but is not required to, disclose any applicable non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider using the language set for in Model Forms A-30(b)-(d) of Appendix A to this part or substantially similar language.  Any such figures must be disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be received, using the language set forth in Model Forms A-30(b) through (d) of Appendix A to this part, as appropriate, or substantially similar language.  The exchange rate used to calculate any disclosed non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider is the exchange rate used in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by § 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate.  Although new § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) makes the disclosure of the amount of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the provider optional, the Bureau believes that providers may be motivated to collect and disclose such information voluntarily, in the interest of providing high levels of customer service to senders and to better compete for remittance business against other providers.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>New comment 31(b)(1)(viii)-1 clarifies that if non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider apply to a particular remittance transfer, or if a provider does not know if such fees or taxes may apply to a particular remittance transfer, § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) requires the provider to include the disclaimer with respect to such fees and taxes.  Comment 31(b)(1)(viii)-1 additionally clarifies that required disclosures under § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) may only be provided to the extent applicable.  For example, if the designated recipient's institution is an agent of the provider and thus, non-covered third-party fees cannot apply to the transfer, the provider must disclose all fees imposed on the remittance transfer and may not provide the disclaimer regarding non-covered third-party fees.  In this scenario, the commentary clarifies, the provider may only provide the disclaimer regarding taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, as applicable.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>New comment 31(b)(1)(viii)-2 explains that § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) permits a provider to disclose the amount of any non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider.  For example, when a remittance transfer provider knows that the designated recipient's institution imposes a fee or that a foreign tax will apply, the provider may choose to disclose the relevant fee or tax as part of the information disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii).  The comment also notes that § 1005.32(b)(3) permits the provider to disclose estimated amounts of such taxes and fees, provided any estimates are based on reasonable source of information. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 32(b)(3)-1.  It further provides that where the provider chooses, at its option, to disclose the amounts of the relevant recipient institution fee or tax as part of the information disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii), the provider must not include that fee or tax in the amounts disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) or (b)(1)(vii).</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)-1 to the 2012 Final Rule provides examples of when certain disclosures may not be applicable and therefore need not be disclosed.  Because of the changes that the Bureau is making with respect to the disclosure of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider, the 2013 Final Rule makes certain revisions to the commentary in the 2012 Final Rule for consistency and clarification.  Comment 31(b)-1 clarifies that for disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(i) through (vii), a provider may disclose a term and state that an amount or item is “not applicable,” “N/A,” or “None.”  Consistent with the changes made in the 2013 Final Rule regarding the disclosure of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, comment 31(b)-1 is revised to state that if fees are not imposed or taxes are not collected in connection with a particular transaction the provider need not provide the disclosures about fees and taxes generally required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii), the disclosures about covered third-party fees generally required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), or the disclaimers about non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the provider generally required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii).</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisParagraph>As adopted by the 2012 Final Rule, comment 31(b)-2 states that terms used on the disclosures under §§ 1005.31(b)(1) and (2) may be more specific than the terms provided and notes, as an example, that a remittance transfer provider sending funds to Colombia may describe a tax disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) as a “Colombian Tax” in lieu of describing it as “Other Taxes.”  In light of the changes discussed below regarding the disclosure of foreign taxes, the 2013 Final Rule eliminates as an example the disclosure of a Colombian tax.  Instead, the 2013 Final Rule provides as an example that a provider sending funds may describe fees imposed by an agent at pick-up as “Pick-up Fees” in lieu of describing them as “Other Fees.”  In addition, in light of the new disclosures permitted by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) and § 1005.33(h)(3), the comment makes conforming changes to note that the foreign language disclosures required under § 1005.31(g) must contain accurate translations of the terms, language, and notices required by § 1005.31(b) or permitted by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) and § 1005.33(h)(3).</analysisParagraph>

            <title>Section 1005.35 Acts of Agents</title>
            <analysisParagraph>In most cases, remittance transfers are sent through an agent of the remittance transfer provider, such as a convenience store that has contracted with the provider to offer remittance transfer services at that location. EFTA section 919(f)(1) generally makes remittance transfer providers liable for any violation of EFTA section 919 by an agent, authorized delegate, or person affiliated with such provider, when such agent, authorized delegate, or affiliate acts for that remittance transfer provider. EFTA section 919(f)(2) requires the Bureau to prescribe rules to implement appropriate standards or conditions of liability of a remittance transfer provider, including one that acts through its agent or authorized delegate.<footnote ref="85">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See also&lt;/em&gt; § 1005.30(a), which defines the term “agent” for purposes of the rule.</footnote></analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed two alternatives to implement EFTA section 919(f) with respect to acts of agents. Under the first alternative (proposed Alternative A), a remittance transfer provider would be strictly liable for violations of subpart B by an agent when such agent acts for the provider. Under the second alternative (proposed Alternative B), a remittance transfer provider would be liable under the EFTA for violations by an agent acting for the provider, unless the provider establishes and maintains policies and procedures for agent compliance, including appropriate oversight measures, and the provider corrects any violation, to the extent appropriate.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Consumer groups, State regulators, and a Federal Reserve Bank supported proposed Alternative A. These commenters stated that Alternative A would provide the greatest incentives for remittance transfer providers to avoid errors and to oversee and audit their agents. Some argued that proposed Alternative A would be consistent with many State laws, and that adopting proposed Alternative B could disrupt efforts to hold providers to stricter liability standards under State law.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In contrast, industry commenters supported the liability standard set forth in proposed Alternative B. These commenters argued that proposed Alternative B would more appropriately address the unique position of agents in the market, while providing protection for consumers by making them whole for the cost of the remittance transfer. These commenters also stated that proposed Alternative B would create an incentive for providers to take an active role in developing compliance policies and procedures and engaging in agent oversight. These commenters also expressed concern about the liability risks associated with proposed Alternative A for the misconduct or a single agent or isolated violations, and that proposed Alternative A could discourage the use of agents.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Based on comments received and the Bureau's further analysis, the final rule adopts proposed Alternative A in renumbered § 1005.35. The Bureau believes that the approach taken in proposed Alternative A is more consistent with the approach generally taken in other Bureau regulations, including Regulation E. For example, under Regulation E's payroll card rules, a financial institution is required to provide initial payroll card disclosures to a payroll account holder. If, by contractual agreement with the institution, a third-party service provider or the employer agrees to deliver these disclosures on the institution's behalf and fails to do so, the issuing financial institution is nonetheless liable for the violation.<footnote ref="86">12 CFR 1005.18.</footnote>
              Similarly, if an agent at a retail establishment fails to provide the disclosures required by § 1005.31, the remittance transfer provider would be liable. The Bureau also believes that proposed Alternative A provides a greater incentive for providers to monitor their agents' activities and to exercise appropriate supervision and oversight than proposed Alternative B.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>One commenter suggested that proposed Alternative A could exculpate an agent from responsibility from its own conduct. However, nothing in the rule shields agents from liability, nor does it prevent providers from requiring specific agent conduct in their contracts or negotiating other contractual liability or indemnification clauses.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>With respect to commenters' concerns about liability risk, EFTA section 919(f)(2) states that enforcement agencies may consider, in any action or other proceeding against a remittance transfer provider, the extent to which the provider had established and maintained policies or procedures for compliance, including policies, procedures, or other appropriate oversight measures designed to assure compliance by an agent or authorized delegate acting for such provider. Thus, enforcement agencies are permitted to tailor any remedies in light of single agent non-compliance or isolated violations.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Several commenters requested further guidance on what it means for an agent to act for a provider. As discussed in the proposal, some agents have a non-exclusive arrangement with several remittance transfer providers, so that a sender may choose from among the remittance transfer providers at that agent location. If a sender chooses to use Provider A to send funds at the agent location, then Provider B would not be liable for the agent's actions in connection with that transaction, because the agent would be acting for Provider A. As noted above regarding the definition of “agent” under § 1005.30(a), the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to defer to State or other applicable law with respect to the relationship between an agent and Provider A.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The final rule also adopts proposed Alternative A's comment 35-1 substantially as proposed. Comment 35-1 explains that remittance transfer providers remain fully responsible for complying with the requirements of this subpart, including, but not limited to, providing the disclosures set forth in § 1005.31 and remedying any errors as set forth in § 1005.33. This is the case even if a remittance transfer provider performs its functions through an agent, and regardless of whether the provider has an agreement with a third party that transfers or otherwise makes funds available to a designated recipient.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>34(b) Time Limits and Refund Requirements</title>
            <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.34(b) established the time frames and refund requirements applicable to remittance transfer cancellation requests. The proposed rule stated that a remittance transfer provider must refund, at no additional cost to the sender, the total amount of funds tendered by the sender in connection with the remittance transfer, including any fees imposed in connection with the requested transfer, within three business days of receiving the sender's valid cancellation request.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters objected to the requirement in the May 2011 Proposed Rule to refund the total amount of funds to the sender. Industry commenters believed that requiring a refund of the total amount of funds raised significant safety and soundness concerns for institutions sending wire transfers because some remittance transfer providers would be unable to recover the funds from subsequent institutions in a transfer chain. One money transmitter commenter stated that once a transfer is booked at an agent location, the provider is obligated to pay the agent its portion of the transfer fees for the transaction. If a sender cancels the transaction after settlement, the provider would be required to negotiate the return of the fee from the agent or bear the total loss of the fee. Similarly, the commenter noted that it acted as an agent of international billers and is obligated to the billers for the funds when it sends data to the biller. Several industry commenters believed requiring a remittance transfer provider to refund all fees could increase costs for senders, since providers may increase fees to account for losses due to refund. A money transmitter commenter also argued that refunding a third party fee or tax could be impermissible under local law.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters suggested that the Bureau permit a remittance transfer provider to charge reasonable fees, even if the sender cancels the transaction. Some of the commenters noted that this was consistent with a bank's ability to charge fees in connection with a stop payment order on a check to cover the bank's costs. An industry trade association believed providers should be permitted to charge a $45 fee to stop the transaction. Another industry commenter suggested that if the exchange rate changes between the time the order is placed and the refund is requested such that the amount of local currency originally promised would be equivalent to less U.S. dollars, the refund of the principal should be at the new exchange rate.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Some commenters believed a remittance transfer provider should not be required to provide a refund in certain circumstances. One industry commenter believed a provider should not be required to refund fees charged by intermediaries. Another industry commenter suggested that a provider should not have to refund the portion of any fees that are not attributable to costs incurred by them prior to receiving a cancellation request. A trade association believed a provider should not be required to refund fees when the provider has not made any errors.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes it is appropriate to require a provider to refund the total amount of funds provided by the sender in connection with the remittance transfer. The Bureau believes senders could be discouraged from exercising their cancellation rights if they could not recover the cost of the remittance transfer. Although the Bureau recognizes that a provider may not be able to recover some fees or taxes charged for a transfer, the Bureau believes that the shorter cancellation period adopted in the final rule helps address these concerns. Under the final rule, a provider can mitigate some of the risk of losing fees or taxes charged for a transfer by sending a transfer after the 30-minute cancellation period ends. Therefore, the Bureau is requiring the total amount of funds provided by the sender to be refunded in the final rule in § 1005.34(b) with the additional clarification that refunding the total amount of funds provided by the sender in connection with a remittance transfer requires a provider to refund taxes on the remittance transfer. However, as noted by one industry commenter, for certain jurisdictions, the remittance transfer provider may be prohibited by law from refunding taxes. Consequently, the requirement in § 1005.34(b) to refund taxes is only to the extent such refund is not prohibited by law. In the final rule, § 1005.34(b) provides that a remittance transfer provider shall refund, at no additional cost to the sender, the total amount of funds provided by the sender in connection with a remittance transfer, including any fees and, to the extent not prohibited by law, taxes imposed in connection with the remittance transfer, within three business days of receiving a sender's request to cancel the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 34(b)-1 addressed the permissible ways in which a provider could provide a refund. The proposed comment clarified that a remittance transfer provider may, at the provider's discretion, issue a refund in cash or in the same form of payment that was initially tendered by the sender for the remittance transfer. For example, if the sender originally provided a credit card as payment for the transfer, the remittance transfer provider may issue a credit to the sender's credit card account in the amount of the payment.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comment on proposed comment 34(b)-1. However, as discussed above regarding comment 33(c)-6, the Bureau is amending comment 34(b)-1 with respect to refunds if a sender initially provided cash for the remittance transfer. Specifically, comment 34(b)-1 states that a provider may issue a refund by check if a sender initially provided cash for the remittance transfer. For example, if the sender originally provided cash as payment for the transfer, the provider may mail a check to the sender in the amount of the payment.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also finalizing comment 34(b)-2, which addresses costs that must be refunded upon a sender's timely request to cancel a remittance transfer. The comment is adopted substantially as proposed, with amendments clarifying that all funds provided by the sender in connection with the remittance transfer would include taxes that are assessed by a State or other governmental body, to the extent not prohibited by law. Therefore, the final comment states that if a sender provides a timely request to cancel a remittance transfer, a remittance transfer provider must refund all funds provided by the sender in connection with the remittance transfer, including any fees and, to the extent not prohibited by law, taxes that have been imposed for the transfer, whether the fee or tax was assessed by the provider or a third party, such as an intermediary institution, the agent or bank in the recipient country, or a State or other governmental body.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Finally, industry commenters suggested amendments to the requirement in the proposal to provide a refund within three business days of receiving a sender's request to cancel the remittance transfer. One industry commenter believed the refund rule should not require the refund to be delivered to the sender within three business days. The commenter cited examples of when it could be difficult to deliver the funds to the sender in three days, such as when the provider mails a refund check and the check takes several days to be delivered to the sender; when the refund is available at an agent location, but the sender takes several days to pick-up the refund; and when the provider issues a chargeback to the sender's credit or debit card account, but the credit takes several days to appear due to card processing systems. The Bureau notes that the requirement to refund funds to a sender does not require a provider to ensure that a refund is delivered to a sender within three business days after receiving the sender's request to cancel the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>36(a) Timing</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.36(a) sets forth the disclosure timing requirements for disclosures relating to preauthorized remittance transfers. Under § 1005.36(a)(1), for the first scheduled transfer, the provider is required to provide both the pre-payment disclosure described in § 1005.31(b)(1) and the receipt described in § 1005.31(b)(2) in accordance with the timing rules set forth in § 1005.31(e) that generally apply to remittance transfers. In effect, under the final rule, the first scheduled transfer of a preauthorized remittance transfer is treated the same as other individual transfer requests by a sender.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>However, under § 1005.36(a)(2), different timing requirements apply to disclosures relating to subsequent scheduled transfers. Under § 1005.36(a)(2)(i), the provider must mail or deliver a pre-payment disclosure, as described in § 1005.31(b)(1), within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of each subsequent transfer. If the general timing rule in § 1005.31(e) applied, the provider would be required to provide a pre-payment disclosure at the time the scheduled payments are authorized. By requiring a pre-payment disclosure at this alternative time for each subsequent transfer, senders will receive information about their transfers in closer proximity to the scheduled transfer date, and the provider should be in a better position to make the required disclosures. This approach also reminds senders about the pending transfer, which will enable them to confirm that sufficient funds are available for the transfer. In the January 2012 Proposed Rule published elsewhere in today's <em data-original="E-04">Federal Register</em>, the Bureau is also soliciting comment on a safe harbor with respect to the reasonable time requirement.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In addition, under § 1005.36(a)(2)(ii), the provider must provide the receipt described in § 1005.31(b)(2) for each subsequent transfer. As with pre-payment disclosures, the Bureau does not believe a receipt given at the time payment for the transfer is authorized would be as useful to senders as a receipt received closer in time to the actual transfer that contains more relevant information about the particular scheduled transfer. The final rule requires the receipt to be mailed or delivered to the sender no later than one business day after the date on which the transfer is made. However, if the transfer involves the transfer of funds from the sender's account held by the provider, the receipt may be provided on or with the next regularly scheduled periodic statement for that account or within 30 days after payment is made for the remittance transfer if a periodic statement is not provided. Section 1005.36(a)(2)(ii) closely tracks the receipt timing rule for receipts in transactions conducted entirely by telephone under § 1005.31(e)(2).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that these special timing rules for pre-payment disclosures and receipts for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers will result in more meaningful disclosures to senders than if providers were required to provide these disclosures at the time the transfers were authorized.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.36(b) sets forth requirements for the accuracy of disclosures for preauthorized remittance transfers. For the first scheduled transfer, the disclosure requirements follow the accuracy rule set forth in § 1005.31(f) that generally applies to remittance transfers. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.36(b)(1). Thus, except as permitted by § 1005.32, the pre-payment disclosure and receipt provided for the first scheduled transfer must be accurate when payment is made; that is, at the time the transfer is authorized.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>However, for subsequent scheduled transfers, the disclosures described in § 1005.36(a)(2) must be accurate when the transfer is made. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.36(b)(2). Thus, for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers, the final rule provides that senders must receive an accurate pre-payment disclosure shortly before the transfer is made, and then an accurate receipt shortly after the transfer is made. Providers may continue to disclose estimates to the extent permitted by § 1005.32.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau believes that it would be problematic to apply the general rule about accuracy in § 1005.31(f) to subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. For example, some preauthorized remittance transfers are set up to vary in amount, so the provider cannot predict, at the time such transfers are authorized, the amount to be transferred in subsequent months. Therefore, the provider could not provide an accurate pre-payment disclosure and receipt at the time the preauthorized remittance transfers, and payment for the transfers, are authorized. The accuracy requirement in § 1005.31(f) also would present a challenge to determining an applicable exchange rate for subsequent transfers, in that the provider may not know the exchange rate that will apply to subsequent transfers at the time of authorization. Accordingly, to effectuate the purposes of the Act and to facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to adopt special requirements for accurate disclosures about subsequent scheduled transfers in § 1005.36(b). In the January 2012 Proposed Rule published elsewhere in today's <em data-original="E-04">Federal Register</em>, the Bureau is also soliciting comment on the use of estimates for certain disclosures with respect to the first scheduled transfer.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>36(c) Cancellation</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Under § 1005.34(a), senders are permitted to cancel a remittance transfer if the request to cancel the remittance transfer is received by the provider no later than 30 minutes after the sender makes payment in connection with the remittance transfer, if certain conditions are met. As noted above, for purposes of subpart B, payment is made when payment is authorized. The Bureau believes that requiring a sender to cancel a transaction no later than 30 minutes after payment is authorized would not be appropriate for certain remittance transfers that a sender schedules in advance, including preauthorized remittance transfers. Such a rule would permit cancellation only for a short time after the transfers are authorized, even though the remittance transfer may not occur for many days, weeks, or months. For example, if on March 1 a sender scheduled a remittance transfer for March 23, under the general cancellation rule, the sender would be required to cancel 30 minutes after the transfer was authorized on March 1, despite the fact that the transfer is not being made until March 23. The Bureau believes it is appropriate to adopt a different cancellation period in these circumstances because payment is authorized well before the transfer is to be made.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Consequently, the Bureau is adopting a special cancellation rule in § 1005.36(c) that it believes is more appropriate for these types of transfers. Section 1005.36(c) states that, for any remittance transfer scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, a remittance transfer provider shall comply with any oral or written request to cancel the remittance transfer from the sender if the request to cancel: (i) Enables the provider to identify the sender's name and address or telephone number and the particular transfer to be cancelled; and (ii) is received by the provider at least three business days before the scheduled date of the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that this time period is more beneficial to senders because it generally provides them more time to decide whether to go through with a scheduled transfer. Senders will have the opportunity to change their minds about sending a transfer if, for example, circumstances change between when the transfer is authorized and when the transfer is to be made. At the same time, the Bureau believes that requiring a sender to cancel at least three days before a transfer is made gives providers sufficient time to process any cancellation requests before a transfer is made. Many financial institutions that permit senders to schedule remittance transfers at least three business days before the date of the transfer are already subject to the stop payment provisions in Regulation E for preauthorized transfers that are EFTs, which require consumers to notify the institution at least three business days before the scheduled date of a preauthorized EFT. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.10(c).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The cancellation provisions in both §§ 1005.34(a) and 1005.36(c) permit a sender to cancel a remittance transfer after the transfer has been authorized. Under both provisions, a cancellation period may expire before the transfer itself is made. As noted above, the Bureau expects financial institutions making transfers by ACH or wire transfer may decide to wait to execute the payment order until the cancellation period has passed because these types of remittance transfers generally cannot easily be cancelled once the payment order has been accepted by the sending institution. For the same reason, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to require a sender to cancel before a transfer is made in § 1005.36(c).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Under § 1005.36(c), a transfer must be cancelled only if the request to cancel is received by the provider at least three business days before the scheduled date of the remittance transfer, so that a provider has sufficient time to prevent the transfer from taking place on the scheduled date. Therefore, under the final rule, only transfers scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer are subject to the cancellation requirements in § 1005.36(c). Remittance transfers that are scheduled less than three business days before the date of the transfer are subject to the cancellation requirements in § 1005.34(a). For example, if a sender on March 1 requests a remittance transfer provider to send a wire transfer to pay a bill in a foreign country on March 3, the sender may cancel up to 30 minutes after scheduling the payment on March 1. Thus, in every case, a sender has an opportunity to cancel a remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting commentary to provide further guidance on the application of § 1005.36(c). Comment 36(c)-1 clarifies that a remittance transfer is scheduled if it will require no further action by the sender to send the transfer after the sender requests the transfer. For example, a remittance transfer is scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, and § 1005.36(c) applies, where a sender on March 1 requests a remittance transfer provider to send a wire transfer to pay a bill in a foreign country on March 15, if it will require no further action by the sender to send the transfer after the sender requests the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Comment 36(c)-1 also clarifies three circumstances where the provisions of § 1005.36(c) do not apply, such that a provider should instead comply with the 30-minute cancellation rule in § 1005.34. For example, § 1005.36(c) does not apply when a sender on March 1 requests a remittance transfer provider to send a wire transfer to pay a bill in a foreign country on March 3. In this instance, § 1005.36(c) does not apply because the transfer is scheduled less than three business days before the date of the transfer. Section 1005.36(c) also does not apply when a sender on March 1 requests that a remittance transfer provider send a remittance transfer on March 15, but the provider requires the sender to confirm the request on March 14 in order to send the transfer. In this example, § 1005.36(c) does not apply because the transfer requires further action by the sender to send the transfer after the sender requests the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The other example in comment 36(c)-1 demonstrates situations where § 1005.36(c) does not apply because a transfer occurs more than three days after the date the sender requests the transfer solely due to the provider's processing time and not because a sender schedules the transfer at least three business days before the date of the transfer. For example, § 1005.36(c) does not apply when a sender on March 1 requests that a remittance transfer provider send an ACH transfer, and that transfer is sent on March 2, but due to the time required for processing, funds are not deducted from the sender's account until March 5.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Comment 36(c)-2 clarifies how a remittance transfer provider should treat requests to cancel preauthorized remittance transfers in a manner consistent with the stop payment provisions of Regulation E. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.10(c) and comment 10(c)-2. The comment clarifies that for preauthorized remittance transfers, the provider must assume the request to cancel applies to all future preauthorized remittance transfers, unless the sender specifically indicates that it should apply only to the next scheduled remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Finally, comment 36(c)-3 clarifies that a financial institution that is also a remittance transfer provider may have both stop payment obligations under § 1005.10 and cancellation obligations under § 1005.36. If a sender cancels a remittance transfer under § 1005.36 with a remittance transfer provider that holds the sender's account, and the transfer is a preauthorized transfer under § 1005.10, then the cancellation provisions of § 1005.36 exclusively apply. The Bureau notes that in these circumstances, a provider would not be permitted to require the sender to give written confirmation of a cancellation within 14 days of an oral notification, as is permitted for stop payment orders in § 1005.10(c)(2). The Bureau believes that a sender should be able to orally cancel any remittance transfer, including a remittance transfer that is scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, without the additional burden of providing written confirmation of the cancellation.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In the January 2012 Proposed Rule published elsewhere in today's <em data-original="E-04">Federal Register</em>, the Bureau is also soliciting comment on the cancellation period for a remittance transfer scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>Section 1005.36 Transfers Scheduled in Advance</title>
            <analysisParagraph>As discussed above in connection with the § 1005.30(e) definition of “remittance transfer,” the Board requested comment on whether the rule should exclude from coverage online bill payments, including preauthorized transfers. As noted above, most industry commenters argued that these transfers should be excluded from the final rule. These commenters argued that the provider would not be in a position to know, at the time disclosures are required, the applicable exchange rate for transfers that are scheduled to be sent at a later date.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>For the reasons discussed above in the supplementary information to § 1005.30(e), the final rule does not exclude online bill payments from the definition of “remittance transfer,” nor does it exclude certain other remittance transfers that a sender schedules in advance, including preauthorized remittance transfers. Thus, the final rule generally requires that disclosures be provided in accordance with the timing and accuracy rules set forth in § 1005.31, both with respect to the required pre-payment disclosure and the required receipt. Estimates may be disclosed, to the extent permitted by § 1005.32.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>However, the Bureau believes that preauthorized remittance transfers, whether for bill payments or for other reasons, raise issues relating to the practical aspects of compliance, and potential consumer confusion issues. As discussed above, § 1005.31(e) links the timing requirements for providing pre-payment disclosures and receipts to senders to the time when the transfer is requested and payment is made by the sender. Similarly, the disclosure accuracy rule in § 1005.31(f) relates to when the sender's payment is made. For purposes of subpart B, payment is made when payment is authorized. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comments 31(e)-2 and 34(a)-5. Accordingly, if all preauthorized remittance transfers were subject to § 1005.31, providers would have to provide both pre-payment disclosures and receipts at the time the preauthorized remittance transfers are requested and authorized by the sender. Moreover, these disclosures would need to be accurate for the first and all subsequent transfers scheduled in the future (except to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32).</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that in some circumstances, it is impracticable for providers to provide accurate disclosures for subsequent transfers at the time preauthorized remittance transfers are authorized. For example, while a provider may be able to know or to hedge for a specified exchange rate with respect to the first transfer, the provider or the institution involved in the remittance transfer that sets the exchange rate may be reluctant to set a specified exchange rate applicable to all subsequent transfers that are scheduled to be made into the future. This reluctance could arise due to the risk associated with participating in foreign exchange markets, and the manners in which providers and their partners manage such risk. Many wholesale exchange rates are set largely through currency markets in which rates can fluctuate frequently.<footnote ref="87">Some foreign exchange rates are set by monetary authorities. There are a variety of business models that providers use to fund transfers that are received in foreign currency. The timing of when foreign currency is purchased, the role of the provider in such a purchase, and the role of other intermediaries, partners, agents, and other parties can vary.</footnote>
              As a result, whenever there are time lags in between the time when the retail rate applied to a transfer is set, the time when the relevant foreign currency is purchased, and the time when funds are delivered, a provider (and/or its business partner) may face losses due to unexpected changes in the value of the relevant foreign currency.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Providers and/or their partners generally use a variety of pricing, business processes, or hedging techniques to manage or minimize this exchange rate risk. For some, and perhaps many providers (or their partners), the task of managing or minimizing exchange risk may become more complicated or more costly if the amount of time between when the rate is set for a customer and when the transfer is sent increases. Setting the retail rate that applies to a transfer far in advance of when that transfer is sent may require the provider or other parties involved in processing the remittance transfer to use additional or more sophisticated risk management tools.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Some preauthorized remittance transfers may be set up to vary in amount (for example, based on the amount of a utilities bill). In such cases, while the remittance transfer provider may know the amount to be transferred in the first payment, the provider may not know, at the time the sender authorizes the preauthorized remittance transfer, the amounts that will be transferred in subsequent months. Moreover, even if the scheduled amounts to be transferred were fixed, and a provider were permitted to disclose an estimated exchange rate for future payments, providing estimated exchange rates at the time of the initial request for transfers beyond the first transfer may not be useful to senders—and could even be misleading—because currency fluctuations over several months could cause the actual rate applied to particular transfers to vary substantially. The Bureau recognizes that the market for preauthorized remittance transfers is still developing. Consequently, the Bureau is concerned that if providers were required to provide accurate disclosures for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers at the time those transfers are authorized, in many cases providers would not be able to offer preauthorized remittance transfer products, which could limit consumer access to a potentially valuable product.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also believes that the right to cancel a remittance transfer no later than 30 minutes after the sender makes payment as provided in § 1005.34(a) is not appropriate when applied to certain remittance transfers that a sender schedules in advance, including preauthorized remittance transfers. When a sender schedules a remittance transfer many days—or even months—in advance of when the transfer is to be made, a sender should have the flexibility to cancel the transfer more than 30 minutes after requesting the transfer, given the delay between when the sender authorizes the remittance transfer and when the sender schedules the remittance transfer to be made. In such circumstances, the Bureau believes that remittance transfer providers can accommodate a longer cancellation period without the risk that a sender's cancellation would delay the remittance transfer. Thus, the Bureau believes that a cancellation period tied to when the transfer is made, rather than when the transfer is authorized, is more beneficial to senders.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and to facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to adopt a new § 1005.36, which sets forth disclosure requirements specifically applicable to preauthorized remittance transfers, as well as specific cancellation requirements for any remittance transfer scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer. Section 1005.36(a) and (b) address specific requirements for the timing and accuracy of disclosures for preauthorized remittance transfers. Section 1005.36(c) addresses the cancellation requirements applicable to any remittance transfer scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, including preauthorized remittance transfers. Because § 1005.36 only addresses timing, accuracy, and cancellation requirements, the other requirements of subpart B, such as content and formatting requirements and the foreign language requirements, continue to apply to remittance transfers subject to § 1005.36. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 36-1.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau's January 2012 Proposed Rule, published elsewhere in the Federal Register today, solicits comment on alternative disclosure and cancellation requirements with respect to remittance transfers subject to § 1005.36.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>Section 1005.36 Transfers Scheduled Before the Date of Transfer</title>
            <analysisSection>
              <title>Overview</title>
              <analysisParagraph>The February Final Rule sets forth several procedures for the timing, content, and accuracy of pre-payment disclosures and receipts for preauthorized remittance transfers. At the same time, the February Proposal sought comment on whether further adjustments were necessary to address one-time transfers scheduled before the date of transfer and preauthorized remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Specifically, the February Final Rule treats the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers the same as most other remittance transfers by requiring that accurate (not estimated) figures be disclosed in the pre-payment disclosure and receipt. But in recognition of the potential risks associated with setting exchange rates and the potential difficulty of determining the amount to be provided to a designated recipient weeks or months before subsequent transfers, the February Final Rule does not require that disclosures for an entire series of preauthorized remittance transfers be provided when the sender initially requests the transfer and authorizes payment. Instead, the February Final Rule requires remittance transfer providers to issue pre-payment disclosures and receipts for each subsequent transfer closer to the dates of the individual transfers. In particular, under the February Final Rule, the pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent transfer must be provided within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of the transfer, and the receipt for each subsequent transfer generally must be provided no later than one business day after the date on which the transfer is made. The pre-payment disclosure and receipt for each subsequent transfer must be accurate when the respective transfer is made, unless a statutory exception applies. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.36(b). Senders must also be permitted to cancel these transfers up to three business days before the date of transfer. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.36(c).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Because the Bureau was concerned that even with the modifications permitted by the February Final Rule, the disclosure requirements could pose difficulty for certain remittance transfers scheduled significantly before the date of transfer, the February Proposal asked a number of questions regarding whether to make further adjustments to the disclosure and cancellation regime for these transfers. The Bureau sought input on how to manage the importance to senders of accurate and timely disclosures, permit growth of this portion of the remittance transfer market, and limit industry compliance burdens in light of the potential risks associated with providing accurate exchange rates and the difficulty of determining the amount to be received by designated recipients for a particular transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Specifically, the February Proposal sought comments on a number of potential changes to the February Final Rule concerning the type, timing, and accuracy of pre-payment disclosures and receipts a sender should receive in connection with one-time transfers and the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers scheduled to occur more than ten days before the date of transfer. The February Proposal also sought comment on whether senders should receive disclosures for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers and, if so, what form those disclosures should take. Finally, the February Proposal sought comment on what cancellation rules should apply to these transactions and how and when those rules should be disclosed to senders.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Based on comments received, the Bureau is amending the February Final Rule to allow providers increased flexibility, while maintaining requirements that senders receive sufficient and timely information to help inform their selection of remittance transfer providers and help them understand the terms of their remittance transfers. With respect to timing, the final rule requires pre-payment disclosures and receipts for one-time transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer and the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers to be provided in the same manner as they are provided for all other transfers (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> at request and at payment authorization). The final rule also requires providers to give senders additional, accurate receipts after the transfer is sent if prior disclosures contained estimates pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2). The Bureau is also maintaining the three-business-day cancellation period in § 1005.36(c). Finally, although the Bureau is generally eliminating the requirement to provide pre-payment disclosures for subsequent remittance transfers in a preauthorized series, the Bureau is adopting a new § 1005.36(d) to require disclosure of upcoming dates of transfer and cancellation provisions a reasonable time before the dates of such transfers.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>36(a) Timing</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.36(a) of the February Final Rule addresses the timing of disclosures for the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers. In the February Proposal, the Bureau sought comment on a number of questions relating to the timing of disclosures for all remittance transfers that are scheduled more than ten days before the date of transfer, including preauthorized remittance transfers, as described below.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As is discussed further below, to further the purposes of the EFTA and facilitate compliance, the Bureau finds it necessary and proper to use its EFTA section 904(a) and (c) authority to adopt § 1005.36(a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii), and (a)(2)(i) through (iii) and to eliminate the requirement to provide pre-payment disclosures for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. Sections 1005.36(a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii), (a)(2)(i), and (a)(2)(ii) are revised from the February Final Rule. Section 1005.36(a)(2)(iii) is a new provision in the final rule.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>36(a)(1) Timing of Disclosures for One-Time Transfers Scheduled Before the Date of Transfer and the First in a Series of Preauthorized Remittance Transfers</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.36(a) of the February Final Rule addresses the timing of required disclosures for preauthorized remittance transfers. Section 1005.36(a)(1) of the February Final Rule requires that, for the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the pre-payment disclosure and receipt be provided in the same manner as required for all other transfers. In the February Proposal, the Bureau sought comment on whether to make further adjustments in the disclosure rules for preauthorized remittance transfers and certain other transfers scheduled before the date of transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>With respect to the timing of pre-payment disclosures and receipts given to senders upon request of and payment for a transfer, the Bureau received few comments, apart from those raising the concerns discussed earlier regarding the disclosure of exact exchange rates far before the date of a remittance transfer. Largely, industry commenters did not raise other concerns about the requirement that remittance transfer providers give pre-payment disclosures (or combined disclosures) when transfers are requested and prior to payment and receipts (if no combined disclosures were provided) when payment is authorized for either one-time transfers scheduled before the date of transfer or the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers. In the final rule, the Bureau maintains the requirement from the February Final Rule that for any one-time remittance transfer scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer, and for the first transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, a remittance transfer provider must provide a pre-payment disclosure and a receipt to the sender subject to the same timing rules that apply to any one-time transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>For clarity and consistency, the Bureau is revising § 1005.36(a)(1) from the February Final Rule as a new § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) by adjusting the provision to apply both to a one-time advance transfer scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer and the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, rather than just the latter. The Bureau is also clarifying that remittance transfer providers may use combined disclosures, pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(3), for transfers covered by this provision.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also requested comment on what follow-up disclosures, if any, should be provided to senders after authorization of a remittance transfer scheduled before the date of transfer. Specifically the Bureau asked whether a second receipt with accurate information should be provided to a sender within a reasonable time period prior to such a transfer, if the remittance transfer provider previously disclosed estimates pursuant to proposed § 1005.32(b)(2).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Most industry commenters argued against requiring a second receipt with accurate figures to be given prior to a remittance transfer when the original pre-payment disclosure and receipt contained estimates. These commenters argued that to the extent such a provision required disclosure of accurate figures ten days before the date of transfer, it would render the exception allowing providers to disclose estimates meaningless.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>To the extent the Bureau would instead allow a second receipt to contain estimates, industry commenters argued that giving senders three documents (a pre-payment disclosure when requesting the remittance transfer, a receipt when payment is authorized for the transfer, and a second receipt a reasonable time before the transfer) would be confusing and unhelpful to senders. One industry commenter suggested there would be limited value added by a second receipt that could contain information that, other than updated estimated exchange rates and associated figures, would be identical to the information included in the initial receipt. Another commenter expressed concern that a sender could be confused into thinking that a remittance transfer provider has made a single transfer multiple times or that an error had occurred, necessitating the additional disclosure. Industry commenters also stated that they thought senders would benefit little from additional disclosures before a transfer, particularly when any such benefit is balanced against the increased upfront and ongoing costs to the remittance transfer providers of giving senders the additional receipt. These commenters argued that providers would pass these costs on to senders. Finally, as an alternative to a second pre-transfer receipt, one industry commenter suggested that providers give senders receipts reflecting actual figures (and not estimates) after the providers send the transfers to the designated recipient. Consumer group commenters argued that receipts with actual figures (and not estimates) be provided to senders a reasonable time prior to the date of each transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In light of the Bureau's decision to allow the use of estimates in certain disclosures for remittance transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of a remittance transfer rather than ten days as originally proposed, the Bureau believes that a follow-up receipt provided closer to the date of the transfer is not likely to provide significant benefit to senders in many cases. For example, if a remittance transfer provider schedules a remittance transfer one month before the date of transfer, and discloses an estimated exchange rate at that time, and then provides a sender a receipt with an accurate exchange rate only four business days before the date of transfer (because unless a statutory exception applies, § 1005.32(b)(2) of the final rule permits estimates only for disclosures five or more business days before the date of transfer) the receipt might not reach the sender before the expiration of the three-business-day cancellation period in § 1005.36(c). Conversely, if this follow-up receipt were sent five or more business days before the date of transfer, estimates of certain amounts would be permitted under § 1005.32(b)(2). The Bureau believes that such a disclosure generally would be of little additional value as compared to the initial estimate provided in the pre-payment disclosure and receipt required by § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) if the wholesale rate, and thus the retail rate, had not moved significantly since the initial estimate was provided.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Although the Bureau is not requiring a second receipt closer to the time of transfer, the Bureau believes that for every remittance transfer, where a sender receives a disclosure that contains estimates pursuant to § 1005.32, the sender should also receive an accurate post-transfer disclosure that informs the sender of the actual exchange rate (as well as fees, taxes, and other figures) applied to the transfer. Thus, to further consumer protections, the Bureau is adopting a revised § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii), which requires that if the disclosures provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) contain estimates as permitted by § 1005.32(b)(2) (for transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer), the provider must mail or deliver to the sender an additional receipt meeting the requirements described in § 1005.31(b)(2) no later than one business day after the date of transfer.<footnote ref="17">The timing requirement in § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) does not prevent a remittance transfer provider from providing this receipt before the date of the transfer. The same is true for disclosures required by § 1005.36(a)(2)(ii), which are discussed below.</footnote>
                If the transfer involves the transfer of funds from the sender's account held by the provider, the receipt required by § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) may be provided on or with the next periodic statement for that account, or within 30 days after the date of the transfer if a periodic statement is not provided. As required by § 1005.36(b)(3), which is discussed below, this receipt must contain accurate figures unless estimates are allowed by § 1005.32(a) or (b)(1).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As many remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer are conducted by senders who have accounts with remittance transfer providers, the Bureau believes the final rule may relieve many providers of having to provide receipts immediately after each preauthorized remittance transfer or after one-time transfer scheduled five or more business days before the date of the transfer. In addition, the Bureau believes that an accurate receipt will ensure that senders receive accurate accountings of their transfers. Furthermore, to the extent that senders of preauthorized remittance transfers want to comparison shop based on price for future transfers, these receipts may be a mechanism that allows senders to better understand providers' pricing mechanisms (by allowing a sender to know the exchange rate applied to each transfer) and the amount received by the designated recipient.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>36(a)(2) Timing of Disclosures for Subsequent Preauthorized Remittance Transfers</title>
              <analysisParagraph>The February Final Rule contains disclosure provisions specific to subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> all preauthorized remittance transfers after the first in the series of transfers). Section 1005.36(a)(2)(i) of the February Final Rule requires that a remittance transfer provider also mail or deliver a pre-payment disclosure to the sender for each subsequent transfer and requires the disclosure to be mailed or delivered within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of each subsequent transfer. This provision is in lieu of the general timing rule, which would have required that a pre-payment disclosure for each transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers be given at the time of the initial request (and thus a sender would receive a disclosure for every preauthorized transfer when requesting the entire series). <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(e)(1). Section 1005.36(a)(2)(ii) in the February Final Rule requires a receipt to be mailed or delivered no later than one business day after the transfer or, for account-based transactions, on or with the next regularly scheduled periodic statement or within 30 days after payment is made for the remittance transfer if a periodic statement is not provided.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In the February Proposal, the Bureau sought comment on an alternative to the requirement in the February Final Rule that a pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfer be provided within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of transfer: Whether the pre-payment disclosure requirement for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers should be eliminated.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters generally favored eliminating the requirement for providing pre-payment disclosures for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers for many of the same reasons these commenters disfavored a rule requiring accurate pre-payment disclosures for other transfers scheduled before the date of transfer. These commenters argued that a pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent transfer would be unnecessary, potentially confusing to senders, and burdensome to providers. For example, one commenter argued that senders schedule preauthorized remittance transfers for purposes of convenience and that senders typically do not comparison shop to complete each recurring transfer. The same commenter expressed concern that the requirement of an additional pre-payment disclosure might cause some providers to no longer allow consumers to schedule transfers before the date of transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In contrast, one consumer group commenter supported requiring pre-payment disclosures to be provided to senders ten days before each subsequent transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers (and stated that if estimates were permitted for disclosures related to such transfers, that those disclosures contain current estimates). This commenter urged that the Bureau maintain the requirement in the February Final Rule for pre-payment disclosures so that senders have additional information regarding the details of each preauthorized remittance transfer prior to such transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Upon consideration of these comments and to facilitate compliance, the Bureau is eliminating the requirement to provide a pre-payment disclosure within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer. Thus, the Bureau is eliminating what was § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) in the February Final Rule. The Bureau is doing so for several reasons. The Bureau is concerned that the requirement in the February Final Rule—a pre-payment disclosure sent a reasonable time prior to each subsequent remittance transfer—might provide senders only a limited amount of information because pre-payment disclosures for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers sent five or more business days before the date of transfer could contain estimates, pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2). In addition, in some scenarios, this could create a potential for confusing and overlapping disclosures and receipts.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Conversely, the Bureau believes that if it mandated that pre-payment disclosures be sent less than five business days before a subsequent transfer such that the disclosures could not contain estimates under § 1005.32(b)(2), the disclosure would be of little use to the sender for the upcoming transfer as it could be received too close to (or after) the cancellation deadline. Separately, confusion for senders could exist in some circumstances where preauthorized remittance transfers are scheduled relatively close together or receipts are provided with periodic statements. In these cases, a sender might receive a post-transfer receipt from a prior preauthorized remittance transfer close in time to a pre-payment disclosure for the next transfer. These documents, with potentially differing exchange rates and other figures, might confuse senders unnecessarily.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also believes that eliminating the requirement for pre-payment disclosures for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers is appropriate in part because senders will receive some relevant information in receipts for prior preauthorized remittance transfers. The final rule requires that for any preauthorized remittance transfer, the remittance transfer provider must provide a sender a receipt with accurate information (except to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32(a) or (b)(1)). A receipt from the prior transfer with accurate amounts may provide the sender with information that could educate the sender not only about the prior transfer but also about the provider's practices generally, which may help the sender judge whether to continue with the provider for future preauthorized remittance transfers. The Bureau believes a sender can learn about a remittance transfer provider's exchange rate practices from what the designated recipient actually received from the prior transfers in the series. In addition, the receipt provided for the initial transfer in a series provides information about the fees and taxes that will apply to all subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers, unless a change necessitates a new disclosure, as discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Although the Bureau is eliminating the requirement that a remittance transfer provider provide a pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the Bureau remains concerned that previously disclosed figures (other than the estimates themselves) could change, rendering the figures disclosed in the pre-payment disclosure provided for the initial transfer inaccurate as applied to the subsequent transfers.<footnote ref="18">Although changes in terms trigger notice requirements in some instances under Regulation E (&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; 12 CFR 1005.10), that provision does not apply to remittance transfers that are not electronic fund transfers.</footnote>
                Comment 31(f)-1 to the February Final Rule explains that under the general timing and accuracy rules in subpart B of Regulation E, providers must give senders new pre-payment disclosures before accepting payment if previously provided pre-payment disclosures are inaccurate. However, since a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or, as discussed below, .36(a)(2)(i), may serve as a disclosure with respect to multiple subsequent preauthorized transfers, the temporal elements disclosed on those receipts would only be accurate with respect to the transfer to occur after the receipt is provided.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Thus, the Bureau is adopting a new § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) to specifically address certain changes in terms related to subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. Section 1005.36(a)(2)(i) states that if any of the information on the most recent receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or § 1005.36(a)(2)(i), other than the temporal disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) (Date Available) and (b)(2)(vii) (Transfer Date), is no longer accurate with respect to a subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer for reasons other than as permitted by § 1005.32, then the remittance transfer provider must provide an updated receipt meeting the requirements described in § 1005.31(b)(2) to the sender. The provider must mail or deliver this receipt to the sender within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of the next subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer. Such receipt must clearly and conspicuously indicate that it contains updated disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>New comment 36(a)(2)-1 clarifies when the disclosure required by § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) must be provided. Specifically, it states that when a sender schedules a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the provider is generally not required to provide a pre-payment disclosure prior to the date of each subsequent transfer. However, § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) requires the provider to provide a pre-payment disclosure and receipt for the first in the series of preauthorized remittance transfers in accordance with the timing requirements set forth in § 1005.31(e). <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.36(a)(1)(i). While certain information in those disclosures is expressly permitted to be estimated (<em data-original="E-03">see</em> § 1005.32(b)(2)(i) through (iii)), other information is not permitted to be estimated, or is limited in how it may be estimated. When any of the information on the most recent receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i), other than the temporal disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) (the Date Available) and (b)(2)(vii) (the Transfer Date), is no longer accurate with respect to a subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer for reasons other than as permitted by § 1005.32, the provider must provide, within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of the next preauthorized remittance transfer, a receipt that complies with § 1005.31(b)(2) and which discloses, among the other disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(2), the changed terms.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>For example, if the provider discloses in the pre-payment disclosure for the first in the series of preauthorized remittance transfers that its fee for each remittance transfer is $20 and, after six preauthorized remittance transfers, the provider increases its fee to $30 (to the extent permitted by contract law), the provider must provide the sender a receipt that complies with §§ 1005.31(b)(2) and 1005.36(b)(2) within a reasonable time prior to the seventh transfer. Barring a further change, this receipt will apply to transfers after the seventh transfer. Or, if, after the sixth transfer, a tax increases from 1.5% of the amount that will be transferred to the designated recipient to 2.0% of the amount that will be transferred to the designated recipient, the provider must provide the sender a receipt that complies with §§ 1005.31(b)(2) and 1005.36(b)(2) within a reasonable time prior to the seventh transfer. In contrast, § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) does not require an updated receipt where an exchange rate, estimated as permitted in § 1005.32, changes.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>New comment 36(a)(2)-2 explains that in order to clearly and conspicuously indicate that the provider's fee has changed as required by § 1005.36(a)(2)(i), the provider could, for example, state on the receipt: “Transfer Fees (UPDATED) * * * $30.” To the extent that other figures on the receipt must be revised because of the new fee, the receipt should similarly indicate that those figures are updated.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In the February Proposal, the Bureau also solicited comment on whether it should provide a safe harbor interpreting the “within a reasonable time” standard for providing a pre-payment disclosure for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. Although such a disclosure is no longer required, the same “within a reasonable time” requirement now applies to receipts required by § 1005.36(a)(2)(i). The bulk of the comments received on how to interpret “within a reasonable time” concerned industry commenters' concerns regarding the requirement in the February Final Rule that any required pre-payment disclosures reflect the actual exchange rates that will apply to preauthorized remittance transfers. Industry commenters stated that it would be difficult to disclose accurate exchange rates ten days before the date of a remittance transfer. Insofar as § 1005.32(b)(2) allows estimates in disclosures provided for remittance transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer, this concern should be alleviated. Industry commenters generally stated that if estimates were permitted, ten days was a reasonable period of time.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>New comment 36(a)(2)-3 explains if a receipt required by § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) (or, as discussed below, required by § 1005.36(d)(1)) is mailed, the receipt would be considered to be received by the sender five business days after it is posted in the mail. If hand delivered or provided electronically, the receipt would be considered to be received by the sender at the time of delivery. Thus, if the provider mails the receipt not later than ten business days before the scheduled date of the transfer, or hand or electronically delivers the receipt not later than five business days before the scheduled date of the transfer, the provider would be deemed to have mailed or delivered the receipt within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of the subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau is modifying § 1005.36(a)(2)(ii) from the February Final Rule, which requires receipts for all subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. As adopted, § 1005.36(a)(2)(ii) explains when receipts must be sent. It states that unless a receipt was provided in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) that contained no estimates pursuant to § 1005.32, the remittance transfer provider must mail or deliver to the sender a receipt described in § 1005.31(b)(2) no later than one business day after the date of the transfer. If the remittance transfer involves the transfer of funds from the sender's account held by the provider, the receipt required by this paragraph may be provided on or with the next periodic statement for that account, or within 30 days after the date of the transfer if a periodic statement is not provided.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau is adopting an additional disclosure requirement for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers as § 1005.36(a)(2)(iii), which requires providers to provide the disclosures required by § 1005.36(d) in accordance with the timing requirements of that section. Section 1005.36(d) is discussed in more detail below.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>36(b) Accuracy</title>
              <analysisParagraph>The February Final Rule contains, in § 1005.36(b), requirements for the accuracy of disclosures for preauthorized remittance transfers. Under that provision in the February Final Rule, the pre-payment disclosures and receipt for the first scheduled transfers in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers are required to be accurate at the time of payment (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> they must comply with § 1005.31(f), which states that disclosures must be accurate when a sender makes payment for the remittance transfer, except to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32). For subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers, as discussed above, the February Final Rule requires providers to give accurate pre-payment disclosures as of when the transfer is made within a reasonable time prior to each transfer and then to provide an accurate receipt after each transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>To further compliance and to enhance consumer protections, the Bureau finds it necessary and proper to use its EFTA section 904(a) and (c) authority to adopt a revised § 1005.36(b). The Bureau is revising § 1005.36(b) to address the accuracy of receipts provided for remittance transfers that are scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer, as well as preauthorized remittance transfers. The Bureau is adopting § 1005.36(b)(1), which states that for a one-time transfer scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer or the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, disclosures provided in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) must comply with § 1005.31(f) by being accurate when the sender makes payment, except to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>For subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers, the Bureau is adopting § 1005.36(b)(2), which states that for each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer, the most recent receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i) must be accurate as of when such transfer is made, except: (i) The temporal elements required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) (Date Available) and (b)(2)(vii) (Transfer Date) must be accurate only if the transfer is the first transfer to occur after the disclosure was provided, and (ii) to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32. As noted above, since a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i) may serve as a disclosure with respect to multiple subsequent preauthorized transfers, the temporal elements disclosed on those receipts need only be accurate with respect to the transfer to occur after the receipt is provided.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>To address situations in which receipts may be provided after the date of a remittance transfer, the Bureau is adopting a new § 1005.36(b)(3). That provision states that such receipts (provided pursuant to either § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) or (a)(2)(ii)) must be accurate as of when the remittance transfer to which it pertains is made, except to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32(a) or (b)(1).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 36(b)-1 addressed estimates and, in particular, stated that providers may use any of the exceptions set forth in § 1005.32, to the extent applicable. This comment is adopted largely as proposed, with changes to reflect the newly adopted § 1005.32(b)(2), which allows for estimates in certain disclosures for transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer, and the revised § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) and (a)(2)(i), which permit use of estimates under § 1005.32(b)(2). The comment also notes that when estimates are permitted, they must be disclosed in accordance with § 1005.31(d).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>New comment 36(b)-2 explains that, for a subsequent transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i), except for the temporal disclosures in that receipt required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) (Date Available) and (b)(2)(vii) (Transfer Date), applies to each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer unless and until it is superseded by a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(2)(i). For each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer, only the most recent receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i) must be accurate as of the date each subsequent transfer is made. As a receipt may apply to multiple transfers in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.</em> disclosure of the date in the foreign country on which funds will be available to the designated recipient) need not be accurate for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers that occur after the first transfer to which the receipt pertains.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Finally, new comment 36(b)-3 clarifies that a receipt required by § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) must accurately reflect the details of the transfer to which it pertains and may not contain estimates pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2). However, the remittance transfer provider may continue to disclose estimates to the extent permitted by § 1005.32(a) or (b)(1). In providing receipts pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) or (a)(2)(ii), § 1005.36(b)(2) and (b)(3) do not allow a remittance transfer provider to change figures previously disclosed on a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i), unless a figure was an estimate or based on an estimate disclosed pursuant to § 1005.32. Thus, for example, if a provider disclosed its fee as $10 in a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) and that receipt contained an estimate of the exchange rate pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2), the second receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) must also disclose the fee as $10. The Bureau is adopting this comment to clarify that the purpose of receipts required by § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) and (a)(2)(ii) is to provide a sender with the actual exchange rate applied to the transfer (unless the statutory exceptions for estimates apply) rather than the estimate previously disclosed for the transfer pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2). Thus, the final rule does not permit a provider to change other items, such as non-estimated fees and taxes, from a prior disclosure applicable to that transfer on the post-transfer receipt.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>36(c) Cancellation</title>
              <analysisParagraph>The February Final Rule contains cancellation requirements for remittance transfers. For most remittance transfers, § 1005.34(a) requires the remittance transfer provider to comply with a cancellation request received no later than 30 minutes after the sender makes payment for the remittance transfer if: (i) The sender's request allows the provider to identify the sender's name and address or telephone number and the specific transaction to be cancelled; and (ii) the transferred funds have not been picked up by the designated recipient or deposited into the recipient's account. For remittance transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, including preauthorized remittance transfers, § 1005.36(c) of the February Final Rule requires the remittance transfer provider to comply with a sender's request for cancellation if the request: (i) Enables the provider to identify the sender's name and address or telephone number and the particular transfer to be cancelled; and (ii) is received at least three business days before the scheduled date of the remittance transfer. Section 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) requires the provider to include a statement about the sender's cancellation rights, using the language set forth in Model Form A-37 of Appendix A to subpart B or substantially similar language.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is amending Regulation E in this final rule to, among other things, clarify the obligations of the remittance transfer provider for remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer and to provide senders with information to calculate the cancellation deadline for remittance transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer. As discussed above, the Bureau is making certain adjustments to the disclosure and timing requirements in other sections of the final rule in order to enhance senders' ability to properly determine the cancellation deadline for remittance transfers, to enable senders to more easily identify and track preauthorized remittance transfers that occur in close proximity to one another, and to facilitate industry compliance with the cancellation disclosure requirements.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the final rule adds § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii), which requires remittance transfer providers to disclose the date of transfer in certain receipts provided to senders pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(2). These requirements apply only to remittance transfers scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, as well as the initial transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers. As discussed below, § 1005.36(d)(2)(ii) also requires future transfer dates to be disclosed for subsequent transfers in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, for which payment is made by the sender four or fewer business days before the date of the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>However, as discussed below, the Bureau is retaining in § 1005.36(c) the requirement that a remittance transfer provider must comply with any oral or written request to cancel a remittance transfer if the request to cancel is received at least three business days before the scheduled date of the remittance transfer. The Bureau is also adopting a new § 1005.36(d) to require providers to disclose the future dates of transfer, cancellation requirements, and provider's contact information for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers no more than 12 months and no less than five business days before the date of the transfer. This timing requirement for these disclosures does not apply to subsequent transfers in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers for which payment is made by the sender four or fewer business days before the date of the transfer. For this subset of transfers, the information required by § 1005.36(d)(1), including future dates of transfer, must instead be included in the receipt for the first transfer in the series of preauthorized remittance transfers provided in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(1)(i). For subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers and transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of transfer, any receipt provided after the transfer is made in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) or (a)(2)(ii) must include the date of transfer (and cancellation requirements) for the transfer that is the subject of the receipt.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisSection>
                <title>The Three-Business-Day Deadline To Cancel</title>
                <analysisParagraph>As noted above, section 919(d)(3) of the EFTA provides the Bureau broad discretion to fashion cancellation requirements for remittance transfers. In the February Final Rule, the Bureau adopted in § 1005.36(c) specific cancellation requirements for remittance transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer. In adopting the three-business-day cancellation rule for such transfers, the Bureau explained that the general 30-minute cancellation period would not be appropriate for remittance transfers scheduled far in advance because it would permit only a short time for cancellation even though the remittance transfer might not occur for many days or even months. 77 FR 6194, 6268. Thus, the Bureau concluded that a three-business-day time period is more beneficial because it provides senders with more time to decide whether to go through with the transaction while giving remittance transfer providers sufficient time to process a cancellation request before the transaction is executed. <em data-original="E-03">Id.</em></analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In the February Proposal, the Bureau explained that further consideration of the three-business-day cancellation rule and its application to remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer was necessary to ensure that the rule provided appropriate protection to senders without imposing an undue burden on providers. 77 FR 6310, 6321. Accordingly, the Bureau solicited comment on whether the three-business-day deadline to cancel advance transfers accomplishes these goals, or whether the deadline to cancel should be more or less than the three days adopted in the February Final Rule. The Bureau also solicited comment on whether it is important to maintain consistency between the cancellation deadline adopted for preauthorized remittances transfers in § 1005.36(c) and the cancellation deadline for preauthorized electronic fund transfers in § 1005.10(c)(1). 77 FR 6310, 6321. Finally, the Bureau solicited comment on whether the deadline to cancel would be easier to calculate if the cancellation period was based on calendar days instead of business days.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Several commenters addressed the cancellation deadline for remittance transfers scheduled three or more business days in advance. Both industry and consumer group commenters generally agreed that the three-business-day time period for cancellation in the February Final Rule appropriately balances the interests of both parties to the transfer. One industry commenter opposed the three-business-day time period for cancellation; this commenter proposed as an alternative a five-day cancellation period, arguing that the Bureau should take into consideration providers' existing compliance obligations under other laws as well. Another industry commenter posited that, if the Bureau does not amend the definition of “remittance transfer provider” to exclude depository institutions executing certain types of international wire transfers, cancellation should be allowed only until a transfer has been executed by a depository institution. One industry commenter agreed that the Bureau should continue to require the deadline to cancel to be expressed in business days as opposed to calendar days.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Although most commenters expressed support for the three-business-day cancellation period, a few industry commenters conditioned their support on whether and to what extent remittance transfer providers may be required to disclose to senders the exchange rates that apply to transfers scheduled before the date of transfer. One industry commenter stated that the three-business-day cancellation period would be appropriate only if a remittance transfer provider were not required to disclose the actual exchange rates that would apply to preauthorized remittance transfers ten days before the dates of such transfers. The industry commenter, however, also agreed that senders should be able to cancel preauthorized remittance transfers or other remittance transfers scheduled to take place in the future, but that the cancellation requirements should be balanced with a shorter time period for exchange rate disclosure. Another industry commenter argued that the three-business-day cancellation requirement would present a substantial risk of loss to a remittance transfer provider if the provider were required to disclose the exchange rate that would apply to a remittance transfer more than one day before the scheduled date of transfer. This commenter suggested that the Bureau establish a bifurcated cancellation structure for transfers scheduled before the date of transfer under which: (i) the 30-minute cancellation period in § 1005.34(a) would apply for any transfer for which the provider discloses the actual exchange rate; and (ii) the three-business-day cancellation period established in § 1005.36(c) would apply for any transfer in which the provider discloses an estimated exchange rate.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau recognizes the concern expressed by a few industry commenters that remittance transfer providers may incur additional risk if the time period to cancel a transfer extends beyond the date upon which a remittance transfer provider must disclose the actual exchange rate that will apply to a remittance transfer. As the Bureau noted in the discussion regarding § 1005.32(b)(2)(i), whenever there are time lags between when the retail exchange rate that applies to a remittance transfer is set, when the relevant foreign currency is purchased, and when funds are delivered, a remittance transfer provider (and/or its business partner) may face losses due to unexpected changes in the value of the relevant foreign currency. The Bureau's decision in § 1005.32(b)(2) of the final rule to allow remittance transfer providers to provide an estimated exchange rate in certain disclosures for remittance transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer should help alleviate these concerns. (<em data-original="E-03">See</em> discussion above regarding § 1005.32(b)(2) for additional analysis of foreign exchange risks.) As a result, under the final rule, a remittance transfer provider will not be required to disclose, prior to the date of the transfer, an actual, as opposed to an estimated, exchange rate if the transfer is scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer. This five-business-day period is shorter than the more than ten day period proposed in the February Proposal and reduces the period during which a remittance transfer provider that permits transfers to be scheduled before the date of transfer may face additional foreign exchange risks due to the gap between the time the provider sets an exchange rate and the date of the transfer. And, while there is a short period outside the cancellation window in which the remittance transfer provider is required to disclose actual rather than estimated exchange rates, the Bureau believes that providers may be able to manage the foreign currency risks or may choose not to offer consumers the ability to schedule remittance transfers in this period. The Bureau does not believe the latter option presents a substantial risk of harm to senders, because it believes that any provider that generally permits consumers to schedule remittance transfers in advance will at least retain the option for consumers to schedule their transfers the day of or five or more business days before the date of the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, the Bureau concludes that the three-day-business cancellation period for remittance transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer as adopted in the February Final Rule is appropriate. The Bureau believes that cancellation rights are important because they allow senders time to review the disclosure for accuracy and cancel the transaction when warranted by a change in circumstances. In addition, the Bureau believes the three-business-day cancellation period strikes an appropriate balance between sender and remittance transfer provider interests. This time period is close enough to the transfer date so that senders will know if there are circumstances warranting a cancellation, while it gives providers an adequate amount of time to process a cancellation request. Finally, as the Bureau noted in the February Final Rule, the three-business-day cancellation period is consistent with the cancellation requirement for electronic fund transfers. 77 FR 6194, 6268. Since many remittance transfer providers also provide electronic fund transfers, maintaining similar regulatory regimes should minimize burden and facilitate compliance.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>Disclosure of Cancellation Period in Pre-Payment Disclosures for Subsequent Preauthorized Remittance Transfers</title>
                <analysisParagraph>In the February Proposal, the Bureau solicited comment on whether a remittance transfer provider should be required to disclose the cancellation period in the pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent remittance transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, rather than in the receipt for each subsequent transfer. As the Bureau recognized in the February Proposal, this issue would be relevant only if the pre-payment disclosure requirement in § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) of the February Final Rule is retained in this rulemaking. 77 FR 6310, 6323.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau is revising the disclosure requirements for preauthorized remittance transfers to eliminate the requirement that remittance transfer providers provide a pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent transfer in series of preauthorized remittance transfers. Instead, the final rule requires that, in most circumstances, a receipt for each subsequent transfer be provided to the sender. Consequently, the Bureau's inquiry of whether the cancellation disclosure should be provided in the pre-payment disclosure or the receipt for each subsequent transfer is now generally moot. Since there generally is no longer a requirement to provide a pre-payment disclosure for subsequent transfers, the sender's cancellation rights must be disclosed on any receipt provided in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(2) and (d)(2) (<em data-original="E-03">see</em> discussion below), as applicable.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>36(d) Additional Requirements for Subsequent Preauthorized Remittance Transfers</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Under the February Final Rule, remittance transfer providers are required to provide senders with both a pre-payment disclosure and a receipt for each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer in a series. Specifically, the pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent transfer must be provided within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of the transfer, and the receipt for each subsequent transfer generally must be provided no later than one business day after the date on which the transfer is made. As discussed above, however, the Bureau is concerned with balancing the interest of consumers in receiving timely disclosures for subsequent transfers with the interests of industry in reducing risks and developing this market segment. Thus, in the February Proposal, the Bureau sought comment on a number of issues related to subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers, including whether senders should receive disclosures for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers and, if so, what form those disclosures should take. 77 FR 6310, 6223. The February Proposal also sought comment on what cancellation rules should apply to these transfers and when those rules should be disclosed to senders.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received few comments in response to its inquiry regarding disclosure of cancellation requirements for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. Among those received, there was little consensus regarding how cancellation rights for subsequent preauthorized transfers should be disclosed. One industry commenter advocated for flexibility on the disclosure requirements to minimize costs. Another industry commenter asserted that the cancellation rights should be included only in the first pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent transfer, while a consumer group commenter posited that a subsequent pre-payment disclosure disclosing cancellation rights should be sent before each subsequent transfer. Only one industry commenter supported including the statement regarding cancellation rights for the next scheduled transfer on the current receipt, arguing that it would give senders more time to cancel the transfer than if the cancellation rights were included in a pre-payment disclosure provided before the subsequent transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Having eliminated the pre-payment disclosure requirement for subsequent transfers and altered the requirements for when a receipt would have to be provided for a subsequent transfer in the final rule, the Bureau is concerned that senders may not receive adequate and timely information regarding the dates of upcoming transfers and, thus, may not know when their right to cancel those transfers expires. Further, as discussed above regarding § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii), even when senders receive disclosures regarding their cancellation rights, they may not have the type of information needed to determine the date on which the right to cancel a subsequent transfer expires. The Bureau is also concerned that, where senders receive a number of receipts in close proximity to one another as part of a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, senders may not have information that would be helpful in distinguishing to which transfer a particular receipt applies.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, to further the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to adopt a new § 1005.36(d), which amends the disclosure requirements for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. Section 1005.36(d)(1)(i) states that, for any subsequent transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the remittance transfer provider must disclose to the sender: (A) the date the provider will make the subsequent transfer, using the term “Future Transfer Date,” or a substantially similar term; (B) a statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation as described in § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv); and (C) the name, telephone number(s), and Web site of the remittance transfer provider. Section 1005.36(d)(1)(ii) states that if the future date or dates of transfer required to be disclosed by this paragraph are described as occurring in regular periodic intervals, <em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> the 15th of every month, rather than as a specific calendar date or dates, the remittance transfer provider must disclose any future date or dates of transfer that do not conform to the described interval.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.36(d)(2)(i) establishes the general timing requirements for disclosures required by § 1005.36(d)(1), stating that, except as described in § 1005.36(d)(2)(ii), the disclosures required by § 1005.36(d)(1) must be received by the sender no more than 12 months, and no less than five business days prior to the date of any subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer to which it pertains. Section 1005.36(d)(2)(i) also states that the disclosures required by § 1005.36(d)(1) may be provided in a separate disclosure or on one or more disclosures required by subpart B related to the same series of preauthorized remittance transfers, so long as the consumer receives the required information for each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer in accordance with the timing requirements of § 1005.36(d)(2)(i).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that information regarding cancellation rights is as important to subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers as it is to other transfers. Accordingly, as noted in the discussion regarding § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii), senders need the date of transfer to determine, among other things, when the cancellation period for a certain preauthorized transfer expires. At the same time, the Bureau recognizes that when authorizing a preauthorized remittance transfer, the sender establishes a recurring schedule. The Bureau believes the repetitive and cyclical nature of preauthorized remittance transfers reduces the need for senders to receive notice of the cancellation period in individual notices sent immediately before each subsequent transfer, and warrants additional flexibility to remittance transfer providers to determine the timing and type of disclosure to be used to advise senders of their cancellation rights for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. The Bureau notes, however, that such notices must be provided within a timeframe that would be useful to senders and is concerned that a notice provided more than 12 months before the date of such transfers would likely be unhelpful to senders. Likewise, a notice received fewer than five business days before the date of transfer may not provide the sender with enough time to determine whether cancellation is warranted and, thus, would also not be helpful to senders.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also recognizes that for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers scheduled four or fewer business days before the date of the transfer, remittance transfer providers will be unable to provide the disclosures regarding the future date of transfer and cancellation rights five or more business days before the date of transfer. Accordingly, § 1005.36(d)(2)(ii) states that for any preauthorized remittance transfer for which the date of transfer is four or fewer business days after the date payment is made for that transfer, the information required by § 1005.36(d)(1) must be provided on or with the receipt described in § 1005.31(b)(2), or disclosed as permitted by § 1005.31(a)(3) and (a)(5), for the initial transfer in that series in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(1)(i). For example, if, on Monday, a sender authorizes a series of preauthorized remittance transfers in which the initial transfer occurs that day and the first subsequent transfer is scheduled to occur on Wednesday, the 30-minute cancellation period under § 1005.34(a) would apply to both transfers. If, however, in the same series of preauthorized remittance transfers the second subsequent remittance transfer is scheduled to occur on Friday, the three-business-day cancellation period would apply to that transfer. For either subsequent transfer, the provider would be unable to provide the required information at least five business days before the date of the transfer. In that instance, the provider would be required to disclose the cancellation period and future date of transfer for the subsequent remittance transfer on or with the receipt provided for the initial preauthorized remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As a result, preauthorized remittance transfers scheduled fewer than three business days from the date of the transfer are now subject to different disclosure requirements than standalone remittance transfers scheduled fewer than three business days from the date of the transfer. With respect to the latter, there is no requirement to disclose the date of transfer or future date of transfer on receipts. The Bureau, however, believes these two sets of transfers present different concerns warranting different treatment. Preauthorized remittance transfers by definition are authorized to recur at substantially regular intervals. As a result, as discussed above, preauthorized remittance transfer present a higher risk of confusion since, depending on the frequency of the subsequent transfers in the series, senders may receive multiple receipts at or around the same time and, absent identifying information such as the date of transfer, may be unable to identify the transfer to which a particular receipt applies. One-time transfers scheduled in advance do not generally present the same risks because in most instances the sender would schedule a single transfer at any given time as opposed to a series of transfers and should not have difficulty identifying the transfer to which the receipt applies. Further, if disclosures were only required for subsequent preauthorized transfers occurring at least three business days in the future, consumers may mistakenly believe that no transfers were scheduled on any days prior to that time.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Thus, while the Bureau believes the date of transfer would be helpful to senders of preauthorized remittance transfers, it does not believe such information is necessary for standalone transfers scheduled fewer than three business days from the date of the transfer. As stated above, the Bureau believes that it will be simpler for remittance transfer providers to program their receipts to include the transfer date information consistently for preauthorized transfers than to create separate receipt forms for one-time and preauthorized remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>New § 1005.36(d)(3) and (d)(4) address formatting and accuracy requirements for disclosures required under § 1005.36(d)(3). Section 1005.36(d)(3) states that the information required by § 1005.36(d)(1)(i)(A) generally must be disclosed in close proximity to the other information required by § 1005.36(d)(1)(i)(B). Section 1005.36(d)(4) states that any disclosure required by § 1005.36(d)(1) must be accurate as of the date the subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer to which it pertains is made.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adopting commentary to provide further guidance on the application of § 1005.36(d). Comment 36(d)-1 clarifies that § 1005.36(d)(2) permits remittance transfer providers some flexibility in determining how and when the disclosures required by § 1005.36(d)(1) may be provided to senders. Comment 36(d)-1 states that the disclosure may be provided as a separate disclosure, or on or with any other disclosures required by subpart B of Regulation E related to the same series of preauthorized remittance transfers, provided that the disclosure and timing requirements in § 1005.36(d)(2) and other applicable provisions in subpart B are satisfied. For example, the required disclosures may be made on or with a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i); a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(2)(ii); or in a separate disclosure created by the provider. The comment also provides a fact pattern describing how a remittance transfer provider would comply with § 1005.36(d)(1).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Comment 36(d)-2 clarifies that § 1005.36(d)(2)(i) requires that the sender receive disclosure of the date of transfer, applicable cancellation requirements, and the provider's contact information no more than 12 months and no less than 5 business days prior to the date of the subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer. Comment 36(d)-2 also cross-references comment 36(a)(2)-3 for purposes of determining when a disclosure required by § 1005.36(d)(1) is received by the sender.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Comment 36(d)-3 provides guidance on how the remittance transfer provider should disclose the date of transfer. Specifically, comment 36(d)-3 clarifies that the date of transfer of a subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer may be disclosed either as a specific date (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> July 19, 2013), or by using a method that clearly permits identification of the date of transfer, such as periodic intervals (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> the third Monday of every month, or the 15th of every month). Comment 36(d)-3 further clarifies that if the future dates of transfer are disclosed as occurring periodically and there is a break in the sequence, or the date of transfer does not conform to the described period, <em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> if a weekend or holiday causes the provider to deviate from the normal schedule, the provider should disclose the specific date of transfer for the affected transfer. Finally, comment 36(d)-4 clarifies the accuracy requirements for disclosures required by § 1005.36(d)(1). Comment 36(d)-4 explains that if any of the information required by § 1005.36(d)(1) changes, the provider must provide an updated disclosure with the revised information that is accurate as of when the transfer is made, pursuant to § 1005.36(d)(2).</analysisParagraph>

                  <title>31(b)(1)(viii) Statements That Non-Covered Third-Party Fees or Taxes Collected on the Remittance Transfer by a Person Other Than the Provider May Apply</title>
                  <analysisParagraph>In the December Proposal, the Bureau solicited comment on methods to reduce the burden of required disclosures of fees and taxes imposed on remittance transfers by persons other than the providers and alternative disclosures that could be provided.  Several industry and consumer group commenters suggested that in place of requiring exact or estimated disclosures of recipient institution fees or foreign taxes, the Bureau could require a statement within the disclosure forms alerting senders that the total amount received may be reduced by recipient institution fees or foreign taxes.  These commenters contended that such a disclosure would ensure that senders are aware of the potential for further reductions in the disclosed amount received, due to fees or taxes that are not disclosed, and would encourage senders and recipients to investigate the fees associated with a transfer to the recipient's financial institution, as compared to those associated with other mechanisms for sending a remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Although the Bureau is eliminating the requirement to calculate and disclose non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider, the Bureau strongly believes that it is nonetheless important to inform senders when fees and taxes that are not disclosed may apply to the remittance transfer.  Accordingly, to further the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes that it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to add § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii), which requires that a provider include, as applicable, a statement indicating that non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider may apply to the remittance transfer and result in the designated recipient receiving less than the amount disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii).  Moreover, under this paragraph, a provider may, but is not required to, disclose any applicable non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider using the language set for in Model Forms A-30(b)-(d) of Appendix A to this part or substantially similar language.  Any such figures must be disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be received, using the language set forth in Model Forms A-30(b) through (d) of Appendix A to this part, as appropriate, or substantially similar language.  The exchange rate used to calculate any disclosed non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider is the exchange rate used in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by § 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate.  Although new § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) makes the disclosure of the amount of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the provider optional, the Bureau believes that providers may be motivated to collect and disclose such information voluntarily, in the interest of providing high levels of customer service to senders and to better compete for remittance business against other providers.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>New comment 31(b)(1)(viii)-1 clarifies that if non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider apply to a particular remittance transfer, or if a provider does not know if such fees or taxes may apply to a particular remittance transfer, § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) requires the provider to include the disclaimer with respect to such fees and taxes.  Comment 31(b)(1)(viii)-1 additionally clarifies that required disclosures under § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) may only be provided to the extent applicable.  For example, if the designated recipient's institution is an agent of the provider and thus, non-covered third-party fees cannot apply to the transfer, the provider must disclose all fees imposed on the remittance transfer and may not provide the disclaimer regarding non-covered third-party fees.  In this scenario, the commentary clarifies, the provider may only provide the disclaimer regarding taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, as applicable.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>New comment 31(b)(1)(viii)-2 explains that § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) permits a provider to disclose the amount of any non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider.  For example, when a remittance transfer provider knows that the designated recipient's institution imposes a fee or that a foreign tax will apply, the provider may choose to disclose the relevant fee or tax as part of the information disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii).  The comment also notes that § 1005.32(b)(3) permits the provider to disclose estimated amounts of such taxes and fees, provided any estimates are based on reasonable source of information. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 32(b)(3)-1.  It further provides that where the provider chooses, at its option, to disclose the amounts of the relevant recipient institution fee or tax as part of the information disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii), the provider must not include that fee or tax in the amounts disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) or (b)(1)(vii).</analysisParagraph>

              <title>31(b) Disclosures</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed section 205.31(b) set forth substantive disclosure requirements for remittance transfers. EFTA sections 919(a)(2)(A) and (B) require a remittance transfer provider to provide to a sender: (i) A written pre-payment disclosure with information applicable to the sender's remittance transfer—specifically, the exchange rate, the amount of transfer and other fees, and the amount that would be received by the designated recipient; and (ii) a written receipt that includes the information provided on the pre-payment disclosure, plus the promised date of delivery, contact information for the designated recipient, information regarding the sender's error resolution rights, and contact information for the remittance transfer provider and applicable regulatory agencies. EFTA section 919(a)(5)(C) also authorizes the Bureau to permit a remittance transfer provider to provide a single written disclosure to a sender, instead of a pre-payment disclosure and receipt, that accurately discloses all of the information required on both the pre-payment disclosure and the receipt. Section 1005.31(b)(1) and (2) finalize these substantive disclosure requirements for pre-payment disclosures and receipts, respectively. The final rule also permits the use of a combined disclosure, in lieu of the pre-payment disclosure and receipt, subject to the requirements in § 1005.31(b)(3).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed below, consumer group commenters opposed the combined disclosures, but otherwise generally supported the disclosures as proposed. These commenters stated that senders currently lack the information about exchange rate, fees, and timing that is required in the disclosures. Many industry commenters generally opposed the proposed disclosures. One industry commenter stated that the Board's consumer testing demonstrated that senders were satisfied with remittance transfer providers' existing disclosures, and that the new requirements would impose significant costs without commensurate benefits to senders.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters further argued that compliance with the disclosure requirements was not possible for wire transfers and international ACH transactions. Specifically, industry commenters opposed the requirements to disclose the exchange rate, fees and taxes imposed by a person other than the provider, and the date of funds availability. One money transmitter commenter stated that these disclosure requirements could also be problematic for some money transmitters, where an international wire transfer is part of the transaction, such as when a sender conducts an account-to-account remittance transfer through a money transmitter.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed below, the Bureau understands the unique compliance challenges for institutions that send remittance transfers via wire transfer or ACH. However, as previously noted, the statute specifically applies the disclosure requirements in EFTA sections 919(a)(2)(A) and (B) to both open network and closed network transactions and provides a specific accommodation to address the compliance challenges faced for open network transactions. As such, the final rule requires all remittance transfer providers to provide either the pre-payment disclosure and a receipt, or a combined disclosure, except to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to EFTA section 919(a)(2), information on a pre-payment disclosure and a receipt need only be provided to the extent applicable to the transaction. Similarly, the information required on a combined disclosure need only be provided as applicable because the combined disclosure is simply a consolidation of the pre-payment disclosure and the receipt. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A) and (B). Proposed comment 31(b)-1 clarified that a remittance transfer provider could choose to omit an inapplicable item provided in proposed § 205.31(b). Alternatively, a remittance transfer provider could disclose a term and state that an amount or item is “not applicable,” “N/A,” or “None.” The proposed comment provided examples of when certain disclosures may not be applicable. For example, if fees or taxes are not imposed in connection with a particular transaction, the provider need not provide the disclosures about fees and taxes generally required by proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(ii) and (vi). Similarly, a Web site need not be disclosed if the provider does not maintain a Web site. The proposed comment also included an example of instances in which exchange rate information was not required on the disclosures for transactions that are both funded and received in U.S. dollars.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>One industry trade association commenter argued that dollar-to-dollar transactions should be completely excluded from the disclosure requirements. The Bureau believes, however, that fee and tax information should be disclosed to senders, even if there is no exchange rate applied to the transfer. The final rule does not exclude dollar-to-dollar transactions from the disclosure requirements, but clarifies that the exchange rate disclosure is not required for such transactions.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed, with clarifying revisions providing that an exchange rate is not required to be disclosed if an exchange rate is not applied to the transfer, even if it is not a dollar-to-dollar transaction. As such, the final comment states that a provider need not provide the exchange rate disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) if a recipient receives funds in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, or if funds are delivered into an account denominated in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded. For example, if a sender in the United States transfers funds from an account denominated in Euros to an account in France denominated in Euros, no exchange rate would need to be provided. Similarly, if a sender funds a remittance transfer in U.S. dollars and requests that a remittance transfer be delivered to the recipient in U.S. dollars, a provider need not disclose an exchange rate.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(b)-2 addressed the requirements in proposed § 205.31(b) that certain disclosures be described either using the terms set forth in § 205.31(b) or substantially similar terms. As discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the Board developed and selected the terms used in proposed § 205.31(b) through consumer testing to ensure that senders could understand the information disclosed to them. However, the May 2011 Proposed Rule provided remittance transfer providers with flexibility in developing their disclosures, both for disclosures in English and in each of the foreign languages principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers, either orally or in writing, at that office. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(g) below.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comment regarding proposed comment 31(b)-2, and it is finalized substantially as proposed. In the final rule, comment 31(b)-2 states that terms may be more specific than the terms used in the final rule. For example, a remittance transfer provider sending funds to Colombia may describe a tax disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) as a “Colombian Tax” in lieu of describing it as “Other Taxes.” Foreign language disclosures required under § 1005.31(g) must contain accurate translations of the terms, language, and notices required by § 1005.31(b).</analysisParagraph>

                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(i) provided that the remittance transfer provider must disclose the amount that will be transferred to the designated recipient using the term “Transfer Amount” or a substantially similar term. Under the proposal, the transfer amount would have to be disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be transferred because the Board believed the disclosure of the transfer amount would help demonstrate to a sender how a provider calculates the total amount of the transaction, discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters agreed that the disclosure of the transfer amount as a separate line item would help senders understand the total amount to be paid in order to send the requested amount of currency to a recipient. Industry commenters asked the Bureau to clarify how to make a disclosure in the currency in which funds will be transferred. These commenters asked if this requirement only applied where a remittance transfer provider performed the conversion. These commenters suggested that the final rule should clarify that the disclosures should be provided in the denomination of the account used to fund the transfer or in the currency submitted by the sender for the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that the transfer amount should be disclosed as proposed in order to help demonstrate the cost of the transfer to a sender. Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau deems is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to finalize this requirement in § 1005.31(b)(1)(i). For clarity, the final rule provides that the transfer amount must be disclosed in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, rather than the currency in which funds will be transferred. The Bureau believes that disclosing the transfer amount in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded—whether the sender pays with cash, with currency in an account, or by other means—will, when combined with the other required disclosures, help senders calculate the effect of the exchange rate on the transaction, if there is a currency exchange. For example, if the funds will be exchanged from U.S. dollars to Mexican pesos, the transfer amount required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(i) must be disclosed in U.S. dollars. Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(1)(i) provides that the remittance transfer provider must disclose the amount that will be transferred to the designated recipient, in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, using the term “Transfer Amount” or a substantially similar term.</analysisParagraph>

The proposal stated that the disclosure must be described using the term “Transfer Fees,” “Transfer Taxes,” or “Transfer Fees and Taxes,” or a substantially similar term. These disclosures were proposed pursuant to EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(ii), which requires a remittance transfer provider to disclose the amount of transfer fees and any other fees charged by the remittance transfer provider for the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.i. clarified that taxes imposed by the remittance transfer provider include taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a State or other governmental body. The proposed comment also provided guidance applicable to the disclosure of both fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider, as well as fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, which are discussed in detail below. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), below. The proposed comment addressed the requirement that a remittance transfer provider only disclose fees or taxes as applicable. The proposed comment also stated that if both fees and taxes are imposed, the fees and taxes may be disclosed as one disclosure or as separate, itemized disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters and an industry commenter argued that the Bureau should require itemized fees and tax disclosures. They believed itemized disclosures would help senders understand what costs are fixed, such as taxes, and what costs may vary depending on the provider, such as fees. However, another industry commenter stated that disclosing fees and taxes together provided senders with adequate information on the total cost of the transaction.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees that separately listing the fees and taxes on disclosures provides better information to the sender about fixed and variable costs of the transaction, and the final rule provides that fees and taxes must be disclosed separately. Section 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) also clarifies that the fees and taxes must be disclosed in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(b)(1)(i), above. Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) states that a remittance transfer provider must disclose any fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider, in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, using the terms “Transfer Fees” for fees and “Transfer Taxes” for taxes or substantially similar terms. Comment 31(b)(1)-1.i. in the final rule is changed from the proposal to state that if both fees and taxes are imposed, the fees and taxes must be disclosed as separate, itemized disclosures. For example, a provider would disclose all transfer fees using the term “Transfer Fees” or a substantially similar term and would separately disclose all transfer taxes as “Transfer Taxes” or a substantially similar term.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter argued that because a tax is imposed by the government, and not by the remittance transfer provider, EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(ii) does not require taxes to be disclosed and, as such, the rule should not require disclosure of taxes. The Bureau believes the statute intended to require the disclosure of all charges imposed on the remittance transfer that would affect the cost of a remittance transfer to the sender. To the extent taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a State or other governmental body are charged to the sender by the remittance transfer provider, the Bureau believes they are required to be disclosed under EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(ii), which requires a remittance transfer provider to disclose transfer fees and any other fees charged by the remittance transfer provider for the remittance transfer. Even if EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(ii) did not require that such taxes be disclosed to senders, the Bureau believes that disclosing the taxes imposed on the remittance transfer will demonstrate to the sender the calculation of the total amount that the sender pays for the transfer and how this amount relates to amount that will be received by the designated recipient and is therefore necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA. As such, to the extent necessary, the Bureau is also requiring these taxes to be disclosed pursuant to its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c). Therefore, as proposed, comment 31(b)(1)-1.i. in the final rule clarifies that taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the remittance transfer provider include taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a State or other governmental body.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Finally, as proposed, comment 31(b)(1)-1.i. addresses the disclosure of fees and taxes that are applicable to the transfer. The comment in the final rule states that a provider need only disclose fees or taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider in § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) and imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), as applicable. For example, if no transfer taxes are imposed on a remittance transfer, a provider would only disclose applicable transfer fees.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii. distinguished between the fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider and the fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider. This proposed comment is addressed in the discussion regarding fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), below.</analysisParagraph>

                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(iii) required the disclosure of the total amount of the transaction. Although this total is not required by the statute, the Board proposed to require the disclosure of the total amount of the transaction to further the purposes of the EFTA by enabling a sender to understand the total amount to be paid out-of-pocket for the transaction. The Bureau did not receive comment on the proposed provision. Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to adopt § 205.31(b)(1)(iii) as proposed in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iii).The final rule requires a remittance transfer provider to disclose the total amount of the transaction, which is the sum of § 1005.31(b)(1)(i) and (ii), in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, using the term “Total” or a substantially similar term.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>31(b)(1)(iv) Exchange Rate</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(iv) required the disclosure of any exchange rate used by the provider for the remittance transfer, rounded to the nearest 1/100th of a decimal point, consistent with EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(iii). The proposed rule stated that the exchange rate must be described using the term “Exchange Rate” or a substantially similar term. The proposed rule did not permit floating rates, where the exchange rate is set when the designated recipient claims the funds.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters strongly supported the prohibition of unknown or floating exchange rates. Many industry commenters, however, urged that the final rule should accommodate floating rates and other circumstances in which an exchange rate may not be known at the time the sender requests the remittance transfer. A few industry commenters argued that the statute does not require the disclosure of an exchange rate set by institutions other than the remittance transfer provider. The commenters stated that by requiring the disclosure of the exchange rate to be used by the remittance transfer provider for the remittance transfer, EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(iii) only requires disclosure of an exchange rate that the remittance transfers provider itself set for the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>For example, industry commenters stated that most credit unions offering international transfers do not perform currency conversions themselves, but instead rely on correspondent banks or other business partners to do so. Some industry commenters also stated that most credit unions offering international transfers work with currency providers in real time to contract for exchange rates. The commenters argued that this allows the credit unions to provide their members with the most competitive exchange rates. However, in such an arrangement the exchange rate that will be applied is only known at the time the contract is accepted, and would not be known at the time disclosures are provided to the senders. Similarly, other industry commenters stated that with their current processes and systems, they would know an exchange rate once a remittance transfer is processed, but not when the remittance transfer is requested.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters also stated the exchange rate cannot be determined at the time of the request when a sender designates the receipt of a transaction in one currency, but the receiving account is denominated in another currency. In those cases, the receiving institution must convert the funds into another currency in order to complete the transfer. One industry commenter stated that its customers sometimes request remittance transfers to be sent to their foreign accounts in U.S. dollars. These senders, however, have arrangements with the recipient institutions holding their foreign accounts to convert the funds to the currencies of the accounts either at the spot rates available at the time the accounts are credited or at rates pre-arranged by contracts between the senders and the recipient institutions. One industry commenter stated that, in some countries, a recipient may choose to be paid in one of multiple currencies. The commenter also stated that it permits consumers to change the designated country for pick up. In these cases, the currency in which funds will be received may change at the option of the recipient.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>A Federal Reserve Bank commenter, as well as industry commenters, argued that requiring a fixed exchange rate for purposes of providing an exchange rate disclosure would result in less favorable exchange rates for senders. These commenters stated that if providers are required to fix the exchange rate, they will increase the spread they use in order to minimize the risks associated with rate volatility, so the cost of sending remittance transfers would increase for senders. One money transmitter commenter argued that requiring a disclosure of a fixed rate could also lead remittance transfer providers to stop providing services to some locations in which they have historically used floating rates. This commenter noted that such a requirement would require it to renegotiate its contracts with approximately 100 foreign agents representing about 10,000 locations that currently offer only floating rates. This commenter stated that this change would affect about a half million customers annually.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter believed that a remittance transfer provider should instead be permitted to disclose that the exchange rate will be changed at the rate set by a daily central bank or other official rate plus or minus a fixed offset, such as a commission. Other industry commenters suggested permitting disclosure of an estimated exchange rate, as long as the provider also discloses that the rate is subject to change. A Federal Reserve Bank commenter believed that floating exchange rate products should be exempted from the disclosure provisions in the rule.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau interprets the statute to require a remittance transfer provider to disclose to the sender the exchange rate to be used for the remittance transfer to the sender, both at the time the sender requests the remittance transfer and when the sender pays for the transfer. This interpretation is based on several factors. First, the fact that the exchange rate may be set by another institution involved in the remittance transfer does not change the fact that it will be used by the remittance transfer provider in effectuating the sender's request. Second, the statute specifically requires disclosure of the amount to be received by the designated recipient, using the values of the currency into which the funds will be exchanged. This disclosure requires a provider to determine the exchange rate to be used to effectuate the transfer, whether that rate is set by the remittance transfer provider or a third party.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The purpose of the statute supports the same conclusion. As discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the disclosure was intended to provide senders with certainty regarding the exchange rate and the amount of currency their designated recipients would receive. Senders would not be able to tell, for example, whether the funds they transmit are sufficient to pay household expenses and other bills where remittance products are based on floating rates.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau understands, however, that there may be instances in which a sender will request funds to be delivered in a particular currency, but the funds are later converted into another currency due to facts that cannot be known to the provider. In these circumstances, the Bureau believes the remittance transfer provider complies with the requirement to disclose the exchange rate when it discloses information based on the request of the sender, even if the funds are ultimately received in a different currency. If the sender does not know the currency in which the funds will be received or requests funds to be received in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, the Bureau believes that the provider may assume that the currency in which funds will be received is the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded. <em data-original="E-03">See also</em> comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-1, below.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(b)(iv) of the final rule requires disclosure of the exchange rate used by the provider for the remittance transfer, as proposed. Comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-1 clarifies that if the designated recipient will receive funds in a currency other than the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, a remittance transfer provider must disclose the exchange rate to be used by the provider for the remittance transfer. An exchange rate that is estimated must be disclosed pursuant to the requirements of § 1005.32, discussed below. A remittance transfer provider may not disclose, for example, that an exchange rate is “unknown,” “floating,” or “to be determined.”</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-1 further clarifies that if a provider does not have specific knowledge regarding the currency in which the funds will be received, the provider may rely on a sender's representation as to the currency in which funds will be received for purposes of determining whether an exchange rate is applied to the transfer. For example, if a sender requests that a remittance transfer be deposited into an account in U.S. dollars, the provider need not disclose an exchange rate, even if the account is actually denominated in Mexican pesos and the funds are converted prior to deposit into the account. If a sender does not know the currency in which funds will be received, the provider may assume that the currency in which funds will be received is the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded. The Bureau notes that if a provider does not independently have specific knowledge of the currency in which funds will be received, the provider may rely on the sender's representation as to the currency in which funds will be received. For example, the rule does not impose on providers a duty to inquire about this information with a third party.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters also argued that the exchange rate should be permitted to include more than two decimal places, consistent with their current disclosure practices. One industry commenter stated that providing exchange rates that include more than two decimal places provides senders with more accurate and detailed exchange rate information.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees that it may be appropriate for some providers to disclose an exchange rate that includes more than two decimal places, because a provider may determine that the disclosure would provide a sender with a more accurate representation of the remittance transfer's cost, based on the particular type of transaction or type of currency being used. However, the Bureau also believes that some providers may determine that rounding to fewer digits may sufficiently inform senders of the cost of the exchange. The Bureau is also mindful that a disclosure that includes a long string of numbers could confuse some senders. The Bureau believes it is appropriate to permit a remittance transfer provider to disclose an exchange rate rounded to a number of decimal places that best reflects the cost to the sender, within a range that will not potentially confuse the sender.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) authority in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) to permit the exchange rate to be rounded consistently for each currency to no fewer than two decimal places and no more than four decimal places. The exchange rate must be disclosed using the term “Exchange Rate” or a substantially similar term. Comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-2 of the final rule is revised to reflect the more flexible rounding requirements. Comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-2 clarifies that the exchange rate disclosed by the provider for the remittance transfer is required to be rounded. The provider may round to two, three, or four decimal places, at its option. For example, if one U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9483779 Mexican pesos, a provider may disclose that the U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9484 Mexican pesos. The provider may alternatively disclose, for example, that the U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.948 pesos or 11.95 pesos. On the other hand, if one U.S. dollar exchanges for exactly 11.9 Mexican pesos, the provider may disclose that “US$1=11.9 MXN” in lieu of, for example, “US$1=11.90 MXN.”</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Though the Bureau is permitting flexibility for rounding exchange rate disclosures, the Bureau believes that each provider should disclose its exchange rates in a consistent manner. The Bureau believes that if a provider were permitted to round exchange rates for a particular currency on a transaction-by-transaction basis, a provider could round exchange rates differently in order to make the exchange rate appear to be more favorable. For example, the Bureau does not believe a provider that typically rounds to four decimal places for a specific currency (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> the U.S. dollar exchanges for 0.7551 Euros) should be permitted to round to two decimal places for some of those currency transactions (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> the U.S. dollar exchanges for 0.76 Euros). Comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-2 thus clarifies that the exchange rate disclosed for the remittance transfer must be rounded consistently for each currency. For example, a provider may not round to two decimal places for some transactions exchanged into Euros and round to four decimal places for other transactions exchanged into Euros.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, a provider may use an exchange rate that is not necessarily set by the provider itself. The final rule adds a new comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-3 to clarify that the exchange rate used by the provider and applied to the remittance transfer need not be set by that provider. For example, an exchange rate set by an intermediary institution and applied to the remittance transfer would be the exchange rate used for the remittance transfer and must be disclosed by the provider.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters and an industry trade association asked the Bureau to clarify how the exchange rate requirements would apply when a remittance transfer involves a prepaid card. These commenters asked how disclosures, such as the exchange rate, could be provided in accordance with the timing provisions in the May 2011 Proposed Rule when a provider would not know when the recipient would withdraw funds abroad or how much the recipient would withdraw. To the extent a prepaid card is covered by the rule, <em data-original="E-03">see</em> § 1005.30(e), the funds that will be received by the designated recipient are those that are loaded on to the prepaid card by the sender at the time of the transaction. Often a prepaid card is both funded and loaded in U.S. dollars, and funds remain on the card in U.S. dollars until a cardholder withdraws funds in a foreign country. In these instances, a provider need not provide the exchange rate disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), because a recipient will receive the currency in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 31(b)-1.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Finally, a Federal Reserve Bank commenter noted that the exchange rate cannot be determined when a sender initiates payment on a recurring basis. The Bureau recognizes the unique challenges relating to recurring payments, and the final rule provides alternative provisions for these circumstances in § 1005.36, discussed below.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>31(b)(1)(v) Transfer Amount</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(v) generally required providers to repeat the disclosure of the transfer amount in proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(i). Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(v), however, required the transfer amount to be disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be received by the designated recipient to demonstrate to the sender how third party fees or taxes imposed under proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(vi), which are also required to be disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be received, would reduce the amount received by the designated recipient. Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(v), however, only required this repeat disclosure if third party fees or taxes are imposed under proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(vi), because it would not otherwise be necessary to demonstrate a reduction of the transfer amount by third party fees and taxes. The proposed disclosure was required to be described using the term “Transfer Amount” or a substantially similar term. Both the transfer amount required to be disclosed by proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(i) and the transfer amount required to be disclosed by proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(v) were proposed to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comment on the requirement to disclose the transfer amount in proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(v). Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to finalize this requirement as proposed in § 1005.31(b)(1)(v). The Bureau received comments regarding concerns about making disclosures in the currency in which the funds will be received by the designated recipient. These comments, and a clarification regarding the currency in which the funds will be received by the designated recipient, are discussed below. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-1.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(b)(1)-2 provided more guidance on the requirement to repeat the transfer amount disclosure in some circumstances, and it is adopted substantially as proposed. The comment reflects the clarification in the final rule that disclosure under § 1005.31(b)(1)(i) must be disclosed in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded. Comment 31(b)(1)-2 clarifies that two transfer amounts are required to be disclosed by § 1005.31(b)(1)(i) and (v). First, a provider must disclose the transfer amount in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded to show the calculation of the total amount of the transaction. Typically, the remittance transfer is funded in U.S. dollars, so the transfer amount would be expressed in U.S. dollars. However, if remittance transfer is funded, for example, from a Euro-denominated account, the transfer amount would be expressed in Euros.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Second, a provider must disclose the transfer amount in the currency in which the funds will be made available to the designated recipient. For example, if the funds will be picked up by the designated recipient in Japanese yen, the transfer amount would be expressed in Japanese yen. However, the comment also clarifies that this second transfer amount need not be disclosed if fees and taxes are not imposed for the remittance transfer under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). As discussed above, in such cases, there is no consumer benefit to the additional information if the transferred amount is not reduced by other fees and taxes.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(b)(1)(v) also requires a remittance transfer provider to use the term “Transfer Amount” or a substantially similar term to describe the disclosure required under this paragraph. Comment 31(b)(1)-2 clarifies, as proposed, that the terms used to describe each transfer amount should be the same.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau believes that the rounded exchange rate required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) is intended only to ensure that senders are not overwhelmed by a disclosure of an exchange rate with many numbers following the decimal point. The Bureau does not believe it is intended to constrain the number of decimal places involved in calculating other disclosures. Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(1)(v) adds the clarification that the exchange rate used to calculate the transfer amount in § 1005.31(b)(1)(v) is the exchange rate in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by § 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate. Comment 31(b)(1)-3 provides examples to demonstrate the exchange rate that must be used to calculate not only the transfer amount in § 1005.31(b)(1)(v), but also the fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) and the amount received in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii). For example, if one U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9483779 Mexican pesos, a provider must calculate these disclosures using this rate, even though the provider may disclose pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) that the U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9484 Mexican pesos. Similarly, if a provider estimates pursuant to § 1005.32 that one U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9483 Mexican pesos, a provider must calculate these disclosures using this rate, even though the provider may disclose pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) that the U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.95 Mexican pesos (Estimated). If an exchange rate need not be rounded, a provider must use that exchange rate to calculate these disclosures. For example, if one U.S. dollar exchanges for exactly 11.9 Mexican pesos, a provider must calculate these disclosures using this exchange rate.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>31(b)(1)(vi) Fees and Taxes Imposed by a Person Other Than the Provider</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(vi) stated that a remittance transfer provider must disclose any fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, in the currency in which the funds will be received by the designated recipient. Such fees and taxes could include lifting fees charged in connection with an international wire transfer, a fee charged by a recipient institution or agent, or a tax imposed by a government in the designated recipient's country. Because such fees and taxes affect the amount ultimately received by the designated recipient, the Board proposed the disclosure of other fees and taxes to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters supported the disclosure of third party fees and taxes to senders of remittance transfers, stating that such a disclosure would be consistent with the language and purpose of the statute, and would best inform the sender of the amount the recipient would ultimately receive. In contrast, industry commenters opposed the disclosure. Most industry commenters argued that compliance with the proposed disclosure requirement would be burdensome, if not impossible. Commenters stated that financial institutions sending wire transfers and international ACH transactions only have control over the delivery to the next institution, and in some cases do not have a relationship with all of the subsequent intermediary institutions involved in a transfer or with the recipient institution. The originating institution may, in some cases, know the routing, but in other cases have no legal or technological means to control routing of a transaction once the transfer has been initiated and, therefore, it cannot know what institutions might be imposing fees or taxes on the remittance transfer. One industry commenter suggested that providing the disclosures may be possible for repeat wire transfers, because fee and tax information is known from the previous transfers, but not for new wire transfers.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters and a Federal Reserve Bank commenter argued that third party fees and taxes may not be known at the time of the transaction, which could result in the remittance transfer provider providing misleading information to the sender. Industry commenters also argued that smaller institutions do not have the resources to obtain or monitor information about foreign tax laws or fees charged by unrelated financial institutions that may be involved in the transfer. Some commenters noted that intermediary financial institutions, both inside and outside of the United States, are not required to disclose their fees. Moreover, some industry commenters argued, the sharing of fee information among financial institutions could violate privacy and competition laws. Industry commenters stated that no comprehensive information is available regarding foreign tax laws. Because an institution may not have resources to track tax laws in every foreign country to which it sends a remittance transfer, the commenters argued that some providers would limit the locations to which they send remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Further, some industry commenters noted that a recipient may enter into an agreement with a recipient institution that permits the institution to impose fees for an international payment received by the institution and applied to the recipient's account. The commenters stated that remittance transfer providers would not know whether the recipient has agreed to pay such fees or how much the recipient may have agreed to pay. The commenters argued that such fees charged to a recipient by a third party pursuant to an agreement between the recipient and a third party should not be required to be disclosed.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters argued that the statute did not intend for third party fees and taxes to be included in the disclosure of the total amount that will be received by the designated recipient. For example, one industry commenter argued that the statute only intended to include in the calculation of the amount of currency to be received the elements specifically required to be disclosed under EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii) (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the amount of transfer fees and any other fees charged by the remittance transfer provider, and any exchange rate to be used by the remittance transfer provider for the remittance transfer). Another industry commenter argued that State laws that require a remittance transfer provider to disclose to a sender the total amount to be received by the designated recipient do not require disclosure of third party fees and taxes that may be imposed on the remittance transfer. Instead, the commenters argued, State laws only require the remittance transfer provider to disclose the amount of currency to be received after application of the exchange rate. Therefore, the commenters stated that fees or taxes set by a party other than the remittance transfer provider are not required to be included in the disclosure of the total amount received and, therefore, should not be required to be disclosed separately.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Overall, many industry commenters stated that the proposed disclosure requirements would cause financial institutions to withdraw from the market or restrict the locations to which wire transfers will be sent. The commenters also stated that the proposed requirements would increase costs to senders, and some argued that the proposed requirements would delay transactions while financial institutions determined the required information in order to make disclosures. Some industry commenters argued that the requirements put financial institutions at a competitive disadvantage compared to money transmitters, which, they argued, are typically able to know the required disclosures due to their closed network structure. Further, they argued that the proposed requirements could deter foreign financial institutions from agreeing to process U.S.-originated remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Generally, industry commenters urged the Bureau to exempt financial institutions that provide remittance transfers through correspondent relationships from the requirement to disclose third party fees or require different disclosures for these types of transactions. Industry commenters and a Federal Reserve Bank commenter also suggested that the final rule should incorporate a good faith standard with respect to these fee and tax disclosures. Some industry commenters further argued that the Bureau should not require foreign taxes to be provided, regardless of whether a remittance transfer was sent through a correspondent relationship. Industry commenters alternatively suggested that the Bureau only require a disclosure that the amount received may be subject to foreign taxes. A Federal Reserve Bank commenter suggested that the Bureau should provide a safe harbor for the foreign tax disclosure for providers that disclosed current or historical information available to the provider through reasonable efforts.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Commenters also suggested that the Bureau assist industry with determining unknown fees and taxes, particularly to help ease the disclosure burden on small providers. One industry commenter believed the Bureau should require correspondent institutions to publish the fees and taxes that are charged. Industry and consumer group commenters suggested that the Bureau should maintain a resource that provides relevant foreign taxes.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the introduction above, the Bureau recognizes the challenges for remittance transfer providers to determining fees and taxes imposed by third parties. However, the plain language of the statute requires disclosure of the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient. The Bureau believes this requires remittance transfer providers to determine the costs specifically related to the remittance transfer that may reduce the amount received by the designated recipient. Congress specifically recognized that these determinations would be difficult with regard to open network transactions by financial institutions and tailored a specific accommodation to allow use of reasonably accurate estimates for an interim period until financial institutions can develop methods to determine exact disclosures, such as fees and taxes charged by third parties.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>This disclosure provides consumer benefits by making senders aware of the impact of these fees and taxes, which is essential to fulfill the purpose of the statute. Providing a total to recipient that reflects the impact of third party fees and taxes, and separately disclosing those fees and taxes, will provide senders with a greater transparency regarding the cost of a remittance transfer. For many senders and recipients, disclosure of the amount of third party fees and taxes that may be deducted could be crucial to knowing whether the amount transferred will be sufficient to pay important household expenses and other bills. Senders also need to know the amount of such fees and taxes to determine whether to use the same provider for any future transfers. Without such information, it would be difficult for a sender to determine the costs of the transfer that would enable the sender to choose the most cost-effective method of sending remittance transfers. Moreover, as discussed below, the cost of third party taxes may vary depending on the types of institutions involved in the transmittal route, and disclosure of these taxes will assist senders comparing costs between providers. While the Bureau understands that tax information may not be readily available to a provider, the provider is in the best position to obtain the information to comply with the disclosure requirements. Because a provider will be engaged in sending remittance transfers to certain countries and, in some cases, will have relationships with entities in those countries, the Bureau believes the provider itself is in the best position to determine foreign tax information.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to require in § 1005.31(b)(vi) of the final rule the disclosure of any fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, using the terms “Other Fees” for fees and “Other Taxes” for taxes, or substantially similar terms.<footnote ref="76">Due to a scrivener's error, § 205.31(b)(vi) in the proposed rule had stated that these fees and taxes must be disclosed using the term “Other &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Transfer&lt;/em&gt; Fees,” “Other &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Transfer&lt;/em&gt; Taxes,” or “Other &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Transfer&lt;/em&gt; Fees and Taxes,” or a substantially similar term (emphasis added). The model forms as proposed, however, used the term “Other Fees and Taxes.” The terms set forth in § 1005.31(b)(vi) are adopted without the word “transfer” in order to more concisely describe the fees and taxes required to be disclosed in § 1005.31(b)(vi). The terms used in the final rule conform to the language used in the model forms, which participants in consumer testing generally understood to mean fees and taxes charged by a person other than the provider.</footnote>
                  As discussed above, fees and taxes must be disclosed separately from one another in order to show which costs are fixed and which costs are variable. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 31(b)(1)-1.i. As discussed above, the Bureau believes that the rounded exchange rate required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) is not intended to constrain the number of decimal places involved in calculating other disclosures. Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) adds the clarification that the exchange rate used to calculate the fees and taxes in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) is the exchange rate in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by § 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate. As discussed above, comment 31(b)(1)-3 provides examples to demonstrate the exchange rate that must be used to calculate the fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As noted above, proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii. distinguished between the fees and taxes imposed by the provider, discussed above in § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii), and the fees and taxes imposed by a person other than the provider. The proposed comment provided examples of each of these types of fees and taxes. Proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii. also clarified that the terms used to describe each of these types of fees and taxes must differentiate between such fees and taxes and provided an example to illustrate this differentiation.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters requested clarification regarding the types of fees imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider. For example, an industry commenter and a Federal Reserve Bank commenter asked the Bureau to clarify that these fees and taxes do not include fees and taxes that banks and other parties charge one another for handling a remittance transfer, so long as the fees do not affect the amount of the transfer. Another industry commenter asked whether funds deducted from the amount received in a remittance transfer by a recipient institution exercising its rights of set-off would be required to be disclosed as a fee to a sender.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii. of the final rule clarifies that the fees and taxes required to be disclosed include only those that are charged to the sender or designated recipient and are specifically related to the remittance transfer. The Bureau does not believe that any fee or tax is required to be disclosed solely because it is charged at the same time that a remittance transfer is sent, because such fees and taxes are not necessarily “imposed on the remittance transfer.” For example, an overdraft fee charged by a bank at the same time that a remittance transfer is sent or received in an account is not imposed on the remittance transfer. In order to further clarify what charges should be disclosed to senders, the comment in the final rule provides examples of the types of fees that are not required to be disclosed under this provision, in addition to the examples of the types of fees that should be included that were included in the May 2011 Proposed Rule.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Specifically, comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii. states that the fees and taxes required to be disclosed by § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) include all fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider. For example, a provider must disclose a service fee and any State taxes imposed on the remittance transfer. In contrast, the fees and taxes required to be disclosed by § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) include fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider. Fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider include only those fees and taxes that are charged to the sender or designated recipient and are specifically related to the remittance transfer. For example, a provider must disclose fees imposed on a remittance transfer by the receiving institution or agent at pick-up for receiving the transfer, fees imposed on a remittance transfer by intermediary institutions in connection with an international wire transfer, and taxes imposed on a remittance transfer by a foreign government.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>However, the comment states that a provider need not disclose, for example, overdraft fees that are imposed by a recipient's bank or funds that are garnished from the proceeds of a remittance transfer to satisfy an unrelated debt, because these charges are not specifically related to the remittance transfer. Similarly, fees that banks charge one another for handling a remittance transfer or other fees that do not affect the total amount of the transaction or the amount that will be received by the designated recipient are not charged to the sender or designated recipient. For example, an interchange fee that is charged to a provider when a sender uses a credit or debit card to pay for a remittance transfer need not be disclosed. The comment also clarifies that the terms used to describe the fees or taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider in § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) and imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) must differentiate between such fees and taxes. For example, the terms used to describe fees disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) and (vi) may not both be described solely as “Fees.”</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-1 clarified how a provider must disclose fees and taxes in the currency in which funds will be received. Industry commenters expressed concern that a remittance transfer provider may not know the currency in which the funds will be received. As discussed above in comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-1, if a provider does not have specific knowledge regarding the currency in which the funds will be received, the provider may rely on a sender's representations as to the currency in which funds will be received.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed, with an added clarification regarding reliance on a sender's representation regarding the currency in which the funds will be received. The Bureau is also revising the comment to reflect the clarification that disclosures that require an exchange rate to be applied should use the exchange rate in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by § 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-1 states that § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) requires the disclosure of fees and taxes in the currency in which the funds will be received by the designated recipient. A fee or tax described in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) may be imposed in one currency, but the funds may be received by the designated recipient in another currency. In such cases, the remittance transfer provider must calculate the fee or tax to be disclosed using the exchange rate in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by § 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate. For example, an intermediary institution in an international wire transfer may impose a fee in U.S. dollars, but funds are ultimately deposited in the recipient's account in Euros. In this case, the provider would disclose the fee to the sender expressed in Euros, calculated using the exchange rate used by the provider for the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The comment further states that for purposes of § 1005.31(b)(1)(v), (vi), and (vii), if a provider does not have specific knowledge regarding the currency in which the funds will be received, the provider may rely on a sender's representation as to the currency in which funds will be received. For example, if a sender requests that a remittance transfer be deposited into an account in U.S. dollars, the provider may provide the disclosures required in § 1005.31(b)(1)(v), (vi), and (vii) in U.S. dollars, even if the account is denominated in Mexican pesos and the funds are subsequently converted prior to deposit into the account. If a sender does not know the currency in which funds will be received, the provider may assume that the currency in which funds will be received is the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The final rule also adds a new comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-2 to address situations where the information needed to determine the foreign taxes that apply to a transaction is not known to the provider and not publically available. Some industry commenters stated that foreign taxes may depend on variables other than the country to which the remittance transfer is sent, such as by the specific tax status of the sender and receiver, account type, or type of financial institution. The commenters stated that a sender may not be aware of the information needed to determine the tax obligation that applies to the transaction.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that when these types of variables affect the foreign taxes that apply to the transaction, providers may have to rely on representations made by the sender. If the sender does not know the information, and the provider does not otherwise have specific knowledge of the information, the Bureau believes it is necessary to provide a reasonable mechanism by which the provider may disclose the foreign tax. The Bureau believes it is appropriate in these instances to disclose the highest tax that could be imposed with respect to a particular variable, so the sender is not surprised that the amount received is reduced by more taxes than what is disclosed.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-2 states that the amount of taxes imposed by a person other than the provider may depend on the tax status of the sender or recipient, the type of accounts or financial institutions involved in the transfer, or other variables. For example, the amount of tax may depend on whether the receiver is a resident of the country in which the funds are received or the type of account to which the funds are delivered. If a provider does not have specific knowledge regarding variables that affect the amount of taxes imposed by a person other than the provider for purposes of determining these taxes, the provider may rely on a sender's representations regarding these variables, pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). If a sender does not know the information relating to the variables that affect the amount of taxes imposed by a person other than the provider, the provider may disclose the highest possible tax that could be imposed for the remittance transfer with respect to any unknown variable.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that if a provider does not independently have specific knowledge regarding variables that affect the amount of taxes imposed by a person other than the provider, the provider may rely on the sender's representations regarding these variables. For example, the rule does not impose on providers a duty to inquire about this information with a third party. The Bureau also notes that a provider may continue to rely on the sender's representations in any subsequent remittance transfers, unless the provider has specific knowledge that information relating to such variables has changed.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>31(b)(1)(vii) Amount Received</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(vii) stated that a remittance transfer provider must disclose to the sender the amount that will be received by the designated recipient, in the currency in which the funds will be received. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(i). The proposed rule stated that the disclosures should be described using the term “Total to Recipient” or a substantially similar term. The proposed rule provided that the disclosure must reflect all charges that would affect the amount to be received.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>For the reasons discussed above, industry commenters objected to the proposal because, they argued, costs that are required to be known to disclose the amount received, such as the exchange rate and third party fees and taxes, cannot be known at the time the pre-payment disclosure and receipt are required to be disclosed. As discussed above, an industry commenter argued that the statute only intended the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient to reflect the other elements that are required to be disclosed separately under EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii). Other industry commenters argued that the disclosure should only reflect the exchange rate, fees, and taxes set by the remittance transfer provider itself, and not those set or charged by persons other than the provider. Some industry commenters believed the amount that will be received by the designated recipient should be subject to a good faith standard, should be permitted to be estimated, or should include a statement that the total amount is subject to change.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(i) requires a remittance transfer provider to disclose the amount received by the designated recipient using the values of the currency into which the funds will be exchanged. The Bureau interprets the amount to be received by the designated recipient as the amount net of all fees and taxes that will be paid for the transfer. An exchange rate, if one is applied, is just one of the factors that could affect the actual amount received by the designated recipient. Providing a total amount to be received that does not take into account all cost elements would not be consistent with the statute's goal of providing disclosures of the total costs of a remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is not persuaded that the amount to be received by the designated recipient should only reflect those elements that are separately required to be disclosed under the statute. Under the plain language of EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(i), the amount of funds that will be received by the designated recipient must be disclosed to the sender. The Bureau believes this amount must reflect all fees and taxes specifically related to the remittance transfer, regardless of the entity that charges them. Moreover, the Bureau believes that the exchange rate to be used to calculate the total to recipient is the exchange rate that is used for the remittance transfer, whether or not the remittance transfer provider itself sets the exchange rate or merely applies an exchange rate set by another entity to the transaction. Absent this approach, providers could disclose different amounts received depending only on whether the provider itself or a different institution applies the exchange rate. The Bureau believes such a result would be inconsistent with the statutory goal of providing the sender with the actual amount that will be received by the designated recipient.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Therefore, proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(vii) is adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii), with an addition to clarify the appropriate exchange rate that must be used to calculate the amount received, discussed below. Comment 31(b)(1)(vii)-1 is also adopted substantially as proposed to clarify the charges that must be reflected in the amount received. The comment is amended to clarify that the disclosed amount received must be reduced by the amount of any fee or tax, whether the fee or tax is imposed on the remittance transfer by the remittance transfer provider or by a person other than the remittance transfer provider. The comment clarifies that the fees and taxes that must be disclosed are those fees and taxes that are imposed on the remittance transfer. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 31(b)(1)-1-ii. Specifically, comment 31(b)(1)(vii)-1 states that the disclosed amount to be received by the designated recipient must reflect all charges imposed on the remittance transfer that affect the amount received, including the exchange rate and all fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the remittance transfer provider, the receiving institution, or any other party in the transmittal route of a remittance transfer. The disclosed amount received must be reduced by the amount of any fee or tax that is imposed on the remittance transfer by any person, even if that amount is imposed or itemized separately from the transaction amount.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Finally, § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) revises proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(vii) to clarify the exchange rate that should be used in calculating the amount received. One industry commenter stated that using a rounded exchange rate may add some <em data-original="E-03">de minimis</em> value to the amount received. For some currencies, this may result in a transaction amount being disclosed in a foreign currency for which no coins are available to complete the transaction. The commenter recommended a <em data-original="E-03">de minimis</em> exemption for error resolution triggered based on rounding. As discussed above, the Bureau believes that the rounded exchange rate required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) is not intended to constrain the number of decimal places involved in calculating other disclosures. Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) adds the clarification that the exchange rate used to calculate the amount received in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) is the exchange rate in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by § 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate. As discussed above, comment 31(b)(1)-3 provides examples to demonstrate the exchange rate that must be used to calculate the amount received.</analysisParagraph>

As discussed above, the Bureau is requiring providers to disclose some information in the pre-payment disclosure, such as the transfer amount, that is not specifically required by EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A). The Bureau did not receive comment regarding the requirement to provide the same pre-payment disclosures on the receipt. Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to finalize that requirement in renumbered § 1005.31(b)(2)(i), as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisSection>
                <title>31(b)(2)(ii) Date Available</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(2) also provided for the disclosure of additional elements on the receipt. EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(i)(II) requires the disclosure of the promised date of delivery to the designated recipient on a receipt. The Board stated its belief that the statute requires disclosure of the date the currency will be available to the designated recipient, not the date the funds are physically picked up by the designated recipient, because the recipient may not pick up the funds for some period of time after the funds are available. Thus, proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(ii) stated that a remittance transfer provider must disclose the date of availability of funds to the designated recipient, using the term “Date Available” or a substantially similar term. Proposed comment 31(b)(2)-1 provided further guidance on this disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In the proposal, the Board recognized that in some instances, it may be difficult to determine the exact date on which a remittance transfer will be available to a designated recipient. For example, an international wire transfer may pass through several intermediary institutions prior to becoming available at the institution of a designated recipient, and the time it takes to pass through these intermediaries may be difficult to determine. As a result, the Board recognized that remittance transfer providers would likely disclose the latest date on which the funds would be available, even if funds are often available sooner. Thus, proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(ii) permitted a provider to include a statement that funds may be available to the designated recipient earlier than the date disclosed, using the term “may be available sooner” or a substantially similar term. The Board had tested various terms in consumer testing for communicating the fact that funds may be available earlier than the date disclosed. Participants generally understood the meaning of the statement that funds “may be available sooner” better than other terms.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters supported the disclosure of the date funds will be available. Many industry commenters argued, however, that it would be difficult or impossible to determine when funds would be made available to a recipient in an open network system, such as where transfers are made to an account at a financial institution with which the provider does not have a correspondent relationship. Industry commenters argued that even if the date of receipt by a recipient financial institution is known, there could be a delay in depositing the funds into a recipient account due to delays at intermediary financial institutions or at the recipient institution. One industry trade association stated that infrastructure deficiencies in some countries may make it impossible to determine the actual date on which funds will be available.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>An industry commenter supported the flexibility provided by the term “may be available sooner,” but stated that dates still may be unpredictable for reasons beyond a provider's control. One industry trade association argued that in order to mitigate compliance risks, some remittance transfer providers will disclose a date well past a reasonable estimate of the date funds will be made available, which would render the disclosure meaningless.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Due to these factors, some industry commenters urged the Bureau to permit an estimated date of availability, including an estimate of the date that funds may be available to a recipient institution, and not the recipient. One commenter suggested that the disclosure could state that a transfer may be delayed by intermediaries or other factors beyond the provider's control.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As stated in the proposal, EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(i)(II) requires disclosure of a single, promised date of delivery of the funds. Neither EFTA section 919(a)(4) nor EFTA section 919(c) permit a remittance transfer provider to provide an estimate of this promised date, despite the fact that the statute permits estimates in other circumstances. Moreover, because the statute requires a remittance transfer provider to provide a disclosure of the promised date of delivery to the designated recipient, the Bureau believes that permitting a provider to disclose the date that funds will be made available to the recipient institution would not comply with the statute.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that by permitting the provider to disclose a date by which funds will certainly be delivered, but also stating that funds “may be available sooner,” a provider can comply with the disclosure requirement. The Bureau recognizes that providers may overestimate the disclosed date on which funds will be available to mitigate compliance risks. However, the Bureau believes that competitive pressures will give providers an incentive to provide as accurate a date as possible.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) is finalized substantially as proposed. Section 1005.31(b)(2)(ii), however, clarifies in the rule, rather than the commentary, as proposed, that a provider must disclose the date in the foreign country on which funds will be available to the designated recipient. This clarification is included to account for instances where time zone differences result in a date in the United States being different from the date in the country of the designated recipient.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The final rule also adopts comment 31(b)(2)-1 substantially as proposed. The comment clarifies that a remittance transfer provider may not provide a range of dates that the remittance transfer may be available, nor an estimate of the date on which funds will be available. If a provider does not know the exact date on which funds will be available, the provider may disclose the latest date on which the funds will be available. For example, if funds may be available on January 3, but are not certain to be available until January 10, then a provider complies with § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) if it discloses January 10 as the date funds will be available. However, a remittance transfer provider may also disclose that funds “may be available sooner” or use a substantially similar term to inform senders that funds may be available to the designated recipient on a date earlier that the date disclosed. For example, the provider may disclose “January 10 (may be available sooner).”</analysisParagraph>

                <title>31(b)(2)(iv) Rights of Sender</title>
                <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail below regarding §§ 1005.33 and 1005.34, EFTA section 919(d) provides the sender with substantive error resolution and cancellation rights. EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(ii)(I) requires a remittance transfer provider to provide a statement containing information about the rights of the sender regarding the resolution of errors on the receipt or combined disclosure. EFTA section 919(d)(3) requires the Bureau to issue final rules regarding appropriate cancellation and refund policies for senders. The Board stated its belief that providing a lengthy disclosure to the sender each time the sender makes a remittance transfer could be ineffective at conveying the most important information that a sender would need to resolve an error or cancel a transaction. However, the Board also stated that a sender should have access to a complete description of the sender's error resolution and cancellation rights in order to effectively exercise those rights. As a result, the Board proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(iv) in conjunction with a long form error resolution notice in proposed § 205.31(b)(4). The two disclosures were intended to balance the interest in providing a sender a concise disclosure with the sender's ability to obtain a full explanation of those rights.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(iv) stated that a remittance transfer provider must disclose to a sender an abbreviated statement about the sender's error resolution and cancellation rights using language set forth in Model Form A-37 of Appendix A or substantially similar language. The proposed statement included a brief disclosure of the sender's error resolution and cancellation rights, as well as a notification that a sender may contact the remittance transfer provider for a written explanation of these rights.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters argued that the abbreviated disclosure in proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(iv) should provide more comprehensive information to a sender. These commenters also suggested that the abbreviated disclosure would not comply with the statute. One of the consumer group commenters stated that all of the senders' rights should be disclosed on the receipt, instead of a shorter disclosure, because senders of remittance transfers may be less educated or less likely to have access to phone and internet compared to other consumers.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees that education of senders about the consumer protections created by EFTA section 919 is an important statutory and policy goal. However, the Bureau believes EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(ii)(I) does not require a remittance transfer provider to enumerate a sender's error resolution rights. Rather, the statute requires the provider to disclose information about the rights of the sender under EFTA section 919 regarding the resolution of errors, and the Bureau believes the proposed language satisfies this requirement. Moreover, consumer testing participants understood and responded positively to the concise, abbreviated disclosure and favorably compared the statement against current error resolution disclosures with which they had experience and which they noted could be long and in “fine print.” Thus, the Bureau is finalizing the abbreviated disclosure requirement in renumbered § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv). <em data-original="E-03">See also</em> § 1005.31(b)(4), below. The Bureau, however, is amending the language in the abbreviated statement about senders' error resolution rights on Model Form A-37 to include a more explicit statement informing senders that they have such rights. The Bureau is also adding a requirement in § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) to account for the alternative cancellation requirements in § 1005.36(c) for remittance transfers scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, as discussed below. Section 1005.31(b)(2)(iv), therefore, also provides that for any remittance transfer scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, the statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation must instead reflect the requirements of § 1005.36(c).</analysisParagraph>

                <title>31(b)(2)(v) Contact Information of the Provider</title>
                <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(ii)(II) generally requires that the remittance transfer provider disclose appropriate contact information for the remittance transfer provider, its State regulator, and the Bureau. The Board stated that appropriate contact information includes the name, telephone number, and Web site of these entities, so that senders would have multiple options for addressing any issues that may arise with respect to a remittance transfer provider. Proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(v) provided for the disclosure of the name, telephone number, and Web site of the remittance transfer provider. The Bureau did not receive comment on proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(v), and the Bureau is finalizing it substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(b)(2)(v). The final rule adds language to allow providers to disclose more than one telephone number to account for circumstances, for example, where a provider maintains a separate TTY/TDD telephone number.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>31(b)(2)(vi) Agency Contact Information</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(vi) provided for disclosure of a statement that the sender can contact the State agency that regulates the remittance transfer provider and the Bureau for questions or complaints about the remittance transfer provider, using language set forth in Model Form A-37 of Appendix A or substantially similar language. The proposed statement included contact information for these agencies, including the toll-free telephone number of the Bureau established under section 1013 of the Dodd-Frank Act.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Board requested comment on several aspects of proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(vi). First, the Board solicited comment on whether and how a remittance transfer provider should be required to disclose information regarding a State agency that regulates the provider for remittance transfers conducted through a toll-free telephone number or online and, if so, what would be the appropriate State agency to disclose to a sender. Some commenters believed the disclosure of Bureau contact information would be sufficient. Several industry commenters argued that the Bureau should not require a remittance transfer provider to disclose the State agency that regulates the remittance transfer. These commenters believed the requirement would create operational hurdles for providers that operate in multiple states and would provide negligible consumer protection benefit.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>One money transmitter commenter stated that it would be difficult to tailor State regulator disclosures to each individual agent, and that managing State-specific receipts and forms would be costly. This commenter stated that agents that provide services in multiple states often distribute forms to their locations as part of their chain of distribution. Requiring these agents to manage State-specific forms, the commenter argued, would be a significant change in distribution processes and could create liability risk for the remittance transfer provider. This commenter believed remittance transfer providers would thus create a multi-State disclosure form, which would provide senders with superfluous information.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Another money transmitter commenter noted that many states already have guidance regarding the prominence and placement of contact information on a remittance transfer provider's Web site and in storefront locations. The commenter stated that many states prefer senders to contact the remittance transfer provider before contacting a State agency for questions and complaints. The commenter believed that the Bureau should instead require a statement that would refer to other sources, such as a Web site or toll-free number, to obtain contact information for the appropriate State agency, and that the Bureau should maintain contact information for State agencies, so that senders could contact the Bureau for appropriate State agency information.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(ii)(II) requires a remittance transfer provider to provide appropriate contact information for the State agency that regulates the remittance transfer provider. The Bureau does not believe that providing contact information for an alternative source that maintains a list of State agencies would satisfy the statutory requirement. The Bureau recognizes that remittance transfer providers that have locations in multiple states, or that provide remittance transfers online or by telephone, will have to determine the appropriate State agency to disclose on a receipt. The Bureau believes that due to segregation and other formatting requirements, discussed below, a remittance transfer provider may not disclose contact information for agencies in other states. Therefore, the final rule maintains the requirement to disclose information regarding a State agency that regulates the remittance transfer provider.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>However, several changes are made in the final rule to clarify which State agency should be disclosed, because a remittance transfer provider may be regulated by more than one agency in a particular State. The Bureau believes that the statute is meant to provide senders a resource for addressing problems regarding a particular remittance transfer and that the State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider is the appropriate State agency to provide such assistance to senders. Thus, in § 1005.31(b)(2)(vi), the final rule adds the clarification that the disclosure must disclose the State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider with respect to the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Second, the Board requested comment on whether a remittance transfer provider should be required to disclose the contact information for the Bureau, including the toll-free telephone number, in cases where the Bureau is not the primary Federal regulator for consumer complaints against the remittance transfer provider. The Board also requested comment on whether it would be appropriate to instead require the contact information of the primary Federal regulator of the remittance transfer provider for consumer complaints.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters and an industry commenter stated that the Bureau's contact information should be included on the receipt. These commenters stated that listing the Bureau's contact information, rather than the primary Federal regulator, would ensure that consumer complaints about remittance transfer provider were centralized in one Federal agency. The commenter suggested that even if the Bureau does not directly regulate a remittance transfer provider, the Bureau could track complaints and launch an investigation if a pattern and practice of non-compliance emerges.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees that it is appropriate to provide the Bureau's contact information, even in instances where the Bureau is not the provider's primary Federal regulator, as required by EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(ii)(II)(bb). The Bureau believes that providing a single Federal agency as the appropriate contact for senders will assist in tracking complaints. The Bureau is not requiring a separate disclosure of a primary Federal regulator in the final rule, because the disclosure of multiple Federal agencies could confuse senders. Instead, the Bureau believes consumers are better served by contacting the Bureau, which can direct senders to the appropriate Federal agency as necessary. Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(2)(vi) in the final rule requires a remittance transfer provider to disclose the contact information for the Bureau, including the toll-free telephone number.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Board requested comment on whether financial institutions that are primarily regulated by Federal banking agencies, such as national banks, should be required to disclose State regulatory agency information. The Board requested comment regarding the circumstances in which it might be appropriate to disclose such a State regulatory agency.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters stated that the rule should only require Federally-chartered depository institutions to provide contact information for their primary Federal regulator. One industry commenter argued that providing information regarding State regulators would be confusing and ineffective, since its primary Federal regulator already has an established procedure for addressing errors.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes the final rule sufficiently accounts for circumstances in which an institution may not be licensed or chartered by a State agency. Under the final rule, the provider must disclose the State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider. However, disclosures must only be disclosed as applicable. Consequently, if no State agency licenses or charters a particular provider, then no State agency is required to be disclosed.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adding several other changes to § 1005.31(b)(2)(vi) in the final rule for clarity. The final rule adds language to allow providers to disclose more than one telephone number for the State agency that licenses or charters the provider and the Bureau to account for circumstances, for example, where these agencies maintain separate TTY/TDD telephone numbers. The provision also adds the requirement that a remittance transfer provider must disclose the name of both the State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider and the Bureau, in addition to the telephone number(s) and Web site of each agency.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(b)(2)(vi) of the final rule states that a remittance transfer must provide a statement that the sender can contact the State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider with respect to the remittance transfer and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for questions or complaints about the remittance transfer provider. The statement must use the language set forth in Model Form A-37 of Appendix A to this part or substantially similar language. The disclosure also must provide the name, telephone number(s), and Web site of the State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider with respect to the remittance transfer and the name, toll-free telephone number(s), and Web site of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(2)-2 has been added to the final rule to clarify that a remittance transfer provider must only disclose information about a State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider with respect to the remittance transfer, as applicable. For example, if a financial institution is solely regulated by a Federal agency, and not licensed or chartered by a State agency, then the institution need not disclose information about a State agency and would solely disclose information about the Bureau, whether or not the Bureau is the provider's primary Federal regulator.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The final rule also adds comment 31(b)(2)-3 to clarify that a remittance transfer provider must only disclose information about one State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider with respect to the remittance transfer, even if other State agencies also regulate the remittance transfer provider. For example, a provider may disclose information about the State agency which granted its license. If a provider is licensed in multiple states, and the State agency that licenses the provider with respect to the remittance transfer is determined by a sender's location, a provider may make the determination as to the State in which the sender is located based on information that is provided by the sender and on any records associated with the sender. For example, if the State agency that licenses the provider with respect to an online remittance transfer is determined by a sender's location, a provider could rely on the sender's statement regarding the State in which the sender is located and disclose the State agency that licenses the provider in that State. A State-chartered bank must disclose information about the State agency that granted its charter, regardless of the location of the sender.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisSection>
                <title>31(b)(3) Combined Disclosure</title>
                <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(5)(C) grants the Bureau authority to permit a remittance transfer provider to provide to a sender a single written disclosure instead of the pre-payment disclosure and receipt, if the information disclosed is accurate at the time at which payment is made. The combined disclosure must include the content provided in the pre-payment disclosure and the receipt under EFTA sections 919(a)(2)(A) and (B). As discussed above, the Bureau is also requiring providers to disclose some information in the pre-payment disclosure and receipt, such as the transfer amount, that is not specifically required by EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A) or (B). The Board determined through consumer testing that participants understood the information provided on the combined disclosure, and about half of the participants stated that they would prefer to receive the single, combined disclosure rather than a pre-payment disclosure and a separate receipt. Therefore, proposed § 205.31(b)(3) generally permitted a remittance transfer provider to provide the disclosures described in proposed § 205.31(b)(1) and (2) in a single disclosure prior to payment, as applicable, as an alternative to providing the two disclosures described in proposed § 205.31(b)(1) and (2).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters urged the Bureau not to permit combined disclosures. One consumer group commenter stated that requiring both a pre-payment disclosure and a receipt would permit consumers to audit the transaction and ensure that providers do not impose hidden fees. This commenter noted that the combined disclosure would not likely reduce compliance burdens for providers because State laws may already mandate a post-transaction receipt. Another consumer group commenter argued that two disclosures were necessary to perform two different legal functions. This commenter stated that a pre-transaction disclosure serves as an offer that provides terms of written contract, and a receipt indicates that the contract has been agreed upon. This commenter believed a combined disclosure would be too confusing to senders and that the proposed rule did not address how the combined disclosure will ensure information is accurate. Some industry commenters argued that the Bureau should permit the combined disclosure, but maintained that it should be permitted to be provided after payment is made. <em data-original="E-03">See also</em> § 1005.31(e), discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Some consumer testing participants stated that they would prefer to receive a pre-payment disclosure and a receipt because they were concerned that the combined disclosure would not provide proof of payment for the remittance transfer. Therefore, in the proposal, the Board solicited comment on whether proof of payment should also be required for remittance transfer providers using the combined disclosure and, if so, solicited comment on appropriate methods of demonstrating proof of payment for the combined disclosure. Consumer group commenters contended that methods for providing proof of payment could not be adequately set forth in the final rule. An industry commenter argued against requiring proof of payment for the combined disclosure, based on the challenges posed by the required timing of combined disclosures. Another industry commenter maintained that senders were satisfied with the existing proof of payment provided to them.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes a combined disclosure has benefits. Based on the Board's consumer testing, the Bureau believes that senders will understand the combined disclosures provided to them and that some senders will prefer to receive disclosures in a combined format. As discussed with respect to § 1005.31(f), below, the provider must ensure that the combined disclosure is accurate when payment is made. Moreover, the Bureau believes that the combined disclosure could reduce the compliance burden for some providers because the provider would only be required to provide one disclosure, rather than two, with mandated content in a specified format. Therefore, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to permit this alternative disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>However, the Bureau also believes that senders need to be able to confirm that they have completed the transaction. A proof of payment enables senders to demonstrate that the combined disclosure they received was part of a completed transaction. A proof of payment would also help remittance transfer providers determine which transfers have actually been completed, so that a sender cannot assert error resolution rights based on a combined disclosure, where a sender has not made payment for the transfer. Thus, the Bureau is adding a proof of payment requirement to the final rule.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to finalize the combined disclosure requirement. Section 1005.31(b)(3) states that as an alternative to providing the disclosures described in § 1005.31(b)(1) and (2), a remittance transfer provider may provide the disclosures described in § 1005.31(b)(2), as applicable, in a single disclosure pursuant to the timing requirements of § 1005.31(e)(1). If the remittance transfer provider provides the combined disclosure and the sender completes the transfer, the remittance transfer provider must provide the sender with proof of payment when payment is made for the remittance transfer. The proof of payment must be clear and conspicuous, provided in writing or electronically, and provided in a retainable form. The final rule also adds new comment 31(b)(3)-1, which clarifies that the combined disclosure must be provided to the sender when the sender requests the remittance transfer, but prior to payment for the transfer, pursuant to § 1005.31(e)(1), and the proof of payment must be provided when payment is made for the remittance transfer. The comment also clarifies that the proof of payment for the transaction may be provided on the same piece of paper as the combined disclosure or on a separate piece of paper. For example, a provider may feed a combined disclosure through a computer printer when payment is made to add the date and time of the transaction, a confirmation code, and an indication that the transfer was paid in full. A provider may also provide this additional information to a sender on a separate piece of paper when payment is made.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that the use of the term “proof of payment” does not suggest or establish an evidentiary standard. The requirement to provide a sender with proof of payment is only intended to convey to a sender that payment has been received. To this end, new comment 31(b)(3)-1 also clarifies that a remittance transfer provider does not comply with the requirements of § 1005.31(b)(3) by providing a combined disclosure with no further indication that payment has been received.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>31(b)(4) Long Form Error Resolution and Cancellation Notice</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(4) stated that a remittance transfer provider must provide a notice to the sender describing the sender's error resolution and cancellation rights under proposed §§ 205.33 and 205.34 upon the sender's request. As discussed above, consumer group commenters argued that comprehensive error resolution and cancellation rights should be stated on the receipt or combined disclosure in lieu of an abbreviated disclosure, and not only upon request by a sender. The Bureau is retaining the abbreviated disclosure in the final rule. However, the Bureau also believes that a sender must have access to a complete description of the sender's error resolution and cancellation rights.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The requirement to provide a long form error resolution and cancellation notice is adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(b)(4). The final rule adds the requirement that the notice must be provided promptly to the sender. The Bureau believes that adding a timing requirement to the provision will ensure that providers do not delay in providing the notice to a sender, and the requirement to provide notices promptly is consistent with other provisions in Regulation E. <em data-original="E-03">See, e.g.,</em> § 1005.11(d)(1). Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(4) states that, upon the sender's request, a remittance transfer provider must promptly provide to the sender a notice describing the sender's error resolution and cancellation rights, using language set forth in Model Form A-36 of Appendix A to this part or substantially similar language. As discussed above with respect to § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv), the Bureau is adding a requirement in § 1005.31(b)(4) to account for the alternative cancellation requirements in § 1005.36(c) for remittance transfers scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, as discussed below. Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(4) also provides that for any remittance transfer scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, a description of the rights of the sender regarding cancellation must instead reflect the requirements of § 1005.36(c).</analysisParagraph>

              <title>31(c) Specific Format Requirements</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(c) set forth specific format requirements for the written and electronic disclosures required by this section. Proposed § 205.31(c)(1) and (2) contained grouping and proximity requirements for certain disclosures required under proposed § 205.31. Proposed § 205.31(c)(3) set forth prominence and size requirements for disclosures required by subpart B. Proposed § 205.31(c)(4) contained segregation requirements for disclosures provided under subpart B, with certain specified exceptions.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In the proposal, the Board recognized that the specific formatting requirements set forth in proposed § 205.31(c) were more prescriptive than other disclosures required under Regulation E. The Board requested comment on whether certain requirements in proposed § 205.31(c) could be less prescriptive, while still ensuring that senders are provided with clear and conspicuous disclosures. The Board also solicited comment on how the formatting requirements in proposed § 205.31 could be applied to transactions conducted via mobile application or text message.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received comments regarding each of the proposed format requirements, which are discussed in turn below. Additionally, one industry commenter suggested that the formatting requirements in the final rule should accommodate State law disclosures. The Bureau believes it is appropriate to establish formatting requirements tailored to the elements required to be disclosed under the statute. Providers can separately comply with each State's formatting requirements, to the extent that they meet or exceed the requirements set forth in the final rule. The Bureau believes that the proposed formatting requirements will ensure that disclosures are clear and conspicuous as required under EFTA section 919(a)(3)(A) and will thereby help senders understand the costs of remittance transactions. As discussed in the proposal, the formatting requirements demonstrate to senders the mathematical relationship between one line item and another, in part by presenting the required information in a logical sequence. Therefore, the Bureau is generally adopting the formatting requirements as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Commenters also raised concerns regarding the proposed formatting requirements as applied to disclosures provided via mobile application or text message. Industry commenters argued that prescriptive formatting requirements conducive to paper disclosures may not easily apply to new methods of conducting remittance transfers, and that the proposed rule could make compliance difficult as new technologies arise. These commenters urged the Bureau to provide flexibility for formatting requirements for disclosures provided via mobile application or text message. These commenters noted that formatting may be constrained by data and character limits, and that a remittance transfer provider does not necessarily control formatting when disclosures are sent through these methods.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters also noted that senders using mobile applications or text messages could incur additional costs due to the formatting requirements. For example, additional data charges may apply for disclosures provided via mobile application or text message to accommodate formatting requirements. These charges could make senders reluctant to make transfers via mobile application or text message and, therefore, create a disincentive for providers to make remittance transfers available through these alternative methods. They argued that the provider should have the flexibility to provide disclosures using various methods—such as text message, mobile application, email, internet, or mail—as long as the sender is capable of receiving the disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed above in the supplementary information to § 1005.31(a)(5), remittance transfer providers can provide oral pre-payment disclosures for transactions conducted by mobile application or text message. The Bureau does not believe senders would be less protected by receiving disclosures via mobile application or text message than if they received oral disclosures, even if the mobile applications and text messages are not subject to standard formatting requirements.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Therefore, the Bureau is generally not requiring in the final rule that pre-payment disclosures provided via mobile application or text message comply with the grouping, proximity, font size, and segregation requirements of the final rule. Though these disclosures are not subject to these formatting requirements in the final rule, the Bureau expects that providers will provide mobile application or text message disclosures in a logical sequence to demonstrate to senders the mathematical relationship between one line item and another in order to disclose the information clearly and conspicuously. Moreover, pre-payment disclosures provided via mobile application or text message must be provided in equal prominence to each other, as required in § 1005.31(c)(3), discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisSection>
                <title>31(c)(1) Grouping</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(c)(1) provided that the information about the transfer amount, fees and taxes imposed by the provider, and total amount of transaction must be grouped together. The purpose of this grouping requirement was to make clear to the sender that the total amount charged is comprised of the transfer amount plus any transfer fees and taxes. Proposed § 205.31(c)(1) also provided that the information about the transfer amount in the currency to be made available to the designated recipient, fees and taxes imposed by a person other than the provider, and amount received by the designated recipient must be grouped together. The purpose of this grouping requirement was to make clear to the sender how the total amount to be transferred to the designated recipient, in the currency to be made available to the designated recipient, would be reduced by fees or taxes charged by a person other than the remittance transfer provider.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comments on the proposed grouping requirements beyond the general comments about the proposed formatting requirements, discussed above. Thus, the Bureau is adopting the proposed requirement substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(c)(1), with revisions to address the applicability of the grouping requirements to mobile applications and text messages. Section 1005.31(c)(1) states that the information required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) generally must be grouped together. The information required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(v), (vi), and (vii) generally must be grouped together. Disclosures provided via mobile application or text message, to the extent permitted by § 1005.31(a)(5), need not be grouped together.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(c)(1)-1 is also adopted substantially as proposed. The comment clarifies that information is grouped together for purposes of subpart B if multiple disclosures are in close proximity to one another and a sender can reasonably calculate the total amount of the transaction, and the amount that will be received by the designated recipient. Proposed Model Forms A-30 through A-35 in Appendix A, discussed in more detail below, illustrate how information may be grouped to comply with the rule. The proposed comment also clarifies that a remittance transfer provider may group the information in another manner. For example, a provider could provide the grouped information as a horizontal, rather than a vertical, calculation.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>31(c)(2) Proximity</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(c)(2) provided that the exchange rate must be disclosed in close proximity to the other disclosures on the pre-payment disclosure. The Board stated in the May 2011 Proposed Rule that disclosing the exchange rate in close proximity to both the calculations that demonstrate the total transaction amount, as well as the total amount the recipient would receive, would help a sender understand the effect of the exchange rate on the transaction. Proposed § 205.31(c)(2) also provided that error resolution and cancellation disclosures must be disclosed in close proximity to the other disclosures on the receipt. The Board determined in consumer testing that providing a brief statement regarding error resolution and cancellation rights located near the other disclosures effectively communicated these rights to a sender. Therefore, the Board provided that the error resolution and cancellation disclosures should be closely proximate to the other disclosures on the receipt to prevent such disclosures from being overlooked by a sender.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comment on the proposed proximity requirements beyond the general comments addressing the proposed formatting requirements discussed above. Thus, the Bureau is adopting the proposed requirement substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(c)(2), with revisions to address the applicability of the proximity requirements to mobile applications and text messages. Section 1005.31(c)(2) states that the exchange rate disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) generally must be disclosed in close proximity to the other information required by § 1005.31(b)(1). The abbreviated statement about the sender's error resolution and cancellation rights required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) generally must be disclosed in close proximity to the other information required by § 1005.31(b)(2). Disclosures provided orally or via mobile application or text message, to the extent permitted by § 1005.31(a)(5), need not comply with the proximity requirements of § 1005.31(c)(2).</analysisParagraph>

                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(c)(3) set forth the requirements regarding the prominence and size of the disclosures required under subpart B. The proposed rule provided that written and electronic disclosures required by subpart B must be made in a minimum eight-point font. The Board solicited comment on whether a minimum font size should be required and, if so, whether an eight-point font size is appropriate.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter supported the eight-point font requirement. However, other industry commenters urged the Bureau to eliminate the eight-point font requirement. These commenters argued that the font requirement would add unnecessary compliance costs that did not have a corresponding consumer benefit. Industry commenters argued that the font requirement may not create the desired consistency in disclosures, because, for example, fonts may display differently on different screens and printers. Rather, these commenters believed the Bureau should only require that the disclosures be subject to either a clear and conspicuous or clear and readily understandable standard.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that disclosures should be disclosed in at least an eight-point font, as proposed. As discussed in the proposal, the disclosures that the Board developed for consumer testing used eight-point font, consistent with the font size typically used in register receipts. Participants in the Board's consumer testing generally found that the disclosures were readable, and they were able to locate the different disclosure elements during testing. The Bureau agrees with the Board that disclosures provided in a smaller font could diminish the readability and noticeability of the disclosures. Therefore, the eight-point font requirement is generally retained in the final rule. However, given the particular concerns raised above with respect to mobile disclosures, the final rule does not apply the font requirement to disclosures made by mobile application or text message, to the extent permitted by § 1005.31(a)(5).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(c)(3) further provided that written disclosures required by subpart B must be on the front of the page on which the disclosure is printed. The proposed paragraph also provided that each of the written and electronic disclosures required under proposed § 205.31(b) must be in equal prominence to each other. One industry commenter asked the Bureau to clarify how written and electronic disclosures should be disclosed in equal prominence to each other. As discussed in the proposal, disclosures that must be equally prominent to each other should be displayed in the same font and type size.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting the prominence and size requirement substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(c)(3), with revisions to address the applicability of the font size requirement to mobile applications and text messages and revisions to better clarify that only disclosures provided in writing or electronically must be provided in equal prominence to each other and in eight-point font. Section 1005.31(c)(3) states that written disclosures required by subpart B must be provided on the front of the page on which the disclosure is printed. Disclosures required by subpart B that are provided in writing or electronically must be in a minimum eight-point font, except for disclosures provided via mobile application or text message to the extent permitted by § 1005.31(a)(5). Disclosures required by § 1005.31(b) that are provided in writing or electronically must be in equal prominence to each other.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>31(c)(4) Segregation</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(c)(4) provided that written and electronic disclosures required by subpart B must be segregated from everything else and contain only information that is directly related to the disclosures required under subpart B. Proposed comment 31(c)(4)-1 clarified how a remittance transfer provider could segregate disclosures. Proposed comment 31(c)(4)-2 identified information that would be considered directly related to the required disclosures, for purposes of determining what information must be segregated from the required disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed the segregation of required disclosures from other information to avoid overloading the sender with information that could distract from the required disclosures. In permitting directly related information to be included with the required disclosures, the Board recognized that certain information not required by the statute or regulation could be integral to the transaction. The Board stated that remittance transfer providers should be able to communicate this information, such as the confirmation code that a designated recipient must provide in order to receive the funds, to a sender. The Board requested comment on the proposed segregation requirement and whether additional information should be permitted to be included with the required segregated disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters requested further guidance on the segregation requirement, including clarification regarding how disclosures presented on a computer screen could be segregated, and whether disclosures would be considered segregated in a variety of mailing scenarios, including when disclosures are mailed on or with a periodic statement. The Bureau believes proposed comment 31(c)(4)-1 provides sufficient guidance to enable providers to determine whether the disclosures are segregated in a variety of scenarios. For example, the comment requires segregated disclosures to be set off from other information, such as disclosures required by states, but does not require the information to be displayed on a separate sheet of paper. The comment also explains that disclosures may be set off from other information on a notice by outlining them in a box or series of boxes, with bold print dividing lines or a different color background, or by using other means. A provider could apply this guidance to develop, for example, segregated disclosures set off in a box on a periodic statement or set off with a different color background on a computer screen. Therefore, the Bureau is finalizing comment 31(c)(4)-1 substantially as proposed, but adds another example for clarity.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters also suggested that certain additional information should be deemed “directly related” to the required disclosures, such that it would not have to be segregated from the required disclosures. Suggested additions included information regarding the retrieval of funds, such as the number of days the funds will be available to the recipient before the funds are returned to the sender, and a statement that a provider makes money from foreign currency exchange. The Bureau agrees that this information is directly related to the required disclosures and need not be segregated from them. Therefore, the Bureau is adding these to the list of “directly related” items in comment 31(c)(4)-2.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting the segregation requirement substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(c)(4), with revisions to address the applicability of the requirement to mobile applications and text messages and revisions to better clarify that only disclosures provided in writing or electronically must be segregated. Section 1005.31(c)(4) states that except for disclosures provided via mobile application or text message, to the extent permitted by § 1005.31(a)(5), disclosures required by subpart B that are provided in writing or electronically must be segregated from everything else and must contain only information that is directly related to the disclosures required under subpart B. Comment 31(c)(4)-1 of the final rule clarifies that disclosures may be segregated from other information in a variety of ways. For example, the disclosures may appear on a separate sheet of paper or may be set off from other information on a notice by outlining them in a box or series of boxes, with bold print dividing lines or a different color background, or by using other means.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(c)(4)-2 in the final rule clarifies that, for purposes of § 1005.31(c)(4), the following is directly related information: (i) The date and time of the transaction; (ii) the sender's name and contact information; (iii) the location at which the designated recipient may pick up the funds; (iv) the confirmation or other identification code; (v) a company name and logo; (vi) an indication that a disclosure is or is not a receipt or other indicia of proof of payment; (vii) a designated area for signatures or initials; (viii) a statement that funds may be available sooner, as permitted by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii); (ix) instructions regarding the retrieval of funds, such as the number of days the funds will be available to the recipient before they are returned to the sender; and (x) a statement that the provider makes money from foreign currency exchange.</analysisParagraph>

The proposed rule provided that such disclosures must be described as estimates, using the term “Estimated,” or a substantially similar term, in close proximity to the estimated term or terms described. As discussed in the proposal, consumer testing participants generally understood that where the term “estimated” was used in close proximity to the estimated term or terms, the actual amount could vary (for example, the amount of currency to be received could be higher or lower than the amount disclosed). Proposed comment 31(d)-1 provided examples of terms that may be used to indicate that a disclosed amount is estimated. For instance, a remittance transfer provider could describe an estimated disclosure as “Estimated Transfer Amount,” “Other Estimated Fees and Taxes,” or “Total to Recipient (Est.).” A Member of Congress and consumer group commenters agreed that the Bureau should require disclosures to be labeled as estimates when estimates are used.

                <title>31(e)(1) Timing of Pre-Payment and Combined Disclosures</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(e)(1) provided that a pre-payment disclosure required by § 205.31(b)(1) or a combined disclosure provided under § 205.31(b)(3) must be provided to the sender when the sender requests the remittance transfer, but prior to payment for the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters strongly supported requiring these disclosures to be provided before payment, stating that providing pre-payment disclosures was a centerpiece of the statute. One consumer group commenter stated that pre-payment disclosures were necessary to facilitate shopping.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters, however, opposed the requirement to provide disclosures before payment. One industry trade association commenter argued that the disclosure would provide negligible benefits, citing the fact that some participants in the Board's consumer testing stated that they did not want a disclosure prior to payment. One industry commenter suggested that the pre-payment disclosures would confuse or irritate customers who would not understand why disclosure was being provided at that time. Another industry commenter stated that the pre-payment disclosures created needless compliance costs, which would be passed on to senders. As discussed above, some industry commenters urged that if pre-payment disclosures were required, that they be permitted to be disclosed orally or on a screen, even when the transaction is conducted in person, to reduce compliance costs and delays for the sender.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>A few industry commenters argued that the combined disclosure should be permitted to be provided after payment is made. One industry commenter noted that EFTA section 919(a)(5)(C) only requires combined disclosure to be accurate at the time payment is made. This commenter stated that providing a document similar to a receipt prior to payment is not possible because such a disclosure could not provide accurate information regarding the date and time of the transaction, the amount paid, and the transaction number, which are elements that help establish proof of payment. Therefore, this commenter argued that the rule should permit the combined disclosure to be provided after payment, if a pre-payment disclosure is provided orally or on a screen at the point-of-sale. This commenter maintained that allowing oral or electronic disclosures would be appropriate in the context of EFTA section 919(a)(5) authority to permit combined disclosures and in light of the Bureau's duty to consider the final rule's costs and benefits. At minimum, this commenter believed the Bureau should permit this method of disclosure for senders who have used the provider's service in the past.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Another industry commenter stated that it currently only had the capability of providing information to senders on a register receipt after payment. This commenter believed that requiring a combined disclosure to be provided prior to payment would require printing a pre-payment disclosure in the middle of a sales transaction.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau recognizes the operational challenges associated with providing pre-payment and particularly combined disclosures to senders prior to payment. However, although current practice generally is to provide written disclosures after payment is made, the statute clearly requires certain disclosures to be provided prior to payment and other disclosures to be provided when payment is made for the remittance transfer. The Bureau also believes that the statute precludes combined disclosures from being provided to senders after payment or in a non-written format. EFTA section 919(a)(5)(C) affirmatively requires that the combined disclosure be <em data-original="E-03">accurate at the time at which payment is made</em> (emphasis added). Such a requirement would be superfluous if the combined disclosure could be provided after payment because a disclosure provided after payment must accurately reflect the terms of the completed transaction pursuant to EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B). Accordingly, the Bureau believes the statute requires both the pre-payment disclosure and the combined disclosure be given prior to payment.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As discussed below in § 1005.36, special timing rules have been adopted for preauthorized remittance transfers to account for the particular challenges associated with providing disclosures for transfers that may occur far in the future. Therefore, proposed § 205.31(e)(1) is adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(e)(1), with modifications to reference new § 1005.36. Section 1005.31(e)(1) states that except as provided in § 1005.36(a), a pre-payment disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(1) or a combined disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(3) must be provided to the sender when the sender requests the remittance transfer, but prior to payment for the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(e)-1 clarified when a sender has requested a remittance transfer, for purposes of determining when a pre-payment or combined disclosure must be provided. The proposed comment is adopted substantially as proposed, with a reference to the provisions for preauthorized remittance transfers in new § 1005.36. Comment 31(e)-1 states that, except as provided in § 1005.36(a), pre-payment and combined disclosures are required to be provided to the sender when the sender requests the remittance transfer, but prior to payment for the transfer. The comment clarifies that whether a consumer has requested a remittance transfer depends on the facts and circumstances. A sender that asks a provider to send a remittance transfer, and that provides transaction-specific information to the provider in order to send funds to a designated recipient, has requested a remittance transfer. For example, a sender who asks the provider to send money to a recipient in Mexico and provides the sender and recipient information to the provider has requested the remittance transfer provider to send a remittance transfer. In contrast, a consumer who solely inquires about that day's rates and fees to send to Mexico has not requested the remittance transfer provider to send a remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>31(e)(2) Timing of Receipts</title>
                <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B) requires that a receipt be provided to a sender at the time the sender makes payment in connection with the remittance transfer. Proposed § 205.31(e)(2) provided that a receipt must be provided to the sender when payment is made for the transaction. The Bureau did not receive comment on this proposed provision. Under the final rule, a receipt required to be provided by § 1005.31(b)(2) generally must be provided to the sender when payment is made for the remittance transfer, except for preauthorized remittance transfers as provided in § 1005.36(a). The Bureau notes that the final rule does not require the receipt to be provided at an exact moment when the sender, for example, hands cash or a credit card to an agent to pay for the transfer. Rather, the Bureau believes that payment for a remittance transfer is a process that may involve several steps. For example, payment for a transfer by credit card could involve a sender handing a credit card to an agent, the agent asking the sender for identification, the agent sending the credit card authorization request, the card authorization being approved, the agent requesting signature on a credit card receipt, and the sender signing the credit card receipt.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(e)-2 provided examples of when a remittance transfer provider may provide the sender a receipt. The Bureau did not receive comment on the proposed comment, which is adopted substantially as proposed. Comment 31(e)-2 in the final rule, however, adds a reference to the special timing rules for preauthorized remittance transfers in § 1005.36. The comment also adds a clarification regarding when a payment is made for purposes of the final rule, including an example stating that, for purposes of subpart B, payment is made when a sender authorizes a payment. The Bureau believes that, for purposes of subpart B, payment is made when a sender authorizes payment because a receipt will be most useful to a sender at that time. Otherwise, if payment is considered to be made when the funds actually leave the sender's account due to delays in processing a payment, a receipt may not be provided to a sender for a day or more. Furthermore, it is not clear how a sender's cancellation right would operate in this scenario. For example, because a sender does not know when funds leave an account, a sender would be unable to know when the cancellation right would be triggered.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(e)-2 in the final rule states that except as provided in § 1005.36(a), a receipt required by § 1005.31(b)(2) must be provided to the sender when payment is made for the remittance transfer. For example, a remittance transfer provider could give the sender the disclosures after the sender pays for the remittance transfer in person, but before the sender leaves the counter. A provider could also give the sender the disclosures immediately before the sender pays for the transaction. For purposes of subpart B, payment is made, for example, when a sender provides cash to the remittance transfer provider or when payment is authorized.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(e)(2) further stated that if a transaction is conducted entirely by telephone, a written receipt may be mailed or delivered to the sender no later than one business day after the date on which payment is made for the remittance transfer. If a transaction is conducted entirely by telephone and involves the transfer of funds from the sender's account held by the provider, the written receipt may be provided on or with the next regularly scheduled periodic statement. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> EFTA section 919(a)(5)(B). In some circumstances, a provider conducting such a transfer from the sender's account held by the provider is not required to provide a periodic statement under other laws. The Board believed that in such circumstances, it would be appropriate to permit the provider to provide a written receipt within a similar period of time as a periodic statement. Therefore, pursuant to EFTA section 904(c), the Board also proposed in § 205.31(e)(2) that the written receipt may be provided within 30 days after payment is made for the remittance transfer if a periodic statement is not required. Under the proposal, in order for the written receipt to be mailed or delivered to a sender conducting a transaction entirely by telephone at these later times, the remittance transfer provider was required to comply with the foreign language requirements of proposed § 205.31(g)(3).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter argued that the Bureau should include a timing exception in circumstances where a receipt is required to be provided to a sender shortly before a periodic statement is produced. This commenter stated that a remittance transfer provider may not be able to provide the required disclosures to a sender for a remittance transfer that occurs at the end of a billing cycle in time to include in the statement. The commenter suggested that in such circumstances, the Bureau should permit the receipt to be provided by the later of the next periodic statement date or 30 days after payment. The Bureau believes the final rule gives providers sufficient time to provide a receipt to a sender after a remittance transfer is sent; thus, no accommodation for transfers made at the end of a billing cycle is included in § 1005.31(e)(2). Because periodic statements must include certain information that occurs during a cycle, <em data-original="E-03">see</em> § 1005.9(b), the Bureau expects that, for purposes unrelated to this rule, providers already delay sending a periodic statement for a short time after a cycle ends to ensure that all activity occurring within a cycle is included in the appropriate statement.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and to facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA section 904(a) and (c) to adopt the provisions regarding mailing a receipt in proposed § 205.31(e)(2) as § 1005.31(e)(2) with revisions. Section 1005.31(e)(2) in the final rule eliminates the requirement to comply with proposed § 205.31(g)(3), because the provision has been eliminated in the final rule, as discussed in further detail below. Section 1005.31(e)(2) is also revised to state that if a transaction is conducted entirely by telephone and involves the transfer of funds from the sender's account held by the provider, the receipt may be provided within 30 days after payment is made for the remittance transfer if a periodic statement is not <em data-original="E-03">provided,</em> rather than if a periodic statement is not required. In some circumstances, a provider may provide a sender with a periodic statement even if one is not required to be provided. In these circumstances, the Bureau believes a provider should instead disclose the receipt on or with the periodic statement and that the provision allowing a provider to give a receipt 30 days after payment is made should not apply.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(e)(2) is further revised to account for circumstances in which a provider discloses the statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv), in order to use the telephone exceptions pursuant to § 1005.31(a)(3)(iii) or (a)(5)(iii). In those circumstances, the Bureau does not believe a provider should be required to repeat the statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation on a receipt when it has already been disclosed to the sender. Thus, pursuant to the Bureau's authority under EFTA section 919(d)(3), § 1005.31(e)(2) states that the statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) may, but need not, be disclosed pursuant to the timing requirements of § 1005.31(e)(2) if a provider discloses this information pursuant to § 1005.31(a)(3)(iii) or (a)(5)(iii). The Bureau also adds comment 31(e)(2)-5 to clarify that even though the statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation need not be disclosed pursuant to the timing requirements of § 1005.31(e)(2), the statement about the rights of the sender regarding error resolution required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) must be disclosed pursuant to the timing requirements of § 1005.31(e)(2).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(e)-3 provided further clarification regarding circumstances where a sender transfers funds from his or her account, as defined by § 205.2(b) (currently § 1005.2(b)), that is held by the remittance transfer provider. The Bureau did not receive comment on proposed comment 31(e)-3, which is adopted substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is providing further guidance in the final rule regarding the timing of receipts for remittance transfers made via mobile application or text message. As discussed above, because remittance transfers sent via mobile application or text message are conducted entirely by mobile telephone, the Bureau believes that EFTA section 919(a)(5)(A) permits pre-payment disclosures to be provided orally for such transfers. Similarly, the Bureau believes that that EFTA section 919(a)(5)(B) permits receipts for transfers sent entirely by telephone via mobile application or text message to be provided in accordance with the mailing rules provided for transactions conducted entirely by telephone in § 1005.31(e)(2) or § 1005.36(a). Therefore, the final rule adds a new comment 31(e)-4 to clarify that if a transaction is conducted entirely by telephone via mobile application or text message, a receipt required by § 1005.31(b)(2) may be mailed or delivered to the sender pursuant to the timing requirements in § 1005.31(e)(2) or § 1005.36(a). For example, if a sender conducts a transfer entirely by telephone via mobile application, a remittance transfer provider may mail or deliver the disclosures to a sender pursuant to the timing requirements in § 1005.31(e)(2) or § 1005.36(a).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Finally, several industry commenters requested that the Bureau specifically permit remittance transfer providers to provide receipts for transactions conducted via mobile application or text message by email or through a provider's Web site. The Bureau notes that written receipts provided in accordance with § 1005.31(e)(2) or § 1005.36(a) may be provided electronically, subject to compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 31(a)(2)-1.</analysisParagraph>

Proposed comment 31(f)-1 clarified that a remittance transfer provider did not have to guarantee the terms of the remittance transfer in the disclosures required by § 205.31(b) for any specific period of time. However, if any of the disclosures required by proposed § 205.31(b) are not accurate when a sender pays for the remittance transfer, a provider would be required to give new disclosures before receiving payment for the remittance transfer. For example, a sender at a retail store may be provided a pre-payment disclosure under proposed § 205.31(b)(1) at a customer service desk, but the sender may decide to leave the desk to go shopping. Upon the sender's return to the customer service desk an hour later, the sender would have to be provided a new pre-payment disclosure if any of the information had changed. However, the sender would not need to be provided a new disclosure if the information had not changed.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters supported the requirement that disclosures must be accurate when payment is made. An industry trade association commenter asked the Bureau to permit remittance transfer providers to include a statement in the disclosures clarifying that changes to the disclosures may occur between the time of payment and the time a transaction clears. However, the Bureau notes that under the proposed rule, only disclosures provided before payment is made would not be guaranteed and thus subject to change. Disclosures provided on receipts generally would be guaranteed, and thus not subject to change, except where estimates are permitted.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(f) is adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(f).

In light of the new disclaimer required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii), as well as the optional disclosures under that paragraph, the Bureau is making conforming edits to § 1005.31(f) and comment 31(f)-1 to note that the disclosures required by § 1005.31(b) or permitted by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) must be accurate when a sender makes payment for the remittance transfer, except to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32.  Comment 31(f)-1 further notes that while a remittance transfer provider is not required to guarantee the terms of the remittance transfer in the disclosures required or permitted by § 1005.31(b) for any specific period of time, if any of the disclosures required or permitted by § 1005.31(b) are not accurate when a sender makes payment for the remittance transfer, a provider must give new disclosures before accepting payment.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that extending the accuracy requirement to the optional disclosures regarding non-covered third party fees and taxes collected by persons other than the remittance transfer provider is necessary in order to communicate accurately to the sender how confident the remittance transfer provider is concerning the information provided.  As discussed above, the Bureau believes that such information can be useful to senders under certain circumstances and hopes to encourage use of increasingly reliable information over time.  Although the vast majority of remittance transfer providers may choose to disclose any numbers provided as estimates due to the various uncertainties with regard to foreign taxes and fees discussed above, the Bureau believes it is important to preserve remittance transfer providers' ability to compete based on disclosure of actual figures.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>31(g) Foreign Language Disclosures</title>
              <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(b) provides that disclosures required under EFTA section 919 must be made in English and in each of the foreign languages principally used by the remittance transfer provider, or any of its agents, to advertise, solicit, or market, either orally or in writing, at that office. The Board proposed § 205.31(g)(1) to implement EFTA section 919(b) for written or electronic disclosures generally, with some modifications as discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule. In addition, the Board proposed § 205.31(g)(2) and (3) to exempt from the general foreign language disclosure requirements oral disclosures and written receipts for telephone transactions. The Bureau is adopting § 205.31(g) in renumbered § 1005.31(g) generally as proposed with some changes in response to suggestions from commenters, as discussed in detail below.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisSection>
                <title>31(g)(1) General</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(g)(1) provided that disclosures required under subpart B, other than oral disclosures and written receipts for telephone transactions, must be made in English and in each of the foreign languages principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfer services, either orally, in writing, or electronically, at that office. Alternatively, proposed § 205.31(g)(1) provided that these disclosures may be made in English, and, if applicable, in the foreign language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction (or for written or electronic disclosures made pursuant to proposed § 205.33, in the foreign language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to assert the error), provided that such foreign language is principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfer services, either orally, in writing, or electronically, at that office.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, proposed § 205.31(g)(1) contained certain exceptions and clarifications to the requirements of EFTA section 919(b). Specifically, the Board proposed: (i) To apply the provisions only to written or electronic disclosures and address oral disclosures separately in proposed § 205.31(g)(2); (ii) to simplify the statutory language in EFTA section 919(b) by removing the term “or its agents;” (iii) to include electronic advertising, soliciting or marketing as a trigger to the foreign language disclosure requirements, in addition to oral and written advertisements, solicitations, or marketing; (iv) to limit the trigger to foreign language advertisements, solicitations, or marketing of remittance transfer services, and to exclude from the trigger foreign language advertisements, solicitations, or marketing of other products or services; and (v) to permit, under its EFTA section 904(c) authority, a remittance transfer provider to fulfill its obligations by providing the sender with disclosures in English and, if applicable, the one triggered foreign language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction or assert an error in lieu of providing disclosures in each of the triggered foreign languages.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Commenters did not object to these specific proposed modifications. However, several industry commenters stated that the foreign language disclosure requirements generally would provide a disincentive for remittance transfer providers to provide a wide range of foreign language services to customers. Some of these commenters suggested that if remittance transfer providers were to offer fewer foreign language services, this would drive some customers to use illicit operators who provide the foreign-language services discontinued by legitimate remittance transfer providers. Another commenter suggested that the disclosures should only be provided in English because the foreign language requirement would impose costs that would be passed on to consumers who might not derive any benefit from such services.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters and a member of Congress, however, thought the rule should ensure that non- and limited-English speaking consumers have access to meaningful remittance transfer disclosures. The Congressional commenter also agreed with the Board's proposal to extend the advertising, soliciting, or marketing trigger to electronic advertisements, solicitations, and marketing.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(b) requires disclosures to be provided in certain foreign languages, and the Bureau believes the Board's proposed modifications to the statutory requirements alleviates burden on remittance transfer providers. The Bureau believes that proposed § 205.31(g)(1) reflects a proper balancing of interests in providing non- and limited-English speaking consumers with disclosures in a language with which they are familiar with the burden on remittance transfer providers of providing multilingual disclosures in implementing EFTA section 919(b). The statute and the implementing regulation seek to ensure that if remittance transfer providers make a concerted effort to reach out to potential remittance transfer customers through advertisements, solicitations, and marketing in a foreign language in a particular office, then such providers should also be required to provide important disclosures in that language when such customers come to that office to purchase remittance transfer services from that provider or assert an error.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, the Bureau agrees with the Board's proposed modifications and clarifications to the statutory language for the reasons discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, and commenters did not object to such modifications and clarifications. Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA section 904(a) and (c) to adopt proposed § 205.31(g)(1) in renumbered § 1005.31(g)(1), with the removal of a reference to proposed § 205.31(g)(3) regarding written receipts for telephone transactions, which is further discussed below, and other minor technical and clarifying amendments. Most notably, the Bureau is changing the references to “that office” in the proposed rule to “the office in which a sender conducts a transaction or asserts an error” for clarity.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisSection>
                  <title>Principally Used</title>
                  <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(g)(1)-1 clarified when a foreign language is principally used. As the Board stated in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the statute indicates that more than one foreign language may be principally used. Consequently, the Board's interpretation of the term “principally used” was not limited to the one foreign language used most frequently by the remittance transfer provider. Instead, proposed comment 31(g)(1)-1 adopted a facts-and-circumstances approach to determining when a foreign language is principally used. Under proposed comment 31(g)(1)-1, factors contributing to whether a foreign language is principally used would include: (i) The frequency with which the remittance transfer provider advertises, solicits, or markets remittance transfers in a foreign language at a particular office; (ii) the prominence of such advertising, soliciting, or marketing in that language at that office; and (iii) the specific foreign language terms used to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfer services at that office. Proposed comment 31(g)(1)-1 also included examples to illustrate when a foreign language is principally used and when there is incidental use of the language. As discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the Board also considered an objective standard based on whether a foreign language meets a certain percentage threshold of a remittance transfer provider's advertisements at a particular office. However, the Board rejected such a standard based on the fact that the standard may be arbitrary, may be difficult to administer, and may inappropriately exclude instances where a foreign language is principally used to advertise, solicit or market remittance transfers, even if the number of advertisements in the foreign language is nominally low.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters suggested that there be further clarification on the term “principally used,” but did not specifically state what kind of guidance would be helpful. A consumer group commenter agreed with the proposed facts-and-circumstances approach for determining foreign languages principally used in advertising, soliciting, or marketing remittance transfer services. A member of Congress agreed with the Board's interpretation that the statutory provision contemplated that more than one foreign language could be principally used.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with the Board's reasoning in proposing comment 31(g)(1)-1. Because the Bureau believes the particular facts and circumstances surrounding the use of a foreign language to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers will determine whether a foreign language is “principally used” to advertise, solicit, or market at a particular office, the Bureau does not believe further general statements would be helpful. However, the Bureau is amending one of the illustrative examples in comment 31(g)(1)-1 to provide a more clear example of when a remittance transfer provider would be considered to be principally using a foreign language to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers at an office.</analysisParagraph>

                <analysisSection>
                  <title>Advertise, Solicit, or Market</title>
                  <analysisParagraph>Neither the EFTA nor Regulation E defines “advertising,” “soliciting,” or “marketing.”<footnote ref="77">Regulation E contains some guidance on whether a card, code, or other device is “marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate” or “marketed to the general public” for purposes of the requirements pertaining to gift cards. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; comments 20(b)(2)-2, 20(b)(2)-3, and 20(b)(4)-1. However, that guidance focuses on a narrow set of circumstances and does not address more broadly what actions generally constitute advertising, soliciting, or marketing.</footnote>
                    However, the general concept of advertising, soliciting, or marketing is explained in other regulations administered by the Bureau. <em data-original="E-03">See, e.g.,</em> Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.2(a)(2) and associated commentary; Regulation DD, 12 CFR 1030.2(b) and 1030.11(b) and associated commentary.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed comment 31(g)(1)-2 to provide positive and negative examples of advertising, soliciting, or marketing in a foreign language. These examples were based on examples from the commentary to other regulations (specifically, renumbered §§ 1026.2(a)(2) and 1030.2(b)) regarding the definition of “advertisement,” as well as examples related to the promotion of overdrafts under § 1030.11(b). Some industry commenters asked whether the terms “market” and “solicit” mean something different than “advertise” and requested definitions for “market” or “solicit” if they are meant to have different meanings. The Bureau believes, that for purposes of subpart B of Regulation E, the terms “advertise,” “solicit” and “market” have the same general meaning, and comment 31(g)(1)-2 is adopted substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
                </analysisSection>
                <analysisSection>
                  <title>At the Office</title>
                  <analysisParagraph>Under EFTA section 919(b) and proposed § 205.31(g)(1), foreign language disclosures would be required when the foreign language is principally used to advertise, solicit, or market “at that office.” As discussed above, the Bureau is changing the reference in § 1005.31(g)(1) from “that office” to “the office in which a sender conducts a transaction or asserts an error” for clarity in the final rule. The Board proposed comment 31(g)(1)-3 to clarify the meaning of “office.” As discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, proposed 31(g)(1)-3 reflected the Board's belief that an office includes both physical and non-physical locations where remittance transfer services are offered to consumers, including any telephone number or Web site through which a consumer can complete a transaction or assert an error. The Board further noted that a telephone number or Web site that provides general information about the remittance transfer provider, but through which a consumer does not have the ability to complete a transaction or assert an error, is not an office. Proposed comment 31(g)(1)-3 also clarified that a location need not exclusively offer remittance transfer services in order to be considered an office for purposes of § 1005.31(g)(1) (proposed as § 205.31(g)(1)), and included an example to illustrate this point.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters requested clarification on whether a Web site targeted to consumers outside of the United States could be an “office” for purposes of the foreign language disclosure requirements. In response, the Bureau is revising comment 31(g)(1)-3 to clarify that because a consumer must be located in a State to be considered a “sender” under § 1005.30(g), a Web site is not an “office,” even if the Web site can be accessed by consumers that are located in the United States, unless a sender may conduct a remittance transfer on the Web site or may assert an error for a remittance transfer on the Web site. Therefore, a Web site that is targeted to people outside of the United States will not be deemed to be an “office” for purposes of § 1005.31(g) so long as senders cannot conduct a remittance transfer on the Web site or assert an error for a remittance transfer on the Web site.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Board also proposed comment 31(g)(1)-4 to provide guidance on the phrase “at that office.” Proposed comment 31(g)(1)-4 stated that advertisements, solicitations, or marketing posted, provided, or made at a physical office, on a Web site of a remittance transfer provider, or during a telephone call with the remittance transfer provider would constitute advertising, soliciting, or marketing at an office of a remittance transfer provider. The proposed comment also clarified that for error resolution disclosures, the relevant office would be the office in which the sender first asserts the error and not the office where the remittance transfer was conducted.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter requested clarification on a number of situations where the remittance transfer provider may be engaging in general advertising, marketing, or soliciting that is not intended to be made at a particular office, but due to the nature of such advertising, marketing, or soliciting, it happens to occur at a particular office. The Bureau agrees that such a clarification is appropriate and has revised comment 31(g)(1)-4 to state that an advertisement, solicitation, or marketing that is considered to be made at an office does not include general advertisements, solicitations, or marketing that are not intended to be made at a particular office. The proposed comment includes an example to illustrate this concept. Specifically, if an advertisement for remittance transfers in Chinese appears in a Chinese newspaper that is being distributed at a grocery store in which the agent of a remittance transfer provider is located, such advertisement would not be considered to be made at that office.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also amending comment 31(g)(1)-4 to provide that advertisements, soliciting, or marketing posted, provided, or made via mobile application or text message would also be considered advertising, soliciting, or marketing at an office of a remittance transfer provider. The amendment is consistent with the Bureau's other revisions in the final rule clarifying that transfers through mobile application or text message are considered to be transfers conducted by telephone. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(a)(5). The Bureau is also making other minor amendments to comment 31(g)(1)-4 for additional clarity, including changing “that office” to “the office in which a sender conducts a transaction or asserts an error” to be consistent with the change the Bureau is adopting in § 1005.31(g)(1). Based on this change, comment 31(g)(1)-4 also contains a clarification that for disclosures required under § 1005.31, the relevant office would be the office in which the sender conducts the transaction.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisSection>
                <title>31(g)(2) Oral, Mobile Application or Text Message Disclosures</title>
                <analysisParagraph>In the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the Board proposed to use its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to exempt oral disclosures from the foreign language requirement under EFTA section 919(b). In proposed § 205.31(g)(2), the Board proposed to use its authority under EFTA section 919(a)(5)(A) to permit oral disclosures for transactions conducted entirety by telephone, subject to the requirement that they be made in the language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction. Proposed § 205.31(g)(2) also provided that disclosures permitted to be provided orally under proposed § 205.31(a)(4) for error resolution purposes must be made in the language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to assert the error.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters thought that the rule should not require disclosures in any foreign language that is not principally used to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers. These commenters suggested that such a requirement could hurt consumers by reducing the number of languages that a remittance transfer provider would be willing to use to conduct a transaction.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>However, as the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, if a foreign language must be principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers in order to trigger the foreign language requirement for oral disclosures, a sender conducting a transaction or asserting an error in a foreign language on the telephone that did not meet the foreign language advertising trigger may only receive required oral disclosures in English. Consequently, if the remittance transfer provider conducted the actual transaction or communicated with the sender regarding the alleged error in a foreign language, a remittance transfer provider could then switch to English to orally disclose the required information under such a rule. The Bureau believes that senders would benefit from having the required oral disclosures provided in the same language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction or assert the error, regardless of whether the language meets the foreign language advertising trigger. Failure to include this modification from the general foreign language requirement for oral disclosures could lead to consumers not understanding the required disclosures, which would be contrary to the goals and purposes of the statute.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, the Bureau agrees with the Board's reasoning in the May 2011 Proposed Rule that disclosures provided orally under § 1005.31(a)(3) and (4) should be provided only in the language primarily used to conduct the transaction or assert the error. Otherwise, under EFTA section 919(b), a sender conducting a telephone transaction orally or receiving the results of an error investigation orally could be given disclosures in English and in every foreign language triggered by the regulation, which would likely lead to consumer confusion. While the Bureau recognizes that this rule might reduce the languages in which a remittance transfer provider would be willing to conduct a transaction, the Bureau believes that applying the general foreign language disclosure rule to oral disclosures would be harmful to consumers for the reasons set forth above.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Moreover, as discussed above, the Bureau is adopting § 1005.31(a)(5) to permit disclosures to be provided orally or via mobile application or text message for transactions conducted entirely by telephone via mobile application or text message. Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to adopt proposed § 205.31(g)(2) in renumbered § 1005.31(g)(2) with amendments to include a reference to transactions conducted entirely by telephone via mobile application or text message and other minor, non-substantive amendments.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisSection>
                  <title>Written Receipt for Telephone Transactions</title>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Board also proposed § 205.31(g)(3), which provided that written receipts for transactions conducted entirely by telephone must be made in English and, if applicable, in the foreign language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction, regardless of whether such foreign language is primarily used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers. The Board, however, requested comment on whether the general rule proposed in § 205.31(g)(1) (adopted as § 1005.31(g)(1) above) should apply to the written receipt provided for transactions conducted entirely by telephone. Adopting the general rule proposed in § 205.31(g)(1) for written receipts provided for transactions conducted entirely by telephone would mean that a remittance transfer provider would not be obligated to provide the written receipt in a foreign language, even if such foreign language was used to conduct the telephone transaction, unless the foreign language was principally used to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers during the telephone call.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>As noted above, some industry commenters thought that the rule should not require disclosures in any foreign language that is not principally used to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers because this might cause remittance transfer providers to reduce the number of languages they would be willing to use to conduct a remittance transfer. Another industry commenter stated that in its experience, consumers can understand written English even though they may prefer to conduct a transaction orally in their native language for the fluency, ease, and speed at which the transaction may be conducted when speaking in one's native language.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that applying the general rule under § 1005.31(g)(1) to written receipts provided to senders after payment would not cause the same type of consumer confusion as it would for pre-payment disclosures provided orally in transactions conducted entirely by telephone. Although some senders may not have enough familiarity with English to feel comfortable speaking with the remittance transfer provider in English, the same pressure to comprehend and respond quickly does not exist with written disclosures. Unlike with oral disclosures, senders have sufficient time to review written disclosures and, if necessary, find resources to help understand the disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, the Bureau notes that in the Board's outreach with industry, remittance transfer providers generally stated that providing written disclosures in a foreign language can be more costly and burdensome than providing oral disclosures in a foreign language. The Bureau also notes that a remittance transfer provider may have employees or agents that happen to speak a certain foreign language for which the provider does not have written disclosures. The Bureau would not want providers to discourage such employees or agents from using their foreign language skills to help senders with their remittance transfer transactions in order to avoid having to provide written disclosures in the language spoken by the employee or agent. In order to minimize the potential unintended consequence of having remittance transfer providers reduce the number of foreign languages they may offer for telephone transactions, the Bureau is not adopting proposed § 205.31(g)(3). Therefore, written receipts required to be provided to the sender after payment for transactions conducted entirely by telephone are subject to the general rule under § 1005.31(g)(1).</analysisParagraph>

                  <title>General Clarifications</title>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Board also proposed additional commentary in the May 2011 Proposed Rule to provide general guidance on issues that affect each of the subsections of proposed § 205.31(g) (adopted as § 1005.31(g)) discussed above. EFTA section 919(b) does not limit the number of languages that may be used on a single disclosure. However, proposed comment 31(g)-1 suggested that a single written or electronic document containing more than three languages is not likely to be helpful to a consumer. Since the proposed commentary was not a strict limit, the Board solicited comment on whether the regulation should strictly limit the number of languages that may be contained in a single written or electronic disclosure. The Board also sought comment on whether three languages is an appropriate suggested limit to the number of languages in a single written or electronic document.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter suggested that the rule cap the number of languages a remittance transfer provider would be required to disclose to three languages. The commenter also stated that requiring English, Spanish, and French would cover the vast majority of the languages used in transfers they send from the United States. This commenter also noted that other regulators that have required foreign language disclosures have typically limited the languages that must be disclosed to either English and Spanish, or a small subset of languages such as Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, and Korean. A consumer group commenter recommended that rather than adopting a ceiling on the number of languages that may appear on a disclosure, the Bureau should create guidelines that ensure disclosures with multiple foreign languages are easy to understand.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe that limiting the foreign languages that may be used by a remittance transfer provider best effectuates the goals of the statute. In the Bureau's view, if a remittance transfer provider principally uses a foreign language to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers at an office, the remittance transfer provider is deliberately reaching out to consumers speaking that foreign language, and the required disclosures should be provided in that foreign language, regardless of whether it is a language that is commonly used for remittance transfers originating in the United States. Furthermore, while too many languages on a single written document may diminish a consumer's ability to read and understand the disclosures, the Bureau believes that remittance transfer providers may find ways to present the information in a number of foreign languages that are clear and conspicuous to senders, and that imposing a definitive limit on the number of languages that may appear on a single disclosure may be too inflexible. Moreover, the Bureau believes that the formatting requirements in § 1005.31(c), as discussed above, may help to ensure that senders can find and understand the information that is most important to them with respect to the remittance transfer. The Bureau is amending comment 31(g)-1 to note that disclosures must be clear and conspicuous pursuant to § 1005.31(a)(1) without suggesting a specific limit on the number of languages in a single disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(g)-1 also clarified that the remittance transfer provider may provide disclosures in a single document with both languages or in two separate documents with one document in English and the other document in the applicable foreign language. The Board also proposed several examples in comment 31(g)-1 to illustrate the application of this concept.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters thought that senders should be able to designate the language in which they prefer to receive disclosures, provided it is a language that is principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers, instead of providing disclosures in both English and the applicable foreign language. The Bureau notes that EFTA section 919(b) requires disclosures to be provided in English and in each of the foreign languages principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market at that office. This means that regardless of which office a sender chooses to conduct a remittance transfer, he or she will always obtain written or electronic disclosures in English, even if the disclosure in a foreign language is not consistent among different offices because such disclosure will depend on whether the foreign language meets the foreign language disclosure trigger at that office. The Bureau believes that always disclosing in English is important to allow senders to compare disclosures received at different provider locations and for different providers. Therefore, the final rule requires remittance transfer providers to provide disclosures in English in all cases. This is fully consistent with EFTA section 919(b). Comment 31(g)-1 is adopted as proposed with some technical and clarifying amendments, including to remove references to § 205.31(g)(3), consistent with the Bureau's decision regarding written receipts for telephone transactions, as discussed above.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Board also proposed comment 31(g)-2 to clarify when a language is primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct a transaction and assert an error. A remittance transfer provider must determine the language that is primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct a transaction or assert an error if the provider chooses to provide written or electronic disclosures in English and the foreign language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction or to assert an error. Furthermore, under § 1005.31(g)(2), a remittance transfer provider is required to provide oral disclosures in the language that is primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction or assert an error.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Specifically, proposed comment 31(g)-2 clarified that the language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction is the primary language used to convey the information necessary to complete the transaction. Proposed comment 31(g)-2 also stated that the language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to assert an error is the primary language used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to provide the information required by § 1005.33(b) to assert an error. The proposed comment also provided examples to clarify this concept.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter suggested that the foreign language disclosure requirement should relate to the language used by the remittance transfer provider, rather than the language used by the sender. Some industry commenters recommended that the Bureau provide further clarification of the term “primarily used” without specifying what type of guidance would be helpful. The Bureau notes that proposed comment 31(g)-2 specifies that the relevant foreign language is the foreign language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct a transaction or assert an error, and the examples show that a foreign language must be used by both the sender and the remittance transfer provider to be primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct a transaction or assert an error. The Bureau believes the proposed commentary is clear on this point. However, as additional clarification, the Bureau is including a new example in comment 31(g)-2 to illustrate when a sender primarily uses a foreign language with a remittance transfer provider in the internet context.</analysisParagraph>

                  <title>Storefront and Internet Disclosures</title>
                  <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(6)(A) states that the Bureau may prescribe rules to require a remittance transfer provider to prominently post, and timely update, a notice describing a model remittance transfer for one or more amounts. The provision states that such a notice shall show the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient, using the values of the currency into which the funds will be exchanged. EFTA section 919(a)(6)(A) also states that the Bureau may require the notice prescribed to be displayed in every physical storefront location owned or controlled by the remittance transfer provider. Further, EFTA section 919(a)(6)(A) states that the Bureau shall prescribe rules to require a remittance transfer provider that provides remittance transfers via the internet to provide a notice, comparable to the storefront notice described in the statute, located on the home page or landing page (with respect to such remittance transfer services) owned or controlled by the remittance transfer provider.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(6)(B) states that, prior to proposing rules under EFTA section 919(a)(6)(A), appropriate studies and analyses must be performed to determine whether a storefront notice or internet notice facilitates the ability of a consumer to: (i) Compare prices for remittance transfers, and (ii) understand the types and amounts of any fees or costs imposed on remittance transfers. The studies and analyses must be consistent with EFTA section 904(a)(2), which requires an economic impact analysis that considers the costs and benefits of a regulation to financial institutions, consumers, and other users. These costs and benefits include the extent to which additional paperwork would be required, the effects upon competition in the provision of services among large and small financial institutions, and the availability of services to different classes of consumers, particularly low income consumers.<footnote ref="78">As discussed below, the Board performed an analysis in the proposed rule consistent with EFTA section 904(a)(2), as it existed prior to any amendments in the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 904(a)(2), however, did not apply and was not amended by the Dodd-Frank Act to apply to the Bureau. Regardless, the Board's analysis from the proposal is unchanged, and the Bureau concurs with the Board's analysis.</footnote></analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Consistent with EFTA section 919(a)(6)(B), the Board reviewed and analyzed the statute and a variety of independent articles, studies, and Congressional testimony; conducted outreach with industry and consumer advocates; and held focus groups with consumers who send remittance transfers. Based on its findings, summarized below, the Board concluded in the May 2011 Proposed Rule that the statutory notice would not facilitate a consumer's ability to compare prices or to understand the fees and costs imposed on remittance transfers.<footnote ref="79">A complete discussion of the Board's findings is available at 76 FR at 29924-29927.</footnote></analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The notice described by the statute illustrates only the exchange rate offered by that remittance transfer provider for the particular model transfer amount. In addition to the exchange rate, however, the total cost of a remittance transfer includes fees charged by the remittance transfer provider, any intermediary in the transfer, and the receiving entity. The total cost also includes any taxes that may be charged in the sending and receiving jurisdictions. Thus, the Board determined the statutory storefront notice would not present a complete picture to the consumer of all potential fees and costs for a remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>In the proposal, the Board considered two alternatives to the type of notice described in the statute that could more effectively communicate costs to a sender. The Board considered requiring the posting of transfer fee information for model send amounts, but believed that this alternative notice would have many of the same limitations as the statutory notice. The Board also considered requiring a notice that would reflect all the costs of a transfer. A notice with this alternative content could help consumers to obtain a better understanding of the total cost of a remittance transfer, but the length and complexity of such notices could limit their utility.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The analysis conducted by the Board identified other limitations with both the statutory and alternative storefront disclosures. First, most consumers would be unable to apply the information provided by the statutory notice to their own transfers. The fees, exchange rate, and taxes for a remittance transfer can vary based upon the amount sent, transfer corridor (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the sending location to the receiving location), speed of transfer (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> the next day, the same day, or in one hour), method of delivery (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> an electronic deposit into a bank account or a cash disbursement), and type of receiving entity (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> a bank or a money transmitter's payout partner). For example, some remittance transfer providers offer a discount on their exchange rate spread for large send amounts. Therefore, even if the consumer's transfer were identical to the model transfer posted in the storefront notice except for the send amount, the consumer still may be unable to determine the exchange rate that would apply to the consumer's transfer based on the storefront notice.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Moreover, a consumer could be overwhelmed by the amount of data appearing in a long, complex storefront notice posted by these providers and, therefore, might not use it. A storefront notice for sending a specified amount to a single country could contain multiple rows of information to account for differences in pricing based on the transfer method, timing option, receipt location, and cost permutations described above. Many providers offer remittance transfers to multiple countries, and several locations within each country, which would multiply the number of data points on the notice.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Finally, frequent fluctuations in exchange rates could result in disclosures being inaccurate for a period of time. Remittance transfer providers would have to update the storefront notice for each send location several times a week, or as frequently as several times a day, to account for the fluctuations in exchange rates. These rates could also be different at a single provider's different send locations. Remittance transfer providers would need to distribute the updated notices to each send location, and each send location would need to replace the outdated notice just as frequently. Non-exclusive send locations that offer the services of two or more money transmitters would have to post and update the storefront notices for each remittance transfer provider. As a result, a storefront notice could be unhelpful and even misleading to consumers, while creating unnecessary legal risks for remittance transfer providers.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The analysis also identified potential effects that the storefront notice requirement would have on competition and costs to the consumer. The work involved in posting and updating storefront notices could cause some agents to stop offering remittance transfers. Further, credit unions and small banks that infrequently conduct transfers could find the burden and cost of producing storefront notices prohibitive and discontinue the service. Given the costs and risks associated with posting and updating the storefront notices contemplated by the statute, some providers could decide to exit the market, which could reduce competition among providers and increase costs for consumers.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Because the Board did not propose a rule mandating the posting of storefront notices, it did not propose a rule mandating the posting of internet notices. Since the proposal did not require a storefront notice, there could be no “comparable” internet notice. Moreover, the Board's study of model internet notices indicated that consumers using internet remittance transfer providers to request remittance transfers would be less likely to use a model transfer notice than those using providers at a physical location. Many internet providers currently disclose transaction-specific information prior to the consumer's payment for a transfer, and § 1005.31(b)(1), discussed above, makes this practice a regulatory requirement.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters supported the findings that the storefront notice and internet notice would not be useful to consumers. One consumer group commenter believed that the Bureau should require any storefront advertising to be in a storefront disclosure format prescribed by the Bureau. The commenter argued that the storefront disclosure should include the amount a sender pays to a remittance transfer provider and the amount to be received by a recipient for at least two sample amounts. The commenter suggested that disclosures could be based on the cost at a certain time, such as the previous business day, to alleviate the concerns about disclosures needing to be updated more frequently.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with the Board's analysis, and believes that the storefront and internet disclosures described in EFTA section 919(a)(6)(A) would not accomplish the statutory goals of facilitating the ability of consumers to compare prices for remittance transfers and to understand the types and amounts of any fees or costs imposed on remittance transfers. The disclosures would not provide a complete disclosure of all of the costs of a remittance transfer. Even if all costs were provided in the disclosures, consumers would be unable to extrapolate from a storefront disclosure the cost of their particular transaction, because the cost could depend on other variables. The Bureau also recognizes the burden on remittance transfer providers could be significant and could lead some providers to no longer provide remittance services. The burden on providers would be substantial even if the disclosures were only required to be updated daily. Moreover, requiring less frequent updating would result in the disclosures being inaccurate for a period of time.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Because the cost to providers could be substantial, and the benefit of the storefront and internet disclosures would be minimal, the final rule does not require the posting of model remittance transfer notices at a storefront or on the internet.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>Section 1005.31 Disclosures</title>
            <analysisParagraph>Section 1073 of the Dodd-Frank Act imposes several disclosure requirements relating to remittance transfers. Among these, EFTA sections 919(a)(2)(A) and (B) require a remittance transfer provider to provide two sets of disclosures to a sender in connection with a remittance transfer. A remittance transfer provider must generally provide a written pre-payment disclosure to a sender when a sender requests a transfer. This disclosure provides information about the sender's remittance transfer, such as the exchange rate, fees, and the amount to be received by the designated recipient. A remittance transfer provider must also provide a written receipt to the sender when payment is made. This disclosure includes the information provided on the pre-payment disclosure, as well as additional information, such as the promised date of delivery, contact information for the designated recipient, and information regarding the sender's error resolution rights.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(5) provides the Bureau with certain exemption authority, including the authority to permit a remittance transfer provider to provide a single written disclosure to a sender, in lieu of providing both a pre-payment disclosure and receipt. This single disclosure must be provided to the sender prior to payment for the remittance transfer and must accurately disclose all of the information required on both the pre-payment disclosure and the receipt. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> EFTA section 919(a)(5)(C). EFTA section 919(b) also provides that disclosures under EFTA section 919 must be made in English and in each foreign language principally used by the remittance transfer provider, or any of its agents, to advertise, solicit, or market, either orally or in writing, at that office. The Board proposed § 205.31 to implement the content and formatting requirements for these disclosures, and the Bureau is finalizing these requirements in § 1005.31, as discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(a) sets forth the requirements for the general form of disclosures required under subpart B. Section 1005.31(b)(1) and (2) implement the pre-payment disclosure and receipt requirements of EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A) and (B). Section 1005.31(b)(3) sets forth the requirements for providing a combined disclosure, as permitted by EFTA section 919(a)(5)(C). Section 1005.31(b)(4) contains disclosure requirements relating to a sender's error resolution and cancellation rights. Section 1005.31(c) addresses specific format requirements for subpart B disclosures, including grouping, proximity, prominence and size, and segregation requirements. Section 1005.31(d) sets forth the disclosure requirements for providing estimates, to the extent they are permitted by § 1005.32. Section 1005.31(e) generally implements the timing requirements of EFTA sections 919(a)(2) and 919(a)(5)(C). Section 1005.31(f) clarifies that, except as provided in § 1005.36(b), disclosures required by § 1005.31 must be accurate when a sender makes payment for the remittance transfer, except to the extent permitted by § 1005.32. Finally, § 1005.31(g) contains the requirements for providing foreign language disclosures in certain circumstances.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>Overview</title>
              <analysisParagraph>In the February Proposal, the Bureau solicited comment on issues relating to disclosure of the cancellation requirements in § 1005.36(c) for remittance transfers scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer. To address these issues, the Bureau is amending the disclosure requirements in §§ 1005.31(a)(3), (a)(5), and (b)(2) to improve consumers' ability to determine the cancellation deadlines for particular transfers. In addition, the Bureau is amending § 1005.31(b)(3), regarding combined disclosures, to allow providers to give a confirmation that the transfer has been scheduled in lieu of the proof of payment required for transfers scheduled before payment is processed for the transfer. These amendments are discussed in detail in their respective sections below.</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisSection>
              <title>Disclosure of Deadline To Cancel Transfers Scheduled Before the Date of Transfer</title>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail below regarding § 1005.36(c), the February Final Rule adopts a cancellation policy for remittance transfers. Under § 1005.34(a) of the February Final Rule, a sender generally has 30 minutes after payment is made to cancel a remittance transfer. The February Final Rule, however, contains special cancellation procedures for any remittance transfer that is scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, including a series of preauthorized remittance transfers. For these transfers, the provider is required to cancel the remittance transfer if it receives a request to cancel from the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The February Proposal solicited comment on possible changes to the cancellation requirements for remittance transfers that are scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, including preauthorized remittance transfers. Specifically, the February Proposal solicited comment on whether the three-business-day period for cancelling such remittance transfers adopted in the February Final Rule is appropriate, or whether the rule should require a deadline to cancel these transfer that is more or less than three business days. The February Proposal also solicited comment on three issues related to the disclosure of the deadline to cancel as set forth in the February Final Rule. The first issue was whether the three-business-day deadline to cancel transfers scheduled before the date of the transfer should be disclosed differently to senders, such as by requiring a remittance transfer provider to disclose in the receipt the specific date on which the right to cancel will expire. The second issue was whether a provider should be allowed to describe both the three-business-day and 30-minute cancellation provisions on a single receipt and either describe the transfers to which each cancellation period is applicable, or alternatively, use a checkbox or other method to designate which cancellation period is applicable to the transfer to which the receipt relates. The third issue was whether the cancellation requirements should be disclosed in the pre-payment disclosure, rather than in the receipt, for each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The approaches taken in the final rule for the three-business-day cancellation period and the disclosures required to be provided in connection with subsequent remittance transfers within a series of preauthorized remittance transfers are described in greater detail below in the discussion regarding § 1005.36(c) and (d). Consistent with these provisions, the Bureau is also revising § 1005.31 to add new paragraphs (a)(3)(iv), (a)(5)(iv), and (b)(2)(vii), and associated commentary, regarding the content and format of the disclosures that must be provided to senders of transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer and of certain preauthorized remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Taken together, the final rule requires remittance transfer providers to disclose the date of transfer, and in certain instances, the future date or dates of transfer and related information in receipts that may be provided at the time payment is made or after the date of transfer. For any remittance transfer scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, the receipt provided when payment is made must disclose the date of transfer for that transfer. Where a consumer schedules a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the receipt provided for the first transfer must also provide the date of transfer for that first transfer. In each case, if a second receipt is required after the date of transfer, that receipt must also disclose the date the transfer was made. The final rule also addresses, among other things, a requirement to disclose future dates of transfer for subsequent preauthorized transfers. In addition to the information described above, the receipt provided for the initial transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers must also disclose the future date or dates of transfer for any subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer in that series for which the date of transfer is scheduled four or fewer business days after the date on which payment for the initial transfer is made. For other subsequent preauthorized transfers, the rule provides flexibility as to whether the information regarding transfer dates and cancellation requirements for subsequent transfers is included in one or more receipts or standalone disclosures, so long as it is provided sufficiently in advance to allow the consumer to exercise his or her cancellation rights.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Finally, as is the case with one-time transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, the final rule also requires that receipts for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers include the date of transfer for the transfer that is the subject of the receipt and, if the provider chooses, the future dates of transfer for the next scheduled subsequent transfer or transfers.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>31(a) General Form of Disclosures</title>
              <analysisSection>
        <title>31(a)(3)(iv)</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed below, the Bureau adds new § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii) to require that in certain circumstances, a receipt for a remittance transfer include the date of the transfer for that specific transfer in order to provide consumers with a clearer explanation of their cancellation rights. Further, the Bureau adds new § 1005.36(d) to require that in certain instances, such receipts disclose the dates of upcoming transfers and related information. The Bureau is making corresponding changes to the disclosure requirements for transfers conducted entirely by telephone to require oral disclosure of transfer date information in certain circumstances. As stated in the February Final Rule, the Bureau believes that for oral telephone transactions, senders should be informed of their cancellation rights before the cancellation period has passed. 77 FR 6194, 6217. Because a receipt would generally be mailed to a sender for telephone transactions as permitted by § 1005.31(e)(2), the sender may not receive the cancellation disclosure included in that receipt until after the standard 30-minute cancellation period had passed unless the Bureau required the disclosure to be made orally before the 30-minute cancellation period expires. Consequently, § 1005.31(a)(3)(iii), as adopted in the February Final Rule, requires oral disclosure of cancellation rights when the sender requests the remittance transfer and prior to payment for the transfer, if the provider takes advantage of the option to provide pre-payment disclosures orally for transactions conducted entirely by telephone.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For similar reasons, among others, the Bureau believes that for a remittance transfer scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, and for any preauthorized remittance transfer scheduled to occur four or fewer business days after the date payment is made for the transfer, an oral pre-payment disclosure regarding cancellation rights should be accompanied by an oral disclosure regarding the date of that transfer. Although the time period for cancellation of transfers scheduled in advance may be calculated in days rather than minutes, the period may still expire before the consumer receives any written material, particularly if the consumer is scheduling the transfer three or four days in advance. For preauthorized remittance transfers, several transfers in the series may be sent before a written receipt is received.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, pursuant to its authority under EFTA section 919(a)(5)(A), the Bureau is amending § 1005.31(a)(3) to add § 1005.31(a)(3)(iv) as a further condition for the provision of oral disclosures for remittance transfers conducted entirely by telephone. This provision permits oral disclosures if (among other requirements) the provider discloses orally, to the extent applicable, (A) the information required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii) and (B) the information required by § 1005.36(d)(1)(i)(A) with respect to transfers subject to § 1005.36(d)(2)(ii), pursuant to the timing requirements in § 1005.31(e)(1).</analysisParagraph>
              </analysisSection>
              <analysisSection>
        <title>31(a)(5)(iv)</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis to the February Final Rule, since remittance transfers sent via mobile application or text message on a telephone are conducted entirely by telephone, EFTA section 919(a)(5)(A) permits the Bureau to allow oral pre-payment disclosures in connection with transfers sent via mobile application or text message if the transfer is conducted entirely by telephone. 77 FR 6194, 6217. Because oral disclosures are not retainable, the Bureau further observed that for such transactions, senders would not be less protected, and might be better informed, by receiving pre-payment disclosures via mobile application or a text message even though these disclosures may also not be retainable. <em data-original="E-03">Id.</em> Accordingly, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and facilitate compliance, the Bureau used its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to include in the February Final Rule § 1005.31(a)(5), which states that the pre-payment disclosure may be provided orally or via mobile application or text message if: (i) The transaction is conducted entirely by telephone via mobile application or text message; (ii) the remittance transfer provider complies with the foreign language requirements of § 1005.31(g)(2); and (iii) the provider discloses orally or via mobile application or text message a statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) pursuant to the timing requirements in § 1005.31(e)(1).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to the same authority, and for the same reasons as those discussed above regarding with § 1005.31(a)(3)(iv), the Bureau adopts new § 1005.31(a)(5)(iv), which adds as an additional condition for the provision of the pre-payment disclosures orally or via mobile application or text message a requirement that the provider disclose, to the extent applicable, (A) the information required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii) and (B) the information required by § 1005.36(d)(1)(i)(A) with respect to transfers subject to § 1005.36(d)(2)(ii), pursuant to the timing requirements in § 1005.31(e)(1).</analysisParagraph>

        <title>31(b)(2)(vii) Date of Transfer</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The February Final Rule requires the receipt provided to a sender to include an abbreviated statement about the sender's cancellation rights. § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv). In the February Proposal, the Bureau noted that senders may have difficulty determining the specific date on which the right to cancel expires for a particular transfer. 77 FR 6310, 6321. Accordingly, the Bureau sought comment on whether, as applicable, the three-business-day deadline to cancel transfers should be disclosed differently to consumers, such as by requiring a remittance transfer provider to disclose in the receipt the specific date on which the right to cancel will expire or to state its business days in receipts provided to senders. The Bureau also solicited comment on alternative means of disclosing the deadline for cancelling transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received a number of comments on the cancellation disclosure from various industry members and one consumer group. Most comments focused on whether providers should be required to include the specific cancellation deadline in the receipts provided to senders. Commenters did not address any of the other questions raised on this issue in the February Proposal nor did they suggest alternatives.<footnote ref="11">Regarding the Bureau's inquiry about disclosure of the provider's business days, the Bureau did not receive comment on this issue specifically, although one industry commenter stated that providers should not be required to disclose the specific deadline to cancel or other additional items that are not required to be disclosed by the February Final Rule.</footnote></analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to disclosure of the specific cancellation date, the majority of industry commenters opposed such a requirement. Some industry commenters asserted that requiring disclosure of the specific cancellation deadline for a particular transaction would make it more difficult and expensive to produce receipts by adding a new element specific to each transfer. One industry commenter stated that requiring a remittance transfer provider to specify the exact date for cancellation would create significant technical challenges because at that point, the disclosure becomes dynamic, rather than static. This commenter stated that producing such a dynamic disclosure may require updating based on the time of day of the transfer request and the provider's processing deadline, whereas a static disclosure without such a requirement can be reliably produced at any time of day. Further, the commenter stated that a sender uncertain of the cancellation deadline will contact a remittance transfer provider directly for clarification and then cancel the transaction in the course of the same contact.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In contrast, the consumer group commenter argued that the period for cancellation rights should be disclosed as a specific date. One industry commenter did not oppose requiring remittance transfer providers to disclose the specific cancellation date for each transaction, but argued that providers should be allowed to disclose a cut-off time for exercising the cancellation right because the lack of clarity regarding the time of day the cancellation period expires could result in a transfer being delayed until the next business day.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to the Bureau's authority under EFTA section 919(d)(3), the February Final Rule is revised to add a new § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii), which requires that a receipt for any remittance transfer scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, or the first transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, disclose the date the remittance transfer provider will make or made the remittance transfer, using the term “Transfer Date,” or a substantially similar term.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adopting commentary to provide further guidance on the application of § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii). As explained in more detail below in the discussion of § 1005.36, for certain transactions, a receipt meeting the requirements of § 1005.31(b)(2), including the transfer date required under § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii), may need to be provided at different times. For example, for the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, an initial receipt will need to be provided at the time payment is made for the transfer; and then in some cases, a receipt will need to be provided shortly after that particular transfer has been made. Thus, comment 31(b)(2)-4 clarifies that, where applicable, § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii) requires disclosure of the date of transfer for the remittance transfer that is the subject of a receipt required by § 1005.31(b)(2), including a receipt that is provided in accordance with the timing requirements in § 1005.36(a).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(2)-4 further clarifies that, for any subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer subject to § 1005.36(d)(2)(ii), the future date of transfer and related information must be provided on any receipt provided for the initial transfer in that series of preauthorized remittance transfers, or where permitted, or disclosed as permitted by § 1005.31(a)(3) and (a)(5), in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(1)(i).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(2)-5 provides an example of how disclosure of the dates of transfer required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii) and § 1005.36(d)(1) should be provided in receipts required by § 1005.31(b)(2) pursuant to the timing requirements in § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(1)(ii). Comment 31(b)(2)-5 also explains that if the provider discloses on either receipt the cancellation period applicable to and dates of subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers in accordance with 1005.36(d)(2)(i), the disclosure must be phrased and formatted in such a way that it is clear to the sender which cancellation period is applicable each date of transfer on the receipt.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Upon further review and analysis, the Bureau concludes that because the cancellation requirements in § 1005.36(c) are based on and calculated from the date of transfer, the actual transfer date is the most logical piece of information to require since the remittance transfer provider is already required to obtain this information in order to comply with § 1005.36(c), although it is not required to be disclosed to the sender under the February Final Rule.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Further, the Bureau also believes that requiring a remittance transfer provider to disclose the date of a remittance transfer, along with a disclosure that the sender's cancellation rights will expire three business days before the date of the transfer, provides a reasonable balance between consumer and industry interests. This approach significantly improves the information provided to senders because, under the February Final Rule, a provider is generally only required to disclose the cancellation policy, with a statement such as “you can cancel for a full refund no later than three business days prior to the scheduled date of the transfer.” 77 FR 6310, 6321. This required disclosure, however, does not elaborate on what constitutes the date of transfer or how the sender may determine the cancellation deadline from the date of transfer. Without a clear starting point from which to count the three-business-day deadline, the Bureau believes senders may be confused about the dates by which they are required to cancel transfers, which may make cancellation disclosures less effective. In situations such as when transferred funds will be drawn from an account at a later date rather than paid up front, the transfer date may also help the sender understand when the funds for the transfer must be available for the provider to conduct the transfer. The transfer date may also help senders differentiate and keep track of completed transfers, especially where the sender receives a number of receipts in the mail or on an account statement in close proximity to one another.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also believes that requiring disclosure of the date of transfer is the most technically feasible solution relative to the alternatives raised in the February Proposal. The dates of transfer should be readily available to remittance transfer providers since they are likely primarily responsible for executing remittance transfer requests, and as part of their business processes should already know when they must execute transfers to satisfy the terms of their contracts with senders (if the contracts are based on the date of the transfer) or to meet any delivery deadlines (if those deadlines are the bases of the contracts). The Bureau also believes that disclosure of the date of transfer is an added benefit for senders who may choose to schedule a transaction based on when the funds must be available. Finally, the Bureau notes that the requirement to disclose the date of transfer is consistent with the existing requirement for certain preauthorized electronic fund transfers. In particular, § 1005.10(d)(1) (in subpart A of Regulation E) requires an electronic fund transfer provider to send the consumer the date of transfer (and other information) at least ten days before the scheduled date of the transfer when a preauthorized electronic fund transfer from the consumer's account will vary in amount from the previous transfer under the same authorization. Consequently, certain remittance transfer providers that also provide preauthorized electronic fund transfers may already have the capability to produce disclosures with the date of transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Moreover, the Bureau believes that keeping disclosure forms short, simple, and succinct is helpful to senders. As noted in the February Final Rule, participants in consumer testing understood and responded positively to concise, abbreviated disclosures. 77 FR 6194, 6228. Of the options considered, the Bureau believes that disclosure of only the date of transfer best accomplishes this goal because that date may be provided independently of other information. While disclosure of the specific dates of cancellation deadlines would inform senders of the actual dates on which their rights to cancel expire, the Bureau believes that consumers would still benefit from disclosure of the date of transfer. The Bureau is concerned that requiring providers to include multiple dates on receipts may be more confusing to senders and possibly dilute the usefulness of the disclosures regarding cancellation rights.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Likewise, the Bureau is concerned that requiring providers to state their business days on receipts may result in a longer, more unwieldy form. The Bureau believes that providers will generally make available to the public upon request the days that constitute “business days” under subpart B of Regulation E, and that, therefore, senders can obtain this information as necessary. Absent further data regarding the usefulness of this information, the Bureau does not believe that it is appropriate at this time to make the forms significantly longer and more complicated to include information that is likely to be used by only a small subset of consumers who may contact their remittance transfer providers in any event to effectuate the cancellation.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, the Bureau believes that requiring the date of transfer and cancellation rights in receipts strikes the appropriate balance between providing senders with information about their transfers and minimizing the burden to providers. However, the Bureau will continue to gather data on consumers' exercise of cancellation rights, the effectiveness of related disclosures, and programming burdens on providers over time and, if warranted, will reexamine this issue at a later date to determine if a better solution exists.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has further determined that it is appropriate to require disclosure of the date of transfer at the time payment is made, but also in subsequent receipts required to be provided with respect to a given transfer in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) or § 1005.36(a)(2)(ii). The Bureau believes that a single consistent rule will be simpler as a matter of programming for providers and will frequently provide additional benefits to consumers in light of the fact that the final rule eliminates the requirement to provide the pre-payment disclosure and receipt in advance of the transfer for subsequent preauthorized transfers in a series. (<em data-original="E-03">See</em> discussion below regarding § 1005.36(a).)</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In particular, although stating the date of transfer in a post-transfer receipt will not facilitate senders' understanding of cancellation deadlines that have already passed, the Bureau believes the information will frequently be useful to senders in other ways. For example, as noted above, if a sender schedules a number of standalone transfers before the date of transfer, or a series of closely-spaced preauthorized remittance transfers, senders may receive a number of receipts in close proximity to each other and may use the date of transfer to identify and track which transfer has occurred. Having the date of transfer on receipts with respect to each transfer would likewise be helpful in situations where the receipt is provided with a periodic statement on which there are several transactions.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, because senders may not receive additional disclosures prior to the subsequent preauthorized transfer in a series, the receipt provided after the transfer is completed in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(2)(ii) will contain information regarding cancellation rights (as well as the exchange rate, fees and taxes) that could help inform the sender about the upcoming subsequent remittance transfer. Furthermore, as most preauthorized remittance transfers are likely to be scheduled some time in advance, senders will generally receive receipts after the transfer is completed. This receipt would provide confirmation that the transfer occurred as scheduled. Finally, where remittance transfer providers choose to satisfy their obligations under § 1005.36(d)(1) by disclosing the future transfer dates for preauthorized transfers on a receipt relating to a prior transaction, providing the date of transfer for the prior transaction will help differentiate to which transfer the disclosures in the receipt apply.</analysisParagraph>

                  <title>Disclosure of Both the Three-Business-Day Deadline and the 30-Minute Deadline in Same Receipt</title>
                  <analysisParagraph>Under § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) of the February Final Rule, notice of the period to cancel a remittance transfer must be disclosed in the receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(2). For any transfer scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, the receipt provided by the remittance transfer provider to the sender may describe only the cancellation rights and three-business-day deadline set forth in § 1005.36(c). For all other remittance transfers, the provider is required to describe the cancellation rights and 30-minute cancellation period set forth in § 1005.34(a). In the February Proposal, the Bureau solicited comment on whether remittance transfer providers that offer both types of transfers should be given flexibility to include the two different cancellation periods permitted by this rule on the same receipt with some statement or method such as a checkbox to designate which cancellation period applies to a given transaction.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received only a few comments on this issue. Of those received, two industry commenters urged the Bureau to permit providers flexibility in disclosing the cancellation requirement. One industry commenter argued that allowing providers to include both cancellation period options on the same receipt would enable providers to rely on one standard receipt form, which, compared to the alternative, may result in lower costs for providers (and, presumably, lower prices for senders). The other industry commenter stated that it supported any disclosure modification that would allow smaller providers to generate and deliver one disclosure and that the proposed option would eliminate the need to produce multiple disclosures to reflect the different cancellation periods. A consumer group commenter, however, stated that, to ensure that senders receive accurate and precise information to avoid potential confusion, only the cancellation provision that corresponds to the type of remittance transfer requested should be disclosed.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>After consideration of these comments, the Bureau is adding new comment 31(b)(2)-6 to clarify that providers that offer remittance transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, as well as remittance transfers scheduled fewer than three business days before the date of the transfer, may meet the cancellation disclosure requirements in § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) by describing the three-business-day and 30-minute cancellation periods on the same disclosure and using a checkbox or other method to clearly designate the applicable cancellation period. In other words, remittance transfer providers that provide both transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer and transfers scheduled closer to the date of the transfer may disclose the cancellation period applicable to a particular transfer in one of two ways: (i) describe in the receipt either the 30-minute cancellation period or the three-business-day cancellation period, as applicable to the particular transaction; or (ii) provide a description of both the 30-minute and three-business-day cancellation periods along with a clear indication of which cancellation period applies to the sender's transaction. With respect to the latter option, the comment does not mandate a particular method for identifying the applicable time period for cancellation. The comment, however, clarifies that the provider may use a number of ways to indicate which cancellation period applies to the transaction including, but not limited to, a statement to that effect, use of a checkbox, highlighting, circling, and the like. Finally, comment 31(b)(2)-6 states that for transfers scheduled three or more business days before the date of transfer, the cancellation disclosures provided pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) should be phrased and formatted in such a way that it is clear to the sender which cancellation period is applicable to the date of transfer disclosed on the receipt.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes senders are unlikely to be confused by having a description of both cancellation deadlines in the same disclosure. To the contrary, including a description of both the 30-minute and three-business-day cancellation period with a checkbox or other method that clearly designates the cancellation time period applicable to the sender's transaction may improve senders' understanding of the cancellation provisions generally. Moreover, the ability for remittance transfer providers to use pre-printed receipt forms that describe both cancellation options with some method to identify the applicable cancellation time period may reduce the need to create multiple standard receipts, potentially reducing costs for some providers. The Bureau also notes that nothing in the final rule prohibits a provider from including only the applicable cancellation policy on a receipt.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>31(b)(3) Combined Disclosure</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is revising the requirements in the February Final Rule for combined disclosures that remittance transfer providers may choose to give to senders. Under § 1005.31(b)(3) in the February Final Rule, a remittance transfer provider may combine the pre-payment disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(1) and the receipt required by § 1005.31(b)(2) into a single, combined disclosure, if such a disclosure is provided pursuant to the timing requirements applicable to pre-payment disclosures. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(e)(1). Section 1005.31(b)(3) provides that if the provider chooses to provide a combined disclosure, the provider must also provide the sender a proof of payment for the transfer when payment is made for the remittance transfer. As described in the February Final Rule, the Bureau issued § 1005.31(b)(3) pursuant to its authority under EFTA sections 919(a)(5)(C), and 904(a) and (c).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to the same authority, the Bureau is revising § 1005.31(b)(3) to allow a remittance transfer provider to provide a confirmation of scheduling in lieu of the proof of payment with combined disclosures for transfers scheduled before the date of transfer in order to facilitate compliance and enhance consumer protection. The Bureau is redesignating § 1005.31(b)(3) from the February Final Rule as § 1005.31(b)(3)(i) and is adopting a new § 1005.31(b)(3)(ii). Section 1005.31(b)(3)(ii) states that if the disclosure described in § 1005.31(b)(3)(i) is provided in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) (which concerns one-time transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer or the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers) and payment is not processed by the remittance transfer provider at the time the remittance transfer is scheduled, a remittance transfer provider may provide confirmation that the transaction has been scheduled in lieu of the proof of payment otherwise required by § 1005.31(b)(3)(i). The confirmation of scheduling must be clear and conspicuous, provided in writing or electronically, and provided in a retainable form.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Although the February Proposal did not propose changes to § 1005.31(b)(3), it sought comment generally on the form of disclosures for transfers scheduled before the date of transfer. 77 FR 6310, 6317. The Bureau believes that adjustments are necessary to § 1005.31(b)(3) because while comment 31(e)-2 in the final rule states that payment is made for purposes of subpart B of Regulation E when payment is authorized, this does not necessarily mean that providing “proof of payment” at the time of authorization will make sense for either the provider or the sender for a one-time remittance transfer that is scheduled before the date of transfer or the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers when payment may not be processed until closer to the date of such transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For many remittance transfers, senders tender payment for immediate processing once they authorize the remittance transfer provider to complete the transfer (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> by paying cash or by providing a payment device). In those situations, the Bureau does not believe there would be any downside for the sender or the remittance transfer provider if the provider provided proof of payment at the time that payment is made, <em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> authorized. These situations are distinct from the case in which a sender arranges with the provider to have funds deducted from the sender's account with the provider or to process a payment with a payment device at some later time, closer to the date of a transfer. In such an instance, the Bureau is concerned that providing a sender with “proof of payment” could confuse the sender. Furthermore, the Bureau is concerned that providers may not wish to provide “proof of payment” in such instances.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 31(b)(3)-2 provides additional guidance regarding the confirmation of scheduling. This comment explains that, as discussed in comment 31(e)-2, payment is considered to be made when payment is authorized for purposes of various timing requirements in subpart B, including with regard to the timing requirement for provision of the proof of payment described in § 1005.31(b)(3)(i). However, where a transfer (whether a one-time remittance transfer or the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers) is scheduled before the date of transfer and the provider does not intend to process payment until at or near the date of transfer, the provider may provide a confirmation of scheduling in lieu of the proof of payment required by § 1005.31(b)(3)(i). No further proof of payment is required when payment is later processed.</analysisParagraph>

                    <title>33(a)(1)(iv)(D)</title>
                    <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) of the 2012 Final Rule defines as an error a remittance transfer provider's failure to make funds available to the designated recipient by the date of availability stated on the receipt or combined disclosure, subject to three listed exceptions, including an exception for remittance transfers made with fraudulent intent by the sender or a person working in concert with the sender. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C).  Comment 33(a)-5 to the 2012 Final Rule elaborates on the definition of the term “error” under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) and explains that such errors under subpart B of Regulation E include, among other things, the late delivery of funds, the total non-delivery of a remittance transfer, and the delivery of funds to the wrong account. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comments 33(a)-5.1 and .ii.  The commentary further notes that if only a portion of the funds are made available by the disclosed date of availability, then § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) does not apply, but § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) may apply instead.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>As explained under comment 33(c)-2 in the 2012 Final Rule, an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) would include situations where a remittance transfer provider failed to make funds in connection with a remittance transfer available to a designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability because the sender provided an incorrect account number to the remittance transfer provider.  After issuance of the 2012 Final Rule, the Bureau received comments from industry that providers often have no means to verify designated recipients' account numbers for remittance transfers into foreign bank accounts.  As a result, providers could have to bear the potentially significant costs of their customers' mistakes in cases in which funds were deposited in the wrong account and could not be recovered as a result of the sender's provision of an incorrect account number.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>In the December Proposal, the Bureau proposed to revise the definition of error in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) by adding a fourth, conditional exception.  Proposed § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) would have excluded from the definition of error a failure to make funds available to the designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability, where such failure resulted from the sender having given the remittance transfer provider an incorrect account number, provided that the provider met the conditions set forth in proposed § 1005.33(h).  These proposed conditions, would have required providers to notify senders of the risk that their funds could be lost, to investigate reported errors, and to attempt to recover the missing funds.  In addition, the exception would have been limited to situations in which the funds were actually deposited into the wrong account.  Where these conditions were met, the proposed exception would not have required providers to bear the cost of refunding or resending transfers.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>The Bureau sought comment on the proposed exception generally and whether it should be limited to mistakes regarding account numbers or expanded to include other incorrect information provided by senders in connection with remittance transfers, such as routing numbers.  Each of these is discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisSection>
                      <title>Exception for Senders' Mistakes Regarding Account Numbers</title>
                      <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters uniformly supported the addition of the proposed exception to the definition of error where the error was caused by the sender's provision of an incorrect account number.  They put forth a number of reasons why they favored the proposed change.  In many respects, these comments expanded upon those received prior to the December Proposal.</analysisParagraph>
                      <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters reiterated earlier concerns about the large potential exposure given their general inability of remittance transfer providers to validate the accuracy of a designated recipient's account number provided in connection with a wire transfers and similar types of open network transfers sent to accounts at banks and other institutions abroad.  These commenters argued that providers sending these transfers over open networks generally have limited ability to cross-check account numbers with the names of accountholders prior to sending transfers because they often have no direct relationships with recipient institutions and thus no means of accessing those institutions' account information.  Commenters further stated that as a result, the only way for a provider to validate such numbers may be to contact the recipient institution manually, which may be time-consuming and difficult due to language and time zone issues.  Such validation would necessitate manual handling of remittance transfers and limit the ability of providers to use automated systems, which are less costly than manual handling of each transfer.  Commenters stated their concern that manual validation could substantially increase costs to senders and delay the processing of remittance transfers.  Relatedly, several commenters claimed that it was infeasible to expect providers to develop account number verification systems, automated or otherwise, before the effective date of the 2012 Final Rule (which was scheduled to take effect on February 7, 2013) due to the number of institutions worldwide that would need to adjust their systems used for transmitting wires.</analysisParagraph>
                      <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters also reiterated concerns expressed prior to the issuance of the December Proposal regarding the potential for fraud if a sender's provision of an incorrect account number is considered an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv).  As discussed in the December Proposal, commenters had stated that the 2012 Final Rule could enable fraudulent activity to flourish because, if unscrupulous senders provided incorrect account numbers and funds were sent to a coconspirator, remittance transfer providers might have to send transfer amounts again to another coconspirator without first recovering them.  Commenters argued that the fraud exception in the 2012 Final Rule—§ 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C)—is insufficient because for providers to use the exception would be difficult in most circumstances.  Many industry commenters stated that providers in the United States typically have a limited ability to gather evidence of fraud from a recipient institution abroad or to mandate cooperation from foreign institutions with whom they have no direct relationship.  Industry commenters also noted that even if a provider suspected fraud, the lack of evidence would cause providers to hesitate to accuse one of its own customers of fraud.  Industry commenters also stated that the 2012 Final Rule departed from current industry practice by requiring that remittance transfer providers resend or refund a remittance transfer even when a sender's mistake results in mis-delivery of funds that cannot be recovered.</analysisParagraph>
                      <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters expressed concern that in light of the significant exposure under the 2012 Final Rule's sender error provisions, if the Bureau did not revise the error resolution procedures as it proposed to do in the December Proposal, many remittance transfer providers would curtail their remittance transfer offerings such as by limiting the amount permitted per transfer, limiting transfers to certain trusted customers, or by exiting the remittance transfer business altogether.</analysisParagraph>
                      <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters also argued that the Bureau should not have adopted the approach taken in the 2012 Final Rule to sender error because it was not mandated by statute.  One of these commenters opined that because the Dodd-Frank Act was not specific with respect to who must bear the cost of a mis-directed remittance transfer, the Bureau's legal authority to require remittance transfer providers to bear the cost of mistakes made by senders was questionable.</analysisParagraph>
                      <analysisParagraph>In contrast to comments from industry, consumer group commenters were divided on whether the Bureau should adopt the proposed exception for certain sender errors.  Two consumer groups supported the proposed change because, they contended, the proposed rule achieved the appropriate allocation of risk between senders and remittance transfer providers and incentivized providers to minimize the occurrence of errors.  These commenters also stated that it would be difficult for providers, particularly small providers, to retrieve funds sent to the wrong account.  They further asserted that it would be difficult for providers, and particularly credit unions, to accuse their customers or members of fraud in order to avail themselves of the fraud exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C).  As a result, these consumer group commenters argued that absent the proposed revision, many providers might choose to exit the remittance transfer business altogether, resulting in a loss of access to senders.</analysisParagraph>
                      <analysisParagraph>Other consumer groups opposed the proposed changes and urged the Bureau not to amend the 2012 Final Rule with respect to sender mistakes regarding account numbers that result in the loss of the transfer amount.  First, some of these groups argued that the Bureau would be undermining the intent of Congress, which, they argued, was to motivate industry to change existing practices to develop more secure means of sending remittance transfers.  By adopting the proposed exception, these commenters argued, the Bureau would eliminate any incentive for remittance transfer providers to develop enhanced security procedures.  Relatedly, some consumer groups also argued that the existing definition of error in subpart A of Regulation E, specifically § 1005.11(a)(ii), already addresses the situation in which a consumer provides an incorrect recipient account number by creating an error for “incorrect” electronic fund transfers.<footnote ref="8">Section 1005.11 of subpart A of Regulation E contains error resolution provisions for electronic fund transfers.  Section 1005.11(a)(ii) states that a potential error under the rule is an “incorrect electronic fund transfer to or from the consumer's account.”</footnote>
                        These commenters noted that insofar as § 1005.11(a)(ii) is phrased in general terms and refers to an “incorrect electronic fund transfer” by its plain language it does not exclude incorrect information provided by a consumer (or any other party).  Insofar as § 1005.11(a)(ii) has long applied to a portion of remittance transfers, the commenters contended that had Congress intended to deny the protections of this provision to consumers, it would have done so more explicitly.</analysisParagraph>
                      <analysisParagraph>Finally, some consumer group commenters suggested that the Bureau should not adopt the proposed exception to the definition of error, even if the 2012 Final Rule would result in some remittance transfer providers exiting the market because they are unable to implement adequate verification procedures today.  Alternatively, these commenters suggested that, in order to reduce the risk of market exit, that the Bureau could adopt the proposed revisions, but limit the proposed exception to the definition of error to transfers over a certain dollar amount so that senders of smaller transfers would still benefit from the error provisions in the 2012 Final Rule.</analysisParagraph>
                      <analysisParagraph>Upon consideration of these comments and further consideration and to facilitate compliance, the Bureau is finalizing § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) with several changes from the proposed provision, which are discussed below.  As in the December Proposal, the exception as finalized will only apply if a remittance transfer provider can meet certain conditions including warnings to senders and use of reasonable validation methods where available.  These conditions are set forth in § 1005.33(h) and also are discussed in detail below.  Where the exception applies, providers will not be required to bear the cost of refunding or resending transfers if funds ultimately cannot be recovered.</analysisParagraph>
                      <analysisParagraph>As it noted in the December Proposal, the Bureau believes that this exception appropriately allocates risk based on remittance transfer providers' existing methods for sending transfers, which often do not allow for or facilitate verification of designated recipients' account numbers.  The Bureau continues to believe it is important for industry to develop improved security procedures and expects to engage in a dialogue with industry about how to encourage the growth of improved controls and communication mechanisms.  But the Bureau understands that industry is unlikely to be reasonably able to implement such changes in the near future.  Subpart B of Regulation E does not regulate most recipient institutions, and the Bureau has concluded that individual providers, and particularly those sending transfers through open networks have limited ability to influence the practices of financial institutions worldwide in the short term.</analysisParagraph>
                      <analysisParagraph>Absent such changes, the Bureau is concerned that remittance transfer providers will exit the market or reduce remittance offerings rather than risk having to bear the cost of the entire transfer amount where funds are deposited into the wrong  account due to the sender's provision of an incorrect account number.  The Bureau believes such an interim disruption would not be in consumers' best interests, and thus has finalized the proposed exception as discussed below.  The Bureau, however, will continue to evaluate the development of procedures as it monitors providers' implementation of and compliance with the 2013 Final Rule.</analysisParagraph>
                      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau disagrees with those consumer group commenters that the 2012 Final Rule should be allowed to take effect absent the proposed exception for sender account number mistakes, and that the Bureau should instead monitor whether the concerns summarized in the December Proposal—such as increased fraud and remittance transfer providers exiting the market—actually materialize.  As stated above and in the December Proposal, the Bureau is concerned that absent the proposed change, some providers would severely curtail their offerings or withdraw from the remittance transfer business altogether, and such a market change could have a negative impact on senders.  The Bureau also does not believe, as commenters suggested, that it is appropriate to limit the scope of the exception to larger value transfers, because doing so could potentially encourage providers to limit senders' access to smaller value transfers.  In addition, the Bureau does not believe it appropriate to engage in line drawing or to provide differential protections in this circumstance.  Furthermore, the Bureau disagrees that the proposed exception would harm senders in that the exception in many ways maintains the status quo insofar as the Bureau believes that, today, senders typically bear the loss when their mistake leads to a mis-deposit.  Nor does the Bureau believe that the problem of senders losing the transfer amount is particularly widespread today; insofar as the status quo is maintained, the Bureau does not expect this to change.  The Bureau's outreach confirmed that in most cases where there is a problem in the transmission of a remittance transfer, the provider is able to retrieve the funds or have them routed properly.</analysisParagraph>
                      <analysisParagraph>With regard to commenters' arguments about the Bureau's statutory authority, the Bureau disagrees both with industry participant and consumer group arguments that the EFTA or section 1073 of the Dodd-Frank Act specifies which party must bear the cost of a sender's mistake with respect to remittance transfer.  Rather, EFTA section 919 gives the Bureau broad discretion to set standards for remittance transfer providers with respect to error resolution, including to define errors, and does not mandate a specific result with regard to which party should bear the risk of loss under any particular circumstances.  Nor does the Bureau believe that the definition of error in subpart A of Regulation E, which does not apply to all remittance transfers, precludes the Bureau from adopting more specifically tailored error resolutions, and corresponding definitions, applicable to all remittance transfers under subpart B of Regulation E. <em data-original="E-03">See also</em> § 1005.33(f).  Accordingly, the Bureau has adopted the proposed exception for sender account number mistakes subject to specific conditions discussed below.</analysisParagraph>

                      <title>The Scope of the Sender Error Exception</title>
                      <analysisParagraph>As noted above the Bureau also sought comment on the scope of the proposed exception to the definition of error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) and whether it should apply to incorrect information provided by senders in addition to designated recipients' account numbers and, in particular, whether the proposed exception should apply in cases in which senders make mistakes regarding routing numbers or similar institution identifiers in addition to mistakes regarding account numbers.</analysisParagraph>
                      <analysisParagraph>In response, many industry commenters suggested that the proposed exception be expanded to refer to sender mistakes regarding any information provided by a sender in connection with a remittance transfer rather than just mistaken account numbers, as proposed.  Other commenters listed specific types of incorrect information that should be addressed by the exception to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv), such as:  Routing numbers, Business Identifier Codes (BICs), Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication codes (SWIFT codes), International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs), local bank codes, prepaid, debit or credit card account numbers, recipient institutions' names, designated recipients' names, escrow account numbers, currencies in which transfers will be received, incomplete wire instructions, and recipients' email addresses, phone numbers, and addresses.  Commenters offered different reasons as to why the proposed exception should be expanded to include sender mistakes regarding each suggested type of information.  In addition to considering these comments, the Bureau conducted additional outreach to understand the nature of errors related to the suggested types of information and why remittance transfer providers thought they should be included in any exception to an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) in the 2012 Final Rule.</analysisParagraph>
                      <analysisParagraph>Many of the industry commenters that urged that the proposed exception should be extended to all mistakes made by senders argued, as noted above, that there is no statutory basis to make remittance transfer providers bear the cost of all senders' mistakes.  Relatedly, one commenter argued that no other consumer finance statute protects consumers from their own errors and that there is a distinction between allocating risk to a provider for mistakes by third parties, or where fault cannot be determined, and requiring providers to bear the cost of senders' mistakes.</analysisParagraph>
                      <analysisParagraph>As for the specific types of information provided by senders, nearly all industry commenters and some consumer group commenters favored expanding the proposed exception to apply to sender mistakes regarding routing numbers and other recipient institution identifiers.  Commenters explained that for many remittance transfers into accounts, remittance transfer providers request, in addition to the number of the designated recipient's account, an alphanumeric identifier of the recipient institution, similar to the routing numbers used to identify depository institutions in the United States.<footnote ref="9">For example, in order to route a wire transfer to a foreign bank, a bank in the United States may require that the sender provide the name of the designated recipient and the recipient's institution as well as the BIC for the recipient's institution, and the recipient's account number.</footnote>
                        Providers, and any other intermediaries involved in the transfer, then use this identifier to determine the institution to which the transfer should be sent.  Commenters further explained that, in many cases, a sender's mistake regarding the identifier of a bank could pose a similar problem for a provider as an incorrect account number.  The commenters stated that, like account numbers, many providers lack the ability to verify the accuracy of alphanumerical identifiers related to recipient institutions that are provided by senders.  If a recipient institution identifier is incorrect and the provider does not match it with an institution name, funds could conceivably be mis-deposited if the institution represented by the incorrect routing number has an account matching the number provided by the sender.</analysisParagraph>
                      <analysisParagraph>In addition to sender  mistakes regarding account numbers and recipient institution identifiers, several commenters asked that the Bureau exclude from the definition of error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) senders' mistakes regarding correspondent routing instructions (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> if the sender suggests that the remittance transfer provider send the transfer through a particular correspondent that is unable to complete the transfer).  Several commenters stated that generally this sort of mistake generally would lead to a delay of a transfer and not its mis-deposit into the wrong account.</analysisParagraph>
                      <analysisParagraph>Finally, several industry commenters argued that the proposed exception should be expanded to apply to senders' mistakes regarding designated recipients' names and information that the designated recipient themselves might need to apply the proceeds of remittance transfers after receipt.  For example, a trade association commenter asked that the Bureau expand the proposed exception to include sender mistakes about additional information a designated recipient needs to process a transfer it receives.  The commenter stated that if, for example, the designated recipient is an insurer, it might need the designated recipient's policy number to process the funds received.  Similarly, one commenter stated that if a designated recipient is a property lessor, the lessor might need an identifying apartment number in order to process a transfer that is a rent payment.</analysisParagraph>
                      <analysisParagraph>After careful consideration of the comments received and upon further consideration, the Bureau is expanding the exception to the definition of error in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to include situations where a sender has provided an incorrect recipient institution identifier in addition to situations where a sender provides an incorrect account number, as long as the error results in a mis-deposit of the funds and that the remittance transfer provider meets the conditions set forth in § 1005.33(h).  As discussed below, the 2013 Final Rule includes as one such condition, that the provider use reasonably available means to verify the recipient institution identifier provided by the sender. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(h)(2).</analysisParagraph>
                      <analysisParagraph>Based on its monitoring of the remittance market, review of comment letters, and other outreach, the Bureau believes that situations in which an incorrect recipient institution identifier could result in a transfer being deposited into the wrong account are exceedingly rare but not unheard of.  More typically, the Bureau understands, a mistaken identifier will result in a transfer that is returned to the remittance transfer provider because either the identifier does not match any institution or the account number does not match an account at the institution to which the transfer is mistakenly directed.  Nevertheless, the Bureau is expanding the exception in the 2013 Final Rule beyond what was proposed because, upon further consideration, it believes that it is appropriate to treat mistakes in recipient institution identifiers similarly to mistakes in account numbers.  The two types of identifiers are similar in purpose and, in some cases, are combined into one.  In addition, these identifiers may not be easily verifiable by providers sending remittance transfers over an open network and are used in straight-through, automated processing of transfers.  Additionally, although less likely than as with respect to account numbers, under the 2012 Final Rule an unscrupulous sender could potentially provide an incorrect routing number to perpetrate a fraud with a coconspirator abroad.</analysisParagraph>
                      <analysisParagraph>Contrary to requests by commenters that the Bureau extend the proposed exception for sender mistakes regarding account numbers to mistakes regarding all types of information, the Bureau is limiting the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to sender mistakes regarding account numbers and recipient institution identifiers because it does not believe it is appropriate to extend the exception to all mistakes a sender might make in connection with a remittance transfer for several reasons.  While the chance of mis-deposit is limited for all sender mistakes, the Bureau believes there is a greater risk for mistakes regarding account numbers and recipient institution identifiers.  However, for most other types of sender mistakes identified by commenters, such as mistakes regarding the recipient's address or wire instructions, the Bureau does not believe that the incorrect information would usually result in a mis-deposit of a remittance transfer.  Instead, the Bureau believes that these mistakes will at most result in a delay of delivery or in non-delivery of the remittance transfer.  In situations where the recipient institution identifies a customer with the same name as the designated recipient but is unable to match that customer's name to the provided account number, the Bureau believes that the recipient institution will generally be unable to apply the funds and that the transfer will be returned or otherwise delayed but that the funds will not be mis-deposited.</analysisParagraph>
                      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe that it is warranted to extend the exception to those sender mistakes that are likely to result only in either a delay or a return of the transfer to the remittance transfer provider, and not the loss of funds, because the cost to the provider of delay or non-delivery differs markedly from the cost of lost transfers.  Under the 2012 Final Rule, when a transfer is delayed or returned to the provider, the provider must refund its fee to the sender. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii).  Additionally, when the transfer is returned to the provider, the sender can request that the transfer be resent at no charge (although third-party fees may be imposed on the resend) or have the transfer amount refunded. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii).  The cost to the provider in these circumstances differs markedly from the cost to the provider under the 2012 Final Rule for a transfer that is mis-deposited into the wrong account and cannot be retrieved.  When a mis-deposit occurs, absent an exception, the provider may have to resend or refund the entire transfer amount if the transfer could not be retrieved from the wrong account rather than merely refund its fee or send a transfer at no cost. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii) and comment 33(c)-2 in the 2012 Final Rule.  Thus, for mis-deposited transfers, the fact that the provider is potentially at risk of having to absorb a loss of principal is far higher than for other types of errors and thus is far more likely to lead to a significant curtailment of services.  Furthermore, the Bureau believes that, in many respects, the remedy under the 2012 Final Rule for non-delivery is similar to many providers' existing practices in that they now resend funds at no charge with the corrected information.  Therefore, to maintain as an error sender mistakes that merely result in delay or non-delivery of the remittance transfer as part of this final rule would not require a significant adjustment for those providers.  Finally, the 2012 Final Rule already allows providers a mechanism to manage uncertainty regarding the date of delivery of funds. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) and comment 32(b)(2)-1 (interpreting § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) to allow a provider to disclose the “latest date on which funds will be available”).</analysisParagraph>
                      <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters suggested that the Bureau should make senders, rather than providers, bear the costs of their own mistakes because no other consumer protection regimes makes the regulated entities bear the costs of consumers' mistakes.  The Bureau does not think it is necessary or appropriate that the remittances rules' remedy provisions match perfectly those in other consumer protection regimes, given the unique statutory structure and nature of the transactions at issue.  The Bureau is maintaining the 2012 Final Rule's error provisions regarding sender mistakes other than those covered by the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D), because it believes providers are generally in the best position to institute systems to limit their occurrence and to work with other industry participants to resolve particular mistakes in transmissions.</analysisParagraph>
                      <analysisParagraph>With respect to those mistakes that are likely to result only in a delay or non-delivery of a remittance transfer (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> mistakes other than those regarding account number or the recipient institution identifier), the Bureau believes that retaining the current rule, which does not include an exception for such mistakes, strikes the appropriate balance been protecting senders and encouraging providers to limit the incidence of such errors without exposing providers to the risk of loss of the transfer amount.  With respect to those sender mistakes that make it impossible for the recipient (as opposed to the recipient institution) to know how to use the funds received (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> an apartment number to apply a rent payment), the Bureau does not believe that such mistakes would give rise to an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv).  This is true because the 2013 Final Rule only does not define as an error the inability of the designated recipient to timely apply the funds for a particular purpose once a transfer is received.</analysisParagraph>
                      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also does not believe that a sender's provision of an incorrect name would result in an error under the 2013 Final Rule, and thus a sender's provision of an incorrect name need not be included in the exception from the term error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D).  As defined under § 1005.30(c), a designated recipient is “any person specified by the sender as the authorized recipient of a remittance transfer to be received at a foreign country.”  As noted above, comment 30(c)-1 in the 2012 Final Rule stated that a designated recipient can be either a natural person or an organization, such as a corporation.  The Bureau is further clarifying this comment in the 2013 Final Rule to explain that the designated recipient is identified by the name of the person provided by the sender to the remittance transfer provider and disclosed by the provider to the sender pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(iii). <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 30(c)-1.  Thus, assume for example that a sender tells a remittance transfer provider to send a transfer to “Jane Doe” at a foreign bank, the provider discloses “Jane Doe” pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(2)(iii), and the transfer is timely deposited by that bank into Jane Doe's account.  If the sender later asserts that an error occurred because the sender in fact intended the transfer to be sent to “John Doe” but had not communicated that to the provider, no error has occurred under the final rule because “Jane Doe” was the name of the designated recipient stated on the receipt provided to the sender.</analysisParagraph>
                      <analysisParagraph>In some cases, however, a sender's name can result in an error.  If, for example, the recipient institution could not deliver the remittance transfer described above because no one named “Jane Doe” had an account at the recipient institution, or more than one person named “Jane Doe” had an account at that institution such that the funds could not be applied, the transfer would be delayed or rejected resulting in an error because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information.  Insofar as this would not lead to the deposit of the transfer in the wrong account, the Bureau is not inclined to include these mistakes in the exception.</analysisParagraph>
                      <analysisParagraph>Commenters also urged the Bureau to include in the exception to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) to mistakes regarding mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and debit, credit and prepaid card numbers, arguing that these additional categories of identifiers warrant the same treatment as those covered by proposed § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D).  Commenters supporting expansion of the exception to include these identifiers generally put forth the same reasons as those discussed above regarding account numbers and recipient institution identifiers.  These commenters generally did not address the practical differences between transfers sent between bank accounts and those sent to other types of accounts.</analysisParagraph>
                      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not think it appropriate to extend the exception to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to these sorts of identifiers for several reasons.  First, § 1005.31(b)(2)(iii) requires that a remittance transfer provider disclose the name of the designated recipient to the sender and comment 30(c)-1 now clarifies that the designated recipient is identified by the name of the person stated on the disclosure provided pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(iii) regardless of what other identifying information that the sender may also have provided to the provider.  Insofar as a provider must disclose the name of the designated recipient on the receipt provided to the sender, the provider is not permitted to process a remittance transfer under the 2013 Final Rule by only disclosing a non-name identifier, such as a card number, email address, or mobile number.  To the extent providers currently send transfers without disclosing a name to the sender, they will not be able to continue doing so once the 2013 Final Rule takes effect.</analysisParagraph>
                      <analysisParagraph>Second, the Bureau believes that in the current market, only a small number of providers send remittance transfers to designated recipients who are identified by mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and debit, credit and prepaid card numbers.  These providers are often conducting transfers between two of their own customers through a closed network, and thus are in position to verify designated recipients' identities.  In other words, for transfers conducted through these closed-networks, both the sender and recipient will have agreed to sign on to the provider's network in order to send or receive funds.  The Bureau understands that, today, a number of the providers using these identifiers may not verify that the identifier matches the name of the designated recipient in every instance.  However, the Bureau believes that unlike providers using account numbers to identify designated recipients in transfers through the open network system, these providers have a reasonable ability to implement security measures in order to limit the possibility that senders make mistakes regarding designated recipients' mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and debit, credit and prepaid card numbers.  These measures might include confirmation codes, test transactions, or other methods to prevent transfers from being sent to the wrong person.</analysisParagraph>
                      <analysisParagraph>Third, the Bureau believes that the systems are still limited and nascent for transfers in which the mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and debit, credit and prepaid card numbers are used to identify designated recipients and the transfer is not sent entirely over the remittance transfer provider's own network.  As these systems grow, the Bureau expects that providers can proactively design systems in such a way as to allow for the development of better verification protocols.  If, in the future, providers intend to develop new systems to allow transfers using only names and mobile phone numbers to identify designated recipients, for example, the Bureau believes that such systems should be designed to verify that the provided names and numbers match before recipients can receive transfers.  The Bureau does not believe that such methods can be implemented for most transfers sent to bank accounts.  As described above, such transfers are generally sent as wire transfers, through an open network system.</analysisParagraph>
                      <analysisParagraph>As noted, the Bureau has limited the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to account numbers and recipient institution identifiers in order to encourage the growth of improved controls and communication mechanisms that may generally limit the possibility of other errors in the transmission of remittance transfers.  Furthermore, the Bureau intends to monitor closely industry's ability to verify account numbers and recipient institution identifiers and will consider modifying this exception if it thinks such verification methods become reasonably available and are able to prevent most errors from occurring.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>33(a) Definition of Error</title>
              <analysisSection>
                <title>Definition of Error Generally</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(a)(1) defined the term “error” for purposes of the remittance transfer error resolution provisions. Proposed § 205.33(a)(2) listed types of transfers or inquiries that do not constitute errors. The proposed commentary provided additional guidance illustrating errors under the rule.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters generally believed the proposed error definitions were overly broad because they would subject a remittance transfer provider to liability for errors caused by parties outside the control of the provider. Some of these commenters suggested that requiring providers to assume responsibility for errors when the provider has not erred nor controlled the circumstances that caused the error would undermine the safety and soundness of these transfer systems and could lead some financial institutions to eliminate remittance transfer services. Other industry commenters predicted that the financial impact of losses experienced as a result of errors caused by another party could be significant enough for providers to exit the market.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is amending certain error definitions in response to these comments, as discussed below. In general, under a number of financial consumer protection laws, the regulated entity has the responsibility to investigate errors asserted by consumers and generally assumes much of the liability when an error has occurred even where neither the regulated entity nor the consumer are at fault. <em data-original="E-03">See, e.g.,</em> 15 U.S.C. 1693f and 1693g; 15 U.S.C. 1643; 12 CFR 1005.11; and 12 CFR 1026.13. Thus, consistent with other error resolution procedures in Federal financial consumer protection laws, the Bureau believes that where neither a sender nor a remittance transfer provider are necessarily at fault, a provider generally is in a better position than a sender to identify, and possibly recover from, the party at fault.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, placing liability with the remittance transfer provider in these instances aligns the remittance transfer provider's incentives with those of the sender. Remittance transfer providers are likely better able to work with parties in the remittance transfer system or government entities to reduce errors to remittance transfers overall. Placing responsibility on providers increases the incentives of providers to develop such policies, procedures, and controls. As a result, the Bureau does not believe that whether a particular circumstance constitutes an error should necessarily depend on whether a provider is at fault. The Bureau further notes that this is similar to the approach taken in defining “errors” under § 1005.11 for EFTs where something may be considered an “error” even if the financial institution did not cause the error.</analysisParagraph>

                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(i) defined “error” to include an incorrect amount paid by a sender in connection with a remittance transfer. This element of the definition is similar to the error described in § 1005.11(a)(1)(ii) of an incorrect EFT to or from a consumer's account. The Board also proposed comment 33(a)-1 to clarify that proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(i) was intended to cover circumstances in which the amount paid by the sender differs from the total amount of the transaction stated in the receipt or the combined disclosure. Proposed comment 33(a)-1 also stated that an error under § 205.33(a)(1)(i) covered incorrect amounts paid by a sender regardless of the form or method of payment tendered by the sender for the transfer, including when a debit, credit, or prepaid card is used to pay an amount in excess of the amount of the transfer requested by the sender plus applicable fees.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Commenters did not specifically address proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(i) or proposed comment 33(a)-1.

                <title>33(a)(1)(ii) Computational or Bookkeeping Error</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(ii), an “error” also included “a computational or bookkeeping error made by a remittance transfer provider relating to a remittance transfer.” This provision is similar to an existing computational or bookkeeping error provision for EFTs in § 1005.11(a)(iv). In implementing this provision of Regulation E, the Board noted that § 1005.11(a)(iv) (formerly § 205.11(a)(iv)) is intended to include “arithmetical errors, posting errors, errors in printing figures, and figures that were jumbled due to mechanical or electronic malfunction.” <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 44 FR 59480 (Oct. 15, 1979). Proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(ii) was meant to cover similar types of errors with respect to remittance transfers, such as circumstances in which a remittance transfer provider fails to reflect all fees that will be imposed in connection with the transfer or misapplies the applicable exchange rate in calculating the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient. As noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, notwithstanding that the designated recipient may receive the amount of currency stated on the receipt or combined disclosure, an error could be asserted because the provider incorrectly calculated the amount that should have been received. The Bureau did not receive any comments on proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(ii). The Bureau adopts this provision as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(a)(1)(ii).</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisSection>
                <title>33(a)(1)(iii) Incorrect Amount Received by the Designated Recipient</title>
                <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iii) to provide that an “error” generally included the failure by a remittance transfer provider to make available to a designated recipient the amount of currency identified in the receipt or combined disclosure given to the sender, unless the disclosure provided an estimate made in accordance with proposed § 205.32 (adopted as § 1005.32 above). The Board also proposed guidance in comment 33(a)-2 regarding the scope of the error under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iii). Furthermore, proposed comment 33(a)-3 provided examples illustrating circumstances in which an incorrect amount of currency may be received by a designated recipient.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter recommended that the exclusion of estimated disclosures made pursuant to § 1005.32 from the definition of “error” under renumbered § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) should be applied to other errors listed in § 1005.33(a)(1). The Bureau notes, however, that none of the other errors in § 1005.33(a)(1) rely on the difference between what may be disclosed as an estimate and the actual amount. For example, suppose a remittance transfer is permitted to estimate disclosures under § 1005.32. If the remittance transfer provider fails to deliver any funds to the designated recipient, the sender should be able to assert an error even though the provider disclosed an estimate. As a result, the Bureau declines to make the requested change, and the exclusion of estimated disclosures made pursuant to § 1005.32 is adopted as renumbered § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii)(A).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau has added language to clarify that the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii)(A) from the definition of “error” applies if the difference results from application of the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes, rather than any estimated amounts. This clarification prevents a remittance transfer provider from relying on the exception for estimates if it makes available to the designated recipient an amount that is completely unrelated to the amount calculated using the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes. For example, if the remittance transfer provider estimated the amount to be received pursuant to § 1005.32 as 1,200 pesos in the receipt or combined disclosure, and the amount calculated using the applicable actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes is 1,150 pesos, the provider cannot use the § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii)(A) exception to claim that there is no error if it made only 100 pesos available to the designated recipient.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail below, several industry commenters requested expansion of the exception to the error defined in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) for extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated. The Bureau believes that it is appropriate to provide this exception for an error involving an incorrect amount received by the designated recipient. For example, suppose a foreign government in the country where a remittance transfer is to be delivered imposes an emergency tax on the transfer that was not in effect nor could have been reasonably anticipated at the time the provider was required to give the sender the receipt or combined disclosure. The failure to make available to the designated recipient the amount of currency identified in the receipt or combined disclosure given to the sender, which did not reflect the emergency tax, should not constitute an error if the designated recipient received the disclosed amount of currency less the emergency tax.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As a result, new § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii)(B) provides that the failure to make the amount of currency stated in the receipt or combined disclosure is not an error if the failure resulted from extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated. Furthermore, the Bureau adopts new comment 33(a)-4 to provide guidance on what types of extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated qualify for the exception. The comment is similar to the comment adopted as comment 33(a)-6 below, which describes extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated for purposes of the error for failure to make funds available by the disclosed date of availability in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 33(a)-2 is adopted with a change to clarify that if a provider rounds the exchange rate used to calculate the amount received consistent with § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) and comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-2 for the disclosed rate, there is no error if the designated recipient receives an amount of currency that results from applying the exchange rate used, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate, to calculate fees, taxes, and the amount received rather than the disclosed rate. The change is intended to be consistent with the Bureau's general approach to rounding exchange rates as described above in the supplementary information to comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-2. Proposed comment 33(a)-3 is adopted substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>33(a)(1)(iv) Failure To Make Funds Available by Date of Availability</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv) generally defined an “error” to include a remittance transfer provider's failure to make funds in connection with a remittance transfer available to the designated recipient by the date of availability stated on the receipt or combined disclosure, subject to two specified exceptions, discussed below. The Board proposed comment 33(a)-4 to provide examples of the circumstances that would have been considered errors under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv). These circumstances included: (i) The late delivery of a remittance transfer after the stated date of availability or non-delivery of the transfer; (ii) the deposit of a remittance transfer to the wrong account; (iii) retention of the transferred funds by a recipient agent or institution after the stated date of availability, rather than making the funds available to the designated recipient; and (iv) the fraudulent pick-up of a remittance transfer in a foreign country by a person other than the person identified by the sender as the designated recipient of the transfer. Fraudulent pick-up, however, did not include circumstances in which a designated recipient picks up a remittance transfer from the provider's agent as authorized, but subsequently the funds are stolen from the recipient.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters objected to the inclusion of fraudulent pick-up as an error. These commenters suggested that the remittance transfer provider should not be responsible for fraud that results in the pick-up of a remittance transfer by a person other than the designated recipient where the provider is unlikely to know or have control over all the intermediary institutions involved in the transfer or the final institution that will make the funds available to the designated recipient. Other commenters, including the OCC, suggested that this error might result in “friendly fraud” where a sender claims the amount was not an authorized pick-up when the pick-up was actually legitimate. The OCC was also concerned that the exposure to remittance transfer providers for this error may be aggravated in situations involving large dollar remittances and because of the long period of time that a sender could assert this error.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter noted that while there may be certain instances when fraudulent pick-up should be considered an error, there may be other circumstances when fraudulent pick-up should not be an error. In particular, this commenter suggested that where the name of the person picking up the funds does not match the name of the designated recipient set forth in the receipt, the sender should be able to assert an error. However, if an individual presents fake identification in the name of the designated recipient, this commenter stated that this fraudulent pick-up is outside of the remittance transfer provider's control and therefore, should not be considered an error. Industry commenters also believed that a remittance transfer provider should not be liable for a fraudulent pick-up when a provider and its agent has complied with fraud and risk management policies and procedures.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As the Board noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, treating fraudulent pick-up of a remittance transfer as an error is consistent with the scope of unauthorized EFTs under § 1005.2(m), which includes unauthorized EFTs initiated through fraudulent means. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 2(m)-3. Although identity theft can present a challenge to remittance transfer providers, financial institutions face similar challenges with respect to unauthorized EFTs and bear most of the risk. Moreover, similar to remittance transfers, the entity in the best position to verify the identity of the person initiating the EFT (for example, the merchant at a store who initiates an EFT using a debit card) may not be known or controlled by the financial institution, though such entities may have agreed to abide by system rules (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> payment card network rules, ACH system rules). However, under current laws governing EFTs, whether the financial institution knows or has control over that entity (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> a merchant) does not affect whether an EFT could be an unauthorized EFT. Similarly, the Bureau believes that whether a fraudulent pick-up should be considered an error should not be affected by the relationship between the remittance transfer provider and the entity distributing the remittance transfer to the designated recipient.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, the Bureau agrees with the Board's reasoning in the May 2011 Proposed Rule that it is appropriate to treat these circumstances as errors because the remittance transfer provider, rather than the sender, is in the best position to ensure that a remittance transfer is picked up only by the person designated by the sender. For example, in some models, remittance transfer providers could require or contract with the entity distributing the funds, if it is not the remittance transfer provider itself, to request and examine identification from the person picking up the funds. The Bureau believes that including fraudulent pick-up as an error would better align the remittance transfer provider's incentives to prevent this occurrence with the interests of the sender.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter suggested that a sender be required to inform the remittance transfer provider if the confirmation number or receipt is lost or stolen. For some remittance transfer providers, a designated recipient is required to give the confirmation number, which is generally printed on the receipt, in order to obtain access to the funds in a remittance transfer. The commenter suggested that this approach would be similar to the approach taken with respect to a lost or stolen access device in § 1005.6(b) with respect to unauthorized EFTs, where a consumer's liability for unauthorized EFTs is dependent on how quickly the consumer reports the lost or stolen access device to the account-holder financial institution.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes, however, the risk for a lost or stolen confirmation number is not the same as for a lost or stolen access device for EFTs. A lost or stolen access device could potentially be used to initiate an EFT by a person who is not the account holder immediately without an accomplice and without identification matching the name associated with the access device. By contrast, where a confirmation number given to the sender is lost or stolen, an unauthorized person who gains access to the number would not be able to take advantage of it unless he or she were located or had an accomplice in the recipient country. Furthermore, because access to funds sent by a remittance transfer provider is often limited to those with identification matching the designated recipient on the receipt, an unauthorized person who gains access to a lost or stolen confirmation number may be deterred from taking advantage of it. Consequently, the Bureau does not believe that a sender's liability should depend on whether he or she reports a confirmation number or receipt as lost or stolen.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Moreover, under § 1005.6(b), a consumer's liability for unauthorized EFTs is dependent on how quickly the consumer reports the lost or stolen access device because the speed with which a consumer reports the lost or stolen access device may be critical to preventing further unauthorized EFTs and further losses, and the possibility of increased liability provides incentives for a consumer to report quickly. In contrast, a lost or stolen confirmation number would not result in losses other than the specific remittance transfer in question. Therefore, the Bureau also does not believe that a sender's liability should depend on how quickly a sender reports a lost or stolen confirmation number.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting comment 33(a)-4, renumbered as comment 33(a)-5, generally as proposed. Specifically, the Bureau is including a statement to clarify that if only a portion of the funds were made available by the disclosed date of availability, then § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) does not apply, but § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) may apply instead.</analysisParagraph>

                  <title>Exceptions to the Failure To Make Funds Available by Date of Availability</title>
                  <analysisParagraph>As noted above, the proposed rule provided two exceptions to the definition of “error” in proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv). Under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(A), the failure to make funds from a remittance transfer available by the stated date of availability did not constitute an error if the failure resulted from circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control. Under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(B), the failure to make funds from a remittance transfer available on the stated date of availability did not constitute an error if it was caused by the sender providing incorrect information in connection with the remittance transfer to the provider, so long as the provider gives the sender the opportunity to correct the information and resend the transfer at no additional cost. The Bureau adopts one of these two exceptions with changes to respond to commenters' concerns, as discussed below. The other exception has been moved to the remedies section under § 1005.33(c)(2) for the reasons discussed below. The Bureau is also adopting two additional exceptions to the definition of “error” in proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv).</analysisParagraph>

                  <title>Exception for Extraordinary Circumstances Outside of the Remittance Transfer Provider's Control</title>
                  <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(A) provided that the failure to make funds from a remittance transfer available by the stated date of availability did not constitute an error if the failure resulted from circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control. Proposed comment 33(a)-5 clarified that the exception was limited to circumstances that are generally referred to under contract law as force majeure, or uncontrollable or extraordinary circumstances that cannot be reasonably anticipated by the remittance transfer provider and that prevent the provider from delivering a remittance transfer, such as war, civil unrest, or a natural disaster. The proposed comment also provided that the exception for circumstances beyond a provider's control covered government actions or other restrictions that occur after the transfer has been sent but that could not have been reasonably anticipated by the remittance transfer provider, such as the imposition of foreign currency controls or the garnishment or attachment of funds.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters stated that the proposed comment limiting the circumstances beyond the provider's control to instances of force majeure or to other uncontrollable or extraordinary circumstances was too narrow. Several industry commenters recommended that the exception should be more broadly interpreted to exclude errors caused by acts of a third party beyond a remittance transfer provider's control. Consumer group commenters believed the approach in the proposed rule was a reasonable limitation and recommended that the commentary specifically state that mistakes by a recipient institution do not fall under the exception to the error to deliver funds by the date of delivery. Other consumer group commenters suggested that the final rule limit the circumstances even further to only include acts of war or terrorism or natural disaster.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau does not believe that whether a particular circumstance constitutes an error or not should necessarily depend on whether a provider is at fault. Even if the error is caused by a third party beyond the remittance transfer provider's control, the Bureau believes that the remittance transfer provider is often in a better position to identify and recover the loss from the third party than a sender, especially when there are multiple intermediary institutions involved in a transfer. Accordingly, the Bureau believes that with respect to third-party errors, the circumstances in proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(A) should include only a narrow category of third-party errors caused by uncontrollable or extraordinary circumstances that cannot be reasonably anticipated by the remittance transfer provider and that prevent the provider from delivering a remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, the Bureau believes the proposed comment is appropriately narrow in interpreting the limited set of circumstances for which the failure to make funds available by the disclosed date of delivery should not be an error. Therefore, proposed comment 33(a)-5 is adopted substantially as proposed in comment 33(a)-6. The Bureau is adopting proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(A) generally as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(A). However, the Bureau is adding language to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(A) to more accurately reflect the descriptions of the types of circumstances listed in comment 33(a)-6. Specifically, § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(A) provides that a failure to make funds available by the disclosed date of delivery is not an error if the failure resulted from extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated.</analysisParagraph>

                  <title>Exception for Sender Providing Incorrect or Insufficient Information</title>
                  <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(B) provided that the failure to make funds from a remittance transfer available on the stated date of availability did not constitute an error if it was caused by the sender providing incorrect information in connection with the remittance transfer to the provider, so long as the provider gives the sender the opportunity to correct the information and resend the transfer at no additional cost. Proposed comment 33(a)-6 clarified that if the failure to make funds from a transfer available by the stated date of availability occurred due to the <em data-original="E-03">provider's</em> miscommunication of information necessary for the designated recipient to pick up the transfer, such as providing the incorrect location where the transfer may be picked up or providing the wrong confirmation number or code for the transfer, such failure would have been treated as an error under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv).</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters objected to the requirement that the remittance transfer provider absorb the costs of amending and resending a transfer when the sender is at fault. These commenters noted that modifying transfers can be expensive and that the proposed rule would, in effect, require the remittance transfer provider and other senders, through higher fees, to bear the responsibility for a sender's mistake.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with commenters that a sender's mistake should not obligate a remittance transfer provider to bear all the costs for resending the remittance transfer. However, the Bureau believes that while the remittance transfer provider should not bear all the costs in these circumstances, the failure should still be considered an error such that the error resolution procedures apply. Therefore, the Bureau is moving the concept in proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(B) to a new § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), and proposed comment 33(a)-6 to renumbered comment 33(c)-2, as discussed further below.</analysisParagraph>

                <analysisSection>
                  <title>Additional Exceptions</title>
                  <analysisParagraph>In the final rule, the Bureau is adding two additional exceptions to the definition of “error” in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) based on a consideration of comments received. New § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(B) provides that delays in making funds available to a designated recipient that are related to a provider's fraud screening procedures or in accordance with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), 31 U.S.C. 5311 <em data-original="E-03">et seq.,</em> Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) requirements, or similar laws or requirements would not constitute an error. Several industry commenters and the OCC noted that for fraud screening, BSA, or OFAC purposes, a remittance transfer provider may have further communications with the sender to ensure the legitimacy or the legality of a remittance transfer. This, in turn, may cause delays in making the funds available to a designated recipient. The Bureau believes it is appropriate to exclude these situations from the definition of “error” in order to encourage remittance transfer providers to continue to engage in activities that benefit the safety of the transfer system as a whole. The Bureau understands that under current procedures, these types of delays are generally infrequent, relative to the number of remittance transfers typically conducted by remittance transfer providers.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adopting a new § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C) in response to industry commenters' and the OCC's concerns about “friendly fraud.” Consequently, consistent with the definition of “unauthorized electronic fund transfer” under § 1005.2(m), and as suggested by the OCC to address its concerns regarding the error of fraudulent pick-up, § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C) provides an exception to the “error” definition for remittance transfers made with fraudulent intent by the sender or any person in concert with the sender. Therefore, if a sender is involved in a scheme to defraud the remittance transfer provider, for example, by fraudulently claiming that the designated recipient did not pick up funds that the designated recipient in fact did pick up, such action would not be considered an “error” under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C).</analysisParagraph>

                <title>33(a)(1)(v) Sender's Request for Documentation</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Finally, under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(v), an error included a sender's request for documentation provided in connection with a remittance transfer or additional information or clarification concerning a remittance transfer. This provision is similar to an existing provision in § 1005.11(a)(1)(vii) for EFTs. As the Board noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, an error under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(v) would also cover a sender's request for information to determine whether an error exists. The Bureau did not receive any comments on proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(v). The Bureau adopts proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(v) substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(a)(1)(v).</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisSection>
                <title>33(a)(2) Types of Inquiries and Transfers Not Covered</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(a)(2) listed circumstances that would not constitute errors. In particular, proposed § 205.33(a)(2)(i) provided that an inquiry about a transfer of $15 or less does not constitute an error, since these small-value transfers do not fall within the scope of the definition of “remittance transfer.” <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.30(e)(2), discussed above. Under proposed § 205.33(a)(2)(ii), an inquiry about the status of a remittance transfer—for example, if the sender calls to ask whether the funds have been made available in the foreign country—would also not be an error (unless the funds have not been made available by the disclosed date of availability). Finally, similar to § 1005.11(a)(2)(ii) for EFTs, a sender's request for information for tax or other recordkeeping purposes would not constitute an error under proposed § 205.33(a)(2)(iii).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that because transfers of $15 or less are not “remittance transfers” under § 1005.30(e)(2), such transfers are not covered under the remittance transfer provisions in subpart B. Therefore, the Bureau believes it is not necessary to state that an inquiry involving a transfer of $15 or less is not an error, and is not adopting proposed § 205.33(a)(2)(i). A Federal Reserve Bank commenter noted that for certain assertions of error that exceed the $15 threshold, providers may still not have the ability to investigate the assertion because they are less than the minimum amount traceable in a foreign country. In order to ensure that senders are protected with respect to errors related to remittance transfers other than truly <em data-original="E-03">de minimis</em> amounts, however, the Bureau is not inclined to create another threshold amount above the $15 coverage threshold for which an inquiry is not an error. The Bureau did not receive comments on proposed § 205.33(a)(2)(ii) or (iii). These provisions are adopted as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(a)(2)(i) and (ii), respectively.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In the final rule, the Bureau is adopting provisions describing two other circumstances that do not constitute errors in response to comments received. Section 1005.33(a)(2)(iii) provides that a change requested by the designated recipient is not an error. Comment 33(a)-7 clarifies new § 1005.33(a)(2)(iii) by providing that the exception is available only if the change is made solely because the designated recipient requested the change. The comment also includes an illustrative example. The example explains that if a sender requests a remittance transfer provider to send US$100 to a designated recipient at a designated location, but the designated recipient requests the amount in a different currency (either at the sender-designated location or another location requested by the recipient) and the remittance transfer provider accommodates the recipient's request, the change does not constitute an error.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau understands that as a service to the recipient, a remittance transfer provider may offer to provide the remittance transfer in a different currency or permit the transfer to be picked up at a location different than originally requested by the sender. In such cases, the Bureau believes that this type of customer service should be preserved. The Bureau, however, is concerned that remittance transfer providers may try to provide the remittance transfer to the designated recipient in a different currency simply because the provider or its agent do not have sufficient amounts of the sender-requested currency on hand. Therefore, the Bureau believes that this exception should only be available if the change is made solely because the designated recipient requested the change.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.33(a)(2)(iv) is also new and provides that an error does not include a change in the amount or type of currency received by the designated recipient from the amount or type of currency stated in the disclosure provided to the sender under § 1005.31(b)(2) or (3) if the remittance transfer provider relied on information provided by the sender as permitted by the commentary accompanying § 1005.31 in making such disclosure. As discussed above, a remittance transfer provider may rely on the sender's representations in making certain disclosures. For example, a remittance transfer provider can rely on the representations of the sender regarding the currency that can be provided in the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>New comment 33(a)-8 elaborates on the exclusion by providing two illustrative examples. Under one example, a sender requests U.S. dollars to be deposited into an account of the designated recipient and represents that the account is U.S. dollar-denominated. If the designated recipient's account is actually denominated in local currency and the recipient account-holding institution must convert the remittance transfer into local currency in order to deposit the funds and complete the transfer, the change in currency does not constitute an error pursuant to § 1005.33(a)(2)(iv). Similarly, if the remittance transfer provider relies on the sender's representations regarding variables that affect the amount of taxes imposed by a person other than the provider for purposes of determining these taxes, the change in the amount of currency the designated recipient actually receives due to the taxes actually imposed does not constitute an error pursuant to § 1005.33(a)(2)(iv).</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisSection>
                <title>33(b) Notice of Error From Sender</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(b) set forth the timing and content requirements for a notice of error provided by a sender in connection with a remittance transfer. Consistent with EFTA section 919(d)(1)(A), proposed § 205.33(b)(1)(i) stated that a sender must provide a notice of error orally or in writing to the remittance transfer provider no later than 180 days after the date of availability of the remittance transfer stated in the receipt or combined disclosure. Under proposed § 205.33(b)(1)(ii), such notice of error must enable the remittance transfer provider to identify: the sender's name and telephone number or address; the recipient's name, and if known, the telephone number or address of the recipient; and the remittance transfer to which the notice of error applies. Proposed § 205.33(b)(1)(iii) stated that the notice must also indicate why the sender believes the error exists and include to the extent possible the type, date, and amount of the error, except in the case of requests for documentation, additional information, or clarification under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(v).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters suggested that the time period for senders to assert an error is too long. Some industry commenters recommended that the time period be shortened to 60 days, similar to the time period that consumers have to assert errors for EFTs. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.11(b)(3). Other industry commenters suggested 30 days. The Bureau notes that the 180-day time period for senders to assert an error is expressly stated in the statute. Given the international nature of remittance transfers, the additional time a sender may need to communicate with persons abroad, and the lack of information about problems associated with this time period, the Bureau does not believe that using its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to change this time period is currently warranted.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters also requested that the sender be required to assert an error in writing at a centralized address. The Bureau believes that requiring senders to assert an error in writing would have a chilling effect on the error resolution process, especially given that some senders may not feel comfortable writing in English. Although in some cases, a sender may have the ability to assert the error in a foreign language and be assured a response in that language, that ability may depend on the foreign languages used at the office of the remittance transfer provider where the error is asserted to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers under § 1005.31(g), as discussed above. Moreover, the current error resolution process for EFTs does not require a consumer to assert an error in writing.<footnote ref="81">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; § 1005.11(b). Although a financial institution may request that a consumer assert the error in writing, a consumer's failure to do so does not cancel the error resolution process, but gives the financial institution 45 days to investigate the error without having to provide provisional credit. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; § 1005.11(b)(2) and (c)(2).</footnote>
                  Therefore, the Bureau declines to make the requested change, and proposed § 205.33(b)(1) is adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(b)(1).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(b)(2) provided that when a notice of error was based on documentation, additional information, or clarification that the sender had previously requested under § 1005.33(a)(1)(v), the sender's notice of error would be timely if it were received by the provider no later than 60 days after the provider sends the requested documentation, information, or clarification. As the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the proposed 60-day time frame for the sender to provide a new notice of error following the sender's receipt of documentation, information, or clarification from the remittance transfer provider is consistent with the 60-day time frame established for similar circumstances under the general error resolution provisions in Regulation E, § 1005.11(b)(3).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with the Board's reasoning that under these circumstances, 60 days, rather than the 180-day error resolution time frame generally applicable to remittance transfers, provides sufficient time for a sender to review the additional information provided by the remittance transfer provider and determine whether an error occurred in connection with a transfer. The Bureau did not receive any comments on this issue. However, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to clarify that a sender always has the original 180 days after the disclosed date of availability to assert an error. Consequently, the Bureau is amending proposed § 205.33(b)(2), renumbered as § 1005.33(b)(2), to provide that when a notice of error is based on documentation, additional information, or clarification that the sender had previously requested under § 1005.33(a)(1)(v), the sender's notice of error is timely if received by the remittance transfer provider the later of 180 days after the disclosed date of availability of the remittance transfer or 60 days after the provider sent the documentation, information, or clarification requested.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed commentary to clarify proposed § 205.33(b). Proposed comment 33(b)-1 clarified that the error resolution procedures for remittance transfers apply only when a notice of error is received from the sender of the transfer. Thus, a notice of error provided by the designated recipient would not trigger the remittance transfer provider's error resolution obligations. As the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, this interpretation is consistent with EFTA section 919(d)(1)(A), which establishes error resolution obligations for a remittance transfer provider only when a notice is received from the sender.<footnote ref="82">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See also&lt;/em&gt; EFTA section 919(g)(1) (providing that a designated recipient “shall not be deemed to be a consumer for purposes of this Act”).</footnote>
                  Proposed comment 33(b)-1 also clarified that the error resolution provisions do not apply when the remittance transfer provider itself discovers and corrects an error. The Bureau did not receive any comments on the proposed comment, which the Bureau adopts as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed comment 33(b)-2 to provide that a notice of error is effective so long as the remittance transfer provider is able to identify the remittance transfer in question. As explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, a sender could provide in the notice of error the confirmation number or code given to the sender for the pick-up of a remittance transfer to identify the particular transfer in their tracking systems and records, or any other identification number or code supplied by the provider in connection with the remittance transfer, if such number or code is sufficient to enable the provider to identify the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter requested that, for an account-based remittance transfer, the final rule require senders to include the account number in the notice of error. The Bureau notes that under comment 11(b)(1)-1 for EFTs, consumers are not required to provide their account numbers and need only provide sufficient information to enable the financial institution to identify the account. Similarly, the Bureau believes that a sender need not provide the account number, but must provide enough information such that the remittance transfer provider can identify the account and the transfer in question. The Bureau adopts comment 33(b)-2 with this clarification, and also makes other clarifying changes to comment 33(b)-2 to make the comment consistent with § 1005.33(b)(1).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 33(b)-3 provided that a remittance transfer provider may request, or the sender may provide, an email address of the sender or the designated recipient, as applicable, instead of a physical address if the email address would be sufficient to enable the provider to identify the remittance transfer to which the notice applies. Proposed comment 33(b)-4 provided that if the sender fails to provide a timely notice of error within 180 days from the stated date of delivery, the remittance transfer provider would not be required to comply with the error resolution requirements set forth in the rule. As the Board noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, proposed comment 33(b)-4 is similar to comment 11(b)(1)-7 for EFTs. The Bureau did not receive any comments on these proposed comments. Therefore, the Bureau adopts comment 33(b)-3 substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>However, given that a sender may provide a second notice of error based on documentation, additional information, or clarification that the sender requested pursuant to § 1005.33(b)(2), as discussed above, the Bureau is revising comment 33(b)-4 to include the time periods relevant to § 1005.33(b)(2). Consequently, comment 33(b)-4 provides that, if applicable, a remittance transfer provider is not required to comply with the error resolution requirements for any notice of error from a sender that is received by the provider more than 60 days after a provider sent documentation, additional information, or clarification requested by the sender, provided such date is later than 180 days after the disclosed date of availability.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed comment 33(b)-5 to provide that a notice of error from a sender received by a remittance transfer provider's agent is deemed to be received by the provider for purposes of the 180-day time frame for reporting errors under § 1005.33(b)(1)(i). Some industry commenters suggested that senders should only be permitted to assert an error at a centralized address or telephone number. These commenters noted that because remittance transfers are not the primary business for most or all of the agents of a remittance transfer provider, relying on an agent to properly forward disputes and relevant supporting documents to the remittance transfer provider would impose unnecessary costs on agents. Commenters also argued that introducing agents into the error resolution process would increase the likelihood that disputes would not be handled and resolved in a timely way.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As the Board noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, a sender that has a problem or issue with a particular remittance transfer may contact the agent location that the sender used to send the transfer to resolve the problem or issue, rather than notifying the provider directly. The Bureau agrees with the Board that because in many cases, for transfers sent through money transmitters, it will be the agent with whom the sender has a direct relationship, and not the provider, it is appropriate to treat a notice of error given to the agent as notice to the provider. This approach also ensures that a sender does not lose his or her error resolution rights merely because the sender was unaware of a need to directly notify the provider. This is consistent with the approach the Bureau is taking with respect to a sender asserting his or her right to cancel, as discussed in further detail below in comment 34(a)-4. Moreover, the Bureau notes that the comment does not require the agent to perform the error resolution procedures. Remittance transfer providers may require their agents to pass on any error notice they receive to the remittance transfer providers, who can then fulfill the requirements of § 1005.33. Therefore, the Bureau adopts proposed comment 33(b)-5 substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Finally, proposed comment 33(b)-6 cross-referenced the disclosure requirements in § 205.31 to reiterate that a remittance transfer provider must include an abbreviated notice of the consumer's error resolution rights on the receipt under § 205.31(b)(2) or combined disclosure under § 205.31(b)(3), as applicable. In addition, the proposed comment provided that the remittance transfer provider must make available to a sender upon request, a notice providing a full description of error resolution rights that is substantially similar to the model error resolution and cancellation notice set forth in Appendix A of this regulation (Model Form A-36). The Bureau did not receive any comments on the proposed comment. The Bureau adopts comment 33(b)-6 substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>33(c) Time Limits and Extent of Investigation</title>
              <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed § 205.33(c) to implement the statutory time frame for investigating errors and set forth the procedures for resolving an error, including the applicable remedies. The Bureau is adopting proposed § 205.33(c) in renumbered § 1005.33(c) with the changes discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisSection>
                <title>33(c)(1) Time Limits for Investigation and Report to Consumer of Error</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Consistent with EFTA section 919(d)(1)(B), proposed § 205.33(c)(1) provided that a remittance transfer provider must promptly investigate a notice of error to determine whether an error occurred within 90 days of receiving the sender's notice. Some industry commenters suggested that the time to investigate a notice of error should be extended. One industry trade association commenter stated that for one of its member banks, while international wire “exceptions” (including non-timely delivery) averaged less than 1% of its international wire transfers, more than 15% of these exceptions took longer than 90 days to resolve.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that the 90-day time period is set by the statute. Furthermore, compared to the time period to resolve errors for EFTs (including those a consumer may have initiated abroad), which can be either 10 business days or 45 calendar days, 90 days is twice the length of the longest allowable time period. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.11(c). Although a longer period than the one available for EFTs may be justified given the international nature of these transactions, the Bureau believes that senders should have errors resolved in a timely manner. Consequently, the Bureau does not believe use of its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to extend the statutorily-imposed 90-day period is warranted.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>To effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Board also proposed to include in proposed § 205.33(c)(1) a requirement that the remittance transfer provider report the results to the sender within three business days after completing its investigation. As the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, this timing is consistent with the time frame for reporting the results of an error investigation under Regulation E, § 1005.11(c)(2)(iv). In addition, under proposed § 205.33(c)(1), the report or notice of results would have to alert the sender of any remedies available for correcting any error that the provider determines has occurred.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(d)(1) does not expressly require a notice to be provided to the sender when the provider determines that an error has occurred. However, the Board proposed to require that a notice be given in these circumstances to alert the sender of the results of the investigation, as well as to inform the sender of available remedies. In proposing this requirement, the Board did not propose that the notice to a sender that an error occurred as asserted had to be in writing because such a requirement could unnecessarily delay a sender's ability to receive an appropriate remedy. Accordingly, the Board proposed comment 33(c)-1 to clarify that if the error occurred as described by the sender, the provider may inform the sender of its findings either orally or in writing. If the error did not occur as described, however, the remittance transfer provider would have to provide a written notice of its findings under § 1005.33(d), as discussed below. The Bureau agrees with the Board's reasoning in proposing both § 205.33(c)(1) and comment 33(c)-1. Accordingly, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to adopt these provisions substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(c)(1) and comment 33(c)-1, respectively.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters also requested that the Bureau specify that the burden of proof should be on the remittance transfer provider so that if a sender presents evidence that there has been an error, the burden should unequivocally shift to the remittance transfer provider to show that there was not an error. The Bureau notes that the EFTA establishes various burdens of proof. For example, under EFTA section 909(b), in any action involving a consumer's liability for an unauthorized EFT, the burden of proof is upon the financial institution to show that the EFT was authorized. However, under EFTA section 910(b), a financial institution is not liable for an incorrect or delayed EFT if it can show by a preponderance of the evidence that its action or failure to act resulted from an act of God or other circumstance beyond its control or a technical malfunction known to the consumer at the time the consumer attempted to initiate the EFT. Section 1073 of the Dodd-Frank Act did not amend the EFTA to adopt a specific burden of proof for errors related to remittance transfers that are not EFTs. Therefore, the Bureau does not believe it is appropriate to address this issue.</analysisParagraph>
              </analysisSection>
              <analysisSection>
                <title>33(c)(2) Remedies</title>
                <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed § 205.33(c)(2) to establish the procedures and remedies for correcting an error. Proposed § 205.33(c)(2)(i) and (ii) included the two remedies that are specified in EFTA section 919(d)(1)(B). Under proposed § 205.33(c)(2), the sender may designate the preferred remedy in the event of an error, consistent with EFTA section 919(d)(1)(B). Thus, under proposed § 205.33(c)(2)(i), the sender could choose to obtain a refund of the amount tendered in connection with the remittance transfer that was not properly transmitted, or an amount appropriate to resolve the error. Alternatively, under proposed § 205.33(c)(2)(ii), the sender could choose to have the remittance transfer provider send to the designated recipient the amount appropriate to resolve the error, at no additional cost to the sender or the designated recipient. The Bureau did not receive any comments objecting to these remedies. Therefore, the statutory remedies set forth in proposed § 205.33(c)(2)(i) and (ii) are adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(c)(2)(i)(A) and (B), respectively, for errors under § 1005.33(a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(iii), and § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) and (<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), respectively, for an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv). Thus, the final rule clarifies that these remedies do not apply to a sender's request for documentation or for additional information or clarification under § 1005.33(a)(1)(v), where the appropriate remedy is the requested documentation, information, or clarification. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) as discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>However, as discussed above with respect to proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(B), the Bureau believes that if the failure to make funds from a remittance transfer available on the disclosed date of availability is caused by the sender providing incorrect information in connection with the remittance transfer to the provider, the sender's mistake should not obligate a remittance transfer provider to bear all the costs for resending the remittance transfer. As noted above, many industry commenters objected to the requirement that the remittance transfer provider absorb the costs of amending and resending a transfer when the sender is at fault because doing so would require the remittance transfer provider and other senders, through higher fees, to bear the responsibility for a sender's mistake.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Therefore, § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) does not require that providers send to the designated recipient the amount appropriate to resolve the error at no additional cost to the sender or the designated recipient if the sender provided incorrect information in connection with the remittance transfer to the provider. Instead, § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) provides that if the sender provided incorrect information to the remittance transfer provider in connection with the remittance transfer, third party fees may be imposed for resending the remittance transfer with the corrected information. Section 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) permits third party fees and taxes that were actually incurred in the earlier transmission attempt to be imposed for the resend, but does not permit remittance transfer providers to charge senders a second time for the provider's own fees.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is making this distinction in order to apply the rule without requiring complicated individualized analyses and allocations of the expenses actually incurred in connection with a failed transaction. The Bureau believes this approach strikes a more appropriate balance between the interests of providers and senders than the proposed rule of not permitting any fees to be imposed for the resend, given that third party fees and taxes are not controlled by the provider and are simply being passed on from other actors. Furthermore, the Bureau believes that affiliates of remittance transfer providers, like providers themselves, should not assess fees for resending a remittance transfer with corrected information.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also believes that if a sender provides insufficient information to enable the remittance transfer provider to complete the transfer as requested, third party fees should be permitted to be imposed for resending the remittance transfer with the additional information. For example, a sender may only provide a partial name for the designated recipient such that the entity distributing the funds cannot determine whether the person picking up the funds or the name associated with the account is the intended designated recipient. Therefore, § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) provides that if the sender provided insufficient information to the remittance transfer provider in connection with the remittance transfer, third party fees may be imposed for resending the remittance transfer with the additional information.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adopting a new comment 33(c)-2 to clarify § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>). The comment generally incorporates proposed comment 33(a)-6 to clarify that if the failure to make funds from a transfer available by the disclosed date of availability occurred due to the provider's miscommunication of information necessary for the designated recipient to pick up the transfer, such as providing the incorrect location where the transfer may be picked up or providing the wrong confirmation number or code for the transfer, such failure would not be treated as a failure caused by the sender providing incorrect or insufficient information in connection with the remittance transfer to the provider. The comment also clarifies that while third party fees may be imposed for resending the remittance transfer with the corrected or additional information, the remittance transfer provider may not require the sender to provide the principal transfer amount again.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, if funds were not exchanged in the first unsuccessful attempt of the remittance transfer, the provider must use the exchange rate it is using for such transfers on the date of the resend. The Bureau recognizes that this approach is different from the approach adopted for other errors, where the provider must apply the exchange rate stated in the receipt or combined disclosure. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 33(c)-3, discussed below. For errors where the failure was not caused by the sender providing incorrect or insufficient information, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate for the remedy to reflect what was promised to the sender. In contrast, when the failure is caused by the sender providing incorrect or insufficient information, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to generally put the provider and the sender in the same position as if the first unsuccessful attempt of the remittance transfer had never occurred.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>For example, if a sender instructs a remittance transfer provider to send US$100 to a designated recipient in a foreign country in local currency, for which the remittance transfer provider charges a transfer fee of US$10, and the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information that resulted in non-delivery of the remittance transfer, the remittance transfer provider may not require the sender to provide another US$100 to the remittance transfer provider to send or charge the sender another US$10 transfer fee. If the funds were not exchanged in the first unsuccessful attempt of the remittance transfer, the provider must use the exchange rate it is using for such transfers on the date of the resend.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Based on this rule, if a remittance transfer is deposited in an account that does not belong to the designated recipient named in the receipt because the sender provided the wrong account number for the designated recipient, the provider may charge the sender for resending the remittance transfer, but may not have the sender provide the principal transfer amount again in the event that the remittance transfer provider is unable to have the funds extracted from the wrong account. The Bureau believes that this approach will encourage providers and other parties involved in the remittance transfer to develop security procedures to limit the risk of funds being deposited in an account when the name of the designated recipient named in the receipt does not match the name associated with the account number. The Bureau notes that remittance transfer providers will be supplied with both the name, and if provided by the sender, the telephone number and/or address of the designated recipient, which the provider must disclose on the receipt under § 1005.31(b)(2)(iii).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>New comment 33(c)-2 clarifies that although third party fees may be imposed on the sender for resending the remittance transfer with the corrected or additional information, third party fees that were not incurred during the first unsuccessful remittance transfer attempt may not be imposed again for resending the remittance transfer. For example, suppose a sender instructed the remittance transfer provider to send US$100 to a designated recipient in a foreign country, for which a remittance transfer provider charges a transfer fee of US$10 and an intermediary institution charges a lifting fee of US$5, such that the designated recipient is expected to receive only US$95, as indicated in the receipt. If the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information that resulted in non-delivery of the remittance transfer and the US$5 lifting fee was incurred in the first attempt, the sender may choose to provide an additional amount to offset the US$5 lifting fee deducted in the first unsuccessful remittance transfer attempt and ensure that the designated recipient receives US$95 or may choose to resend the US$95 amount with the understanding that another fee may be deducted by the intermediary institution, as indicated in the receipt. Otherwise, if the US$5 lifting fee was not incurred in the first attempt, then the remittance transfer provider must send the original US$100 for the resend, and the sender may expect a US$5 lifting fee to be imposed by the intermediary institution, as indicated in the receipt. Comment 33(c)-2 also reminds providers that a request to resend a remittance transfer is a request to send a remittance transfer. Therefore, a provider must provide the disclosures required by § 1005.31 for a resend of a remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Board proposed to add a separate, cumulative remedy that would apply if the transfer was not made available to the designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv). This additional remedy was proposed pursuant to the Board's authority under EFTA section 919(d)(1)(B) to provide “such other remedy” as the Board determines appropriate “for the protection of senders.” Under proposed § 205.33(c)(2)(iii), if the remittance transfer was not sent or delivered to the designated recipient by the stated date of availability, the remittance transfer provider would be required to refund all fees charged or imposed in connection with the transfer, even if the consumer asks the provider to send the remittance transfer to the designated recipient as the preferred remedy. If the funds have already been delivered to the recipient, however, even if on an untimely basis, the sole remedy in such case would be the refund of fees.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters objected to the remedy to refund all fees associated with the remittance transfer. As the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, requiring the provider to refund all fees imposed in connection with the remittance transfer, including the transfer fee, is appropriate under such circumstances because the sender did not receive the contracted service, specifically the availability of funds in connection with the transfer by the disclosed date. Furthermore, the Board noted that in some cases, the sender may have paid an additional fee for expedited delivery of funds.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Based on some industry comments, the Bureau believes there may be some confusion regarding when the proposed remedy of refunding fees associated with the remittance transfer may be available. As stated in proposed § 205(c)(2)(iii), the remedy is only available in the case of an error asserted under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv) (adopted as § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) above). Accordingly, if the remittance transfer provider finds that the error that occurred is, for example, an incorrect amount paid by a sender in connection with a remittance transfer under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(i) (adopted as § 1005.33(a)(1)(i) above), the provider would be under no obligation to refund the fees associated with the remittance transfer to a sender. Instead, the only remedies required to be available to a sender would be a refund of the amount appropriate to resolve the error under proposed § 205(c)(2)(i) (adopted as § 1005(c)(2)(i)(A) above) or to have the amount appropriate to resolve the error sent to the designated recipient, at no additional cost to the sender or the designated recipient under proposed § 205.33(c)(2)(ii) (adopted as § 1005(c)(2)(i)(B) above).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with the Board that the remedy of refunding all fees imposed for the remittance transfer is appropriate if the remittance transfer was not made available to the designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, the Bureau believes that taxes should also be refunded. One industry commenter noted that for certain jurisdictions, the remittance transfer provider may be prohibited by law from refunding taxes. Therefore, the Bureau adopts proposed § 205.33(c)(2)(iii) in renumbered § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B) with the additional requirement to refund taxes to the extent not prohibited by law.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Moreover, consistent with § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), which provides that third party fees may be imposed for resending the remittance transfer if the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information to the remittance transfer provider in connection with the remittance transfer, § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B) provides that the provider need not refund fees imposed for the remittance transfer if the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information to the remittance transfer provider in connection with the remittance transfer. The Bureau is also adopting new § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) to clarify that in the case of an error asserted under § 1005.33(a)(1)(v), which is a request for documentation, additional information or clarification concerning a remittance transfer, the appropriate remedy is providing the requested documentation, information, or clarification.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(c)(2) also provided that the remittance transfer provider must correct the error within one business day of, or as soon as reasonably practicable after, receiving the sender's instructions regarding the appropriate remedy. The Board explained that the proposed rule would provide additional flexibility to address the limited circumstances where the particular method of sending a remittance transfer may present practical impediments to a provider's ability to correct an error within one business day. For example, it may not be practicable for a wire transfer that goes through several intermediary institutions before reaching the designated recipient to make the amount in error available to the recipient within one business day in accordance with a sender's request. The Bureau agrees with the Board's rationale in requiring the remittance transfer provider to correct the error within one business day of, or as soon as reasonably practicable after, receiving the sender's instructions regarding the appropriate remedy. The Bureau retains this aspect of proposed § 205.33(c)(2) in renumbered § 1005.33(c)(2) and also includes other clarifying, non-substantive changes.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 33(c)-2 clarified that the remittance transfer provider may request that the sender designate the preferred remedy at the time the sender provides notice of error. As the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, permitting such requests may enable providers to process error claims more expeditiously without waiting for the sender's subsequent instructions after notifying the sender of the results of the investigation. If the sender does not indicate the desired remedy at the time of providing notice of error, the proposed comment provided that the remittance transfer provider must notify the sender of any available remedies in the report provided under proposed § 205.33(c)(1) (adopted as § 1005(c)(1) above) after determining an error occurred. Proposed comment 33(c)-2 is adopted as comment 33(c)-3.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>However, the Board recognized in the May 2011 Proposed Rule that by giving the sender the ability to choose the remedy, the statute, and thus the rule, may make it impossible for a remittance transfer provider to promptly correct an error if the consumer fails to designate an appropriate remedy either at the time of providing the notice of error or in response to the provider's notice informing the consumer of its error determination and available remedies. The Board therefore requested comment on whether remittance transfer providers should be permitted to select a default method of correcting errors.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Both industry and consumer group commenters agreed that there should be a default method of correcting errors. Industry commenters suggested that the remittance transfer provider should be permitted to select the default remedy. Consumer group commenters, however, recommended that the Bureau should set the default remedy of refunding to the sender the appropriate amount.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Based on the comments received, the Bureau adopts a new comment 33(c)-4 to permit a remittance transfer provider to select a default remedy that the provider will use if the sender does not designate a remedy within a reasonable time after the sender receives the report provided under § 1005.33(c)(1). The Bureau believes that providing for a default remedy after a sender has had a reasonable opportunity to choose a remedy would balance the statute's aim to provide a sender the chance to choose his or her preferred remedy with the goal of promptly resolving the sender's outstanding error claim. Furthermore, allowing remittance transfer providers to select the default remedy reduces burden on providers without consumer harm because providers have the ability to provide a preferred remedy without compromising a sender's opportunity to choose.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In addition, new comment 33(c)-4 provides a safe harbor for the amount of time that would be considered reasonable after the report under § 1005.33(c)(1) is provided. Specifically, comment 33(c)-4 states that a provider that permits a sender to designate a remedy within 10 days after the provider has sent the report provided under § 1005.33(c)(1) before selecting the default remedy is deemed to have provided the sender with a reasonable time to designate a remedy. In selecting the 10-day time frame as a safe harbor, the Bureau notes the existence of a similar provision under Regulation Z. Under the commentary to 12 CFR 1026.5(b)(1)(i), a creditor that provides an account-opening disclosure in connection with a balance transfer may effectuate the balance transfer if the consumer has not withdrawn the balance transfer request within 10 days after the creditor has sent the account-opening disclosure. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 5(b)(1)(i)-5 under Regulation Z. New comment 33(c)-4 also clarifies that in the case a default remedy is provided, the remittance transfer provider must correct the error within one business day, or as soon as reasonably practicable, after the reasonable time for the sender to designate the remedy has passed.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters also suggested that the Bureau adopt guidance on how to handle cases where a sender cannot be contacted after an error is discovered by the provider, sender, or recipient. These commenters recommended that three phone calls or emails should constitute a good faith effort to contact the sender. The Bureau notes that the error resolution procedures only apply if the sender asserts an error. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 33(b)-1 adopted above. A notice of error from a sender must contain information to enable the provider to identify the sender's name and telephone number or address. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(b)(1)(ii)(A) adopted above. Therefore, the Bureau believes that remittance transfer providers will have valid contact information from the sender when the sender asserts the error and that remittance transfer providers will make a reasonable effort to contact senders to fulfill their error resolution requirements.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters requested that the final rule clarify the meaning of “amount appropriate to resolve the error.” The Bureau agrees that clarification of this term would be helpful. New comment 33(c)-5 provides that for the purposes of the remedies set forth in § 1005.33(c)(2)(i)(A), (c)(2)(i)(B), (c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>), and (c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), the amount appropriate to resolve the error is the specific amount of transferred funds that should have been received if the remittance transfer had been effected without error. New comment 33(c)-5 further clarifies that the amount appropriate to resolve the error does not include consequential damages.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters requested further guidance on the form a refund may take. In particular, commenters were concerned that remittance transfer providers not be permitted to provide store credit in the refund amount. The Bureau agrees that the form of any refund provided under § 1005.33(c)(2)(i)(A) should generally be the same as the form of payment for the remittance transfer. The Bureau also believes that a provider should also be permitted to provide a refund in cash. Therefore, the Bureau adopts new comment 33(c)-6 to clarify that a remittance transfer provider may, at its discretion, issue a refund either in cash or in the same form of payment that was initially provided by the sender for the remittance transfer. The comment is similar to comment 34(b)-1, discussed below, regarding the form of refund after a cancellation.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is, however, amending comment 34(b)-1 in one respect, which is also reflected in new comment 33(c)-6. Specifically, the Bureau recognizes that if a sender provided cash to the remittance transfer provider for the remittance transfer, there may be instances when a cash refund may not be possible or convenient to the sender. Generally, it is undesirable for a provider to mail cash, and agents may be prohibited from providing cash to consumers. Even if agents were permitted to provide cash refunds, it may be inconvenient to the sender to return to the remittance transfer provider or agent location to pick up the cash refund. Consequently, comments 33(c)-6 and 34(b)-1 state that a provider may issue a refund by check if a sender initially provided cash for the remittance transfer. For example, if the sender originally provided cash as payment for the transfer, the provider may mail a check to the sender in the amount of the payment.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters also suggested that the Bureau consider emphasizing that remittance transfer providers should comply with applicable State escheat laws if the sender cannot be contacted to receive a refund. The Bureau believes that such clarification is unnecessary. Furthermore, the Bureau is concerned that an explicit reference to State escheat laws in this instance may imply that other State laws (for example, State disclosure requirements for money transmitters) do not apply. Consequently, the Bureau declines to adopt this suggestion.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 33(c)-3 provided additional guidance regarding the appropriate remedies where the sender has paid an excess amount to send a remittance transfer. Under that circumstance, the sender may request a refund of the amount paid in excess or may request that the remittance transfer provider make that excess amount available to the designated recipient at no additional cost. The Bureau did not receive any comments on the proposed comment. The Bureau adopts proposed comment 33(c)-3 substantially as proposed in comment 33(c)-7.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Under proposed comment 33(c)-4, fees that must be refunded to a sender for a failure to make funds from a remittance transfer available by the stated date of availability under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) include all fees imposed for the transfer, regardless of the party that imposed the fee, and are not limited to fees imposed by the provider. Some industry commenters objected to having to refund fees not imposed by the remittance transfer provider. As explained above, however, the Bureau believes that refunding all fees is appropriate if the remittance transfer service was not provided as contracted because the funds were not made available by the disclosed date of availability.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is revising proposed comment 33(c)-4, however, to respond to a request from a Federal Reserve Bank commenter to resolve ambiguities in the relationship between the remedies in § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) and (<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) and the remedy in § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B). Specifically, the Bureau has revised proposed comment 33(c)-4, renumbered as comment 33(c)-8, to clarify that the remittance transfer provider must correct the error in accordance with § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A), as applicable. Therefore, if the remittance transfer was made available to the designated recipient, but on an untimely basis, the remedies under § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A) would not be applicable. In that circumstance, the “amount appropriate to resolve the error” would be zero since the entire transfer amount was made available to the designated recipient. The sender's only remedy in this case would be the refund of fees under § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B). If, however, the funds were never made available to the designated recipient, then the sender would have one of the remedies available under § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) or (<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) in addition to the remedy of the fee refund under § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B). The Bureau also believes the renumbering in § 1005.33(c)(2) should make this clear.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 33(c)-5 clarified that if an error occurred, whether as alleged or in a different amount or manner, a remittance transfer provider may not impose any charges related to any aspect of the error resolution process, including any charges for documentation or investigation. As discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the Board expressed concern that such fees or charges might have a chilling effect on a sender's good faith assertion of errors and noted that the proposed comment is similar to comment 11(c)-3 for EFTs. Proposed 33(c)-5, however, also stated that nothing would prohibit a remittance transfer provider from imposing a fee for making copies of documentation for non-error-resolution-related purposes, such as for tax documentation purposes under § 1005.33(a)(2)(iii). The Bureau did not receive any comments on the proposed comment. Therefore, the Bureau adopts proposed comment 33(c)-5 as proposed in comment 33(c)-9.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Finally, under proposed comment 33(c)-6, a remittance transfer provider may correct an error, without further investigation, in the amount or manner alleged by the sender to be in error. This is similar to comment 11(c)-4 for EFTs. As with comment 11(c)-4, the provider must otherwise comply with all other applicable requirements of the error resolution procedures, including providing notice of the resolution of the error. Commenters did not address this proposed comment. Therefore, the Bureau adopts proposed comment 33(c)-6 substantially as proposed in comment 33(c)-10.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>33(d) Procedures if Remittance Transfer Provider Determines No Error or Different Error Occurred</title>
              <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed § 205.33(d) to establish procedures in the event that a remittance transfer provider determines that no error or a different error occurred from that described by the sender. Specifically, proposed § 205.33(d)(1) stated that the remittance transfer provider must provide a written explanation of the provider's finding that there was no error or that a different error occurred, consistent with EFTA section 919(d)(1)(B)(iv). Such explanation would have to respond to the sender's specific complaint and note the sender's right to request the documents that the provider relied on in making its determination. Furthermore, under proposed § 205.33(d)(2), the remittance transfer provider would be required to promptly provide copies of such documentation upon the sender's request.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Under proposed comment 33(d)-1, if a remittance transfer provider determined that an error occurred in a manner or amount different from that described by the sender, the provider would be required to comply with applicable provisions of both § 1005.33(c) and (d) (proposed as § 205.33(c) and (d)). Similar to comment 11(d)-1 with respect to error investigations involving EFTs, the provider may choose to give the notice of correction of error under § 1005.33(c)(1) (proposed as § 205.33(c)(1)) and the explanation that a different error occurred under § 1005.33(d) (proposed as § 205.33(d)) separately or in a combined form. The Bureau did not receive any comments on the procedures set forth in proposed § 205.33(d) or comment 33(d)-1. The Bureau adopts these provisions substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(d) and comment 33(d)-1.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>33(e) Reassertion of Error</title>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, under proposed § 205.33(e), a remittance transfer provider that has fully complied with the error resolution requirements with respect to a particular notice of error would have no further responsibilities in the event the sender later reasserts the same error, except in the case of an error asserted following the sender's receipt of information provided under § 1005.33(a)(1)(v). Furthermore, proposed comment 33(e)-1 explained that the remittance transfer provider would have no further error resolution responsibilities if the sender voluntarily withdraws the notice alleging an error. In such case, however, the sender would retain the right to reassert the allegation within the original 180-day period from the disclosed date of availability unless the remittance transfer provider had already complied with all of the error resolution requirements before the allegation was withdrawn. As noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the proposed provision and comment were modeled on similar provisions under § 1005.11(e). The Board requested comment on whether additional guidance is necessary regarding the circumstances in which a sender has “voluntarily withdrawn” a notice of error.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Commenters did not generally address proposed § 205.33(e) or proposed comment 33(e)-1. However, one industry commenter suggested that the error resolution process under proposed § 205.33 should be the exclusive remedy for the enumerated errors. EFTA section 916 provides that there is no civil liability for an error resolved in accordance with the error resolution procedures set forth in EFTA section 908, which are the error resolution procedures implemented in § 1005.11. The Bureau notes that EFTA section 916 was not amended to include the error resolution procedures for remittance transfers set forth in EFTA section 919(d). As such, under EFTA section 916, a court could find that there is civil liability even for an error that has been resolved in accordance with the error resolution procedures in § 1005.33. Accordingly, the Bureau adopts proposed § 205.33(e) as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(e) . The Bureau adopts comment 33(e)-1 with one change to include the time period relevant to an error asserted pursuant to § 1005.33(b)(2) after a sender receives requested documentation, additional information or clarification from the remittance transfer provider.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>33(f) Relation to Other Laws</title>
              <analysisParagraph>As the Board noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the error resolution rights for remittance transfers exist independently from other rights that a consumer may have under other existing Federal law. Proposed § 205.33(f) contains guidance regarding the interplay between the error resolution provisions for remittance transfers and error resolution rights that may exist under other applicable consumer financial protection laws.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed § 205.33(f)(1) to implement the provision in EFTA section 919(e)(1) regarding the applicability of the remittance transfer error resolution provisions to EFTs. The proposed rule provided that if an alleged error in connection with a remittance transfer involved an incorrect EFT to a sender's account and the account was also held by the remittance transfer provider, then the requirements of proposed § 205.33, and its applicable time frames and procedures, governed the error resolution process. If the notice of error was asserted with an account-holding institution that was not the same entity as the remittance transfer provider, however, proposed § 205.33(f)(1) provided that the error resolution procedures under § 205.11 (currently § 1005.11), and not those under § 205.33, would apply to the account-holding institution's investigation of the alleged error.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>An electronic fund transfer from a consumer's account may also be a remittance transfer. But, as the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, an account-holding institution would likely be unable to identify a particular EFT as a remittance transfer unless it was also the remittance transfer provider. In the absence of direct knowledge that a particular EFT was used to fund a remittance transfer, the account-holding institution would face significant compliance risk if the error resolution requirements under proposed § 205.33 were deemed to apply to the error.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with the Board that such an outcome would be undesirable. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 205.33(f)(1) in renumbered § 1005.33(f)(1) to permit an account-holding institution to comply with the error resolution requirements of § 1005.11 when the institution is not also the remittance transfer provider for the transaction in question. In such a case, the sender will also have independent error resolution rights against the remittance transfer provider itself under § 1005.33.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters thought the proposed guidance was confusing and would apply more than one error resolution procedure to a remittance transfer provider. Although certain remittance transfer providers may have multiple error resolution obligations, these provisions are meant to resolve conflicts and provide greater certainty about which error resolution provisions apply in certain situations. Therefore, the Bureau is revising comment 33(f)-1 to provide such clarification.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Revised comment 33(f)-1 provides that a financial institution that is also the remittance transfer provider may have error obligations under both §§ 1005.11 and 1005.33. The comment provides examples to illustrate when certain error resolution procedures apply to a remittance transfer provider that is also the account-holding institution from which the transfer is funded. In the first example, a sender asserts an error under § 1005.11 with a remittance transfer provider that holds the sender's account, and the error is not also an error under § 1005.33, such as an omission of an EFT from a periodic statement. In this case, the error-resolution provisions of § 1005.11 exclusively apply to the error. In the second example, a sender asserts an error under § 1005.33 with a remittance transfer provider that holds the sender's account, and the error is also an error under § 1005.11, such as when the amount the sender requested to be deducted from the sender's account and sent for the remittance transfer differs from the amount that was actually deducted from the account and sent. In this case, the error-resolution provisions of § 1005.33 exclusively apply to the error.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(f)(2) addressed the scenario where the consumer provides a notice of error to the creditor that issued the credit card with respect to an alleged error involving an incorrect extension of credit in connection with a remittance transfer, such as when a consumer provides a credit card to pay for a remittance transfer. Proposed § 205.33(f)(2) provided that, in such a case, the error resolution provisions of Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.13, would apply to the creditor, rather than the requirements under proposed § 205.33. Proposed § 205.33(f)(2) also stated that if the sender instead provides a notice of error asserting an incorrect payment amount involving the use of a credit card to the remittance transfer provider, then the error resolution provisions of proposed § 205.33 would apply to the remittance transfer provider.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>A creditor of a credit card or other credit account may also act as a remittance transfer provider in certain circumstances, such as when a cardholder sends funds from his or her credit card through a service offered by the creditor to a recipient in a foreign country. In this case, an error could potentially be asserted under either Regulation Z or the error resolution provisions applicable to remittance transfers in the case of an incorrect extension of credit in connection with the transfer. The Board proposed that under these circumstances, the error resolution provisions under Regulation Z § 1026.13 would apply to the alleged error, but solicited comment on the proposed approach.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>One commenter suggested that if a remittance transfer provider is serving multiple roles, such as a creditor that is also a remittance transfer provider, the remittance transfer provider should have the ability to choose which error resolution procedure to follow. The Bureau does not believe that remittance transfer providers should be permitted to choose the error resolution procedure to apply because providers and senders would benefit from the application of consistent procedures in similar situations.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with the Board that it is reasonable to apply the Regulation Z error resolution provisions under circumstances where the remittance transfer provider is also the creditor because Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.13(d)(1) permits a consumer to withhold disputed amounts while an error is being investigated. However, the Bureau believes that the additional time afforded to a sender to assert an error under § 1005.33 may also be of value. Therefore, for a remittance transfer provider that is also the creditor, the Bureau is requiring that the time period to assert an error under § 1005.33(b) should apply instead of the time period under 12 CFR 1026.13(b). This will also ensure that the error resolution notice required under § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) is consistent. Otherwise, disclosing to a sender that the time period to assert an error may in some instances be 60 days from the periodic statement reflecting the error and in other instances may be 180 days from the disclosed date of availability on the remittance transfer receipt could be confusing.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also believes further clarification is warranted for errors other than incorrect extensions of credit in connection with the remittance transfer. For example, an error involving an incorrect amount of currency received under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) or the failure to make funds available by the disclosed date of availability under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) may be asserted as an error involving goods or services that have not been delivered as agreed under § 1026.13(a)(3). Accordingly, the Bureau is adding these references to the final rule to resolve any potential conflicts. The Bureau adopts § 205.33(f)(2) in renumbered § 1005.33(f)(2) with these revisions and amendments to clarify that the provision applies to all credit accounts rather than only credit card accounts.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau notes that in certain circumstances, a credit cardholder has a right to assert claims or defenses against a card issuer concerning property or services purchased with a credit card under Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.12(c)(1). These rights are independent of other billing error rights a cardholder may have. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 12(c)-1 to 12 CFR 1026.12(c). Therefore, the Bureau is adopting a new comment 33(f)-2 to clarify that to the extent a credit cardholder has a right to assert claims and defenses against a card issuer under 12 CFR 1026.12(c)(1), nothing in § 1005.33 limits a sender's right in this regard.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Board also proposed § 205.33(f)(3) to provide guidance where an alleged error involves an unauthorized EFT or unauthorized use of a credit card to send a remittance transfer, such as when a stolen debit or credit card is used to send funds to a foreign country. Specifically, proposed § 205.33(f)(3) clarified that the consumer would have rights under Regulation E §§ 1005.6 and 1005.11 in the case of an unauthorized EFT or Regulation Z §§ 1026.12(b) and 1026.13 in the case of an unauthorized use of a credit card. However, since the consumer holding the asset account or the credit card account is not the sender of the remittance transfer, proposed § 205.33(f)(3) stated that the error resolution provisions for remittance transfers would not apply. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 33(b)-1. The Bureau agrees with the Board's proposal, and § 205.33(f)(3) is adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(f)(3) with an amendment to clarify application of the provision to credit accounts generally as opposed to only credit card accounts.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters suggested that the reasoning the Board used in applying Regulation E §§ 1005.6 and 1005.11 in the case of an unauthorized EFT and Regulation Z §§ 1026.12(b) and 1026.13 in the case of an unauthorized use of a credit card, should be used in applying UCC Article 4A provisions to an unauthorized wire transfer. As discussed above in the supplementary information to § 1005.30(e), UCC Article 4A-108 provides that Article 4A does not apply “to a funds transfer, <em data-original="E-03">any part of which is governed by the [EFTA]”</em> (emphasis added). Furthermore, as discussed above, the Bureau may only preempt State law to the extent that there is an inconsistency. Since the Bureau does not believe there is an inconsistency between the EFTA and UCC Article 4A-108, UCC Article 4A does not apply to wire transfers that are remittance transfers under § 1005.30(e). Therefore, the Bureau declines to implement commenters' suggestion with respect to unauthorized wire transfers.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Board noted that in certain cases a consumer may be able to assert error resolution rights in connection with a remittance transfer with both the remittance transfer provider as well as the account-holding institution or credit card issuer or creditor. Proposed comment 33(f)-2 addressed this situation by providing that if a sender receives credit to correct an error of an incorrect amount paid in connection with a remittance transfer from either the remittance transfer provider or the sender's account-holding institution or creditor, and then subsequently asserts the same error with the other party, the other party would have no further responsibilities to investigate the error. The proposed comment also clarified that an account-holding institution or creditor may reverse amounts it has previously credited to correct an error if the consumer receives more than one credit to correct the same error and provided an example to illustrate this concept.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter noted that the provisions in § 1005.33(f) could provide a consumer with potentially different error resolution procedures depending on who the consumer decides to contact. This may be the case if the remittance transfer provider is not also the account-holding institution or creditor. However, proposed comment 33(f)-2 explains that the second party has no error resolution obligations if the sender already received credit to correct an error of an incorrect amount paid in connection with a remittance transfer. This comment makes clear that a consumer may not receive a windfall by successfully asserting an error with both the provider and the account-holding institution and/or credit card issuer or creditor.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Another industry commenter suggested that the remittance transfer provider should be permitted to delay providing a remedy until expiration of the card issuer's chargeback right under network rules to prevent duplicate recoveries when remittances are funded by a debit card or a credit card. The Bureau believes that the delay would be disadvantageous for senders in getting a speedy resolution to an error and that proposed comment 33(f)-2 is a better method for dealing with the possibility of duplicate recoveries. The Bureau adopts this comment, renumbered as comment 33(f)-3, substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Lastly, the Bureau received comment from an industry commenter questioning which error resolution provisions apply when a sender has multiple funding sources for the remittance transfer. For example, a sender could fund a remittance transfer partly by a balance in the sender's account held by the remittance transfer provider and partly by a credit card or an ACH transfer from the sender's checking account. In such cases, the Bureau notes that which error resolution procedure will apply depends on the error that is asserted. For example, if the error asserted is the incorrect extension of credit in connection with the remittance transfer, then § 1005.33(f)(2) provides that § 1026.13 applies to the creditor while § 1005.33 applies to the remittance transfer provider, but only with respect to the amount of the remittance transfer funded by the credit card. However, if the remittance transfer provider is also the creditor, only § 1026.13 applies to the remittance transfer provider with respect to the amount of the remittance transfer funded by the credit card.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Similarly, if the error asserted is an incorrect EFT from a sender's account, then § 1005.33(f)(1) provides that § 1005.11 applies to the account-holding institution while § 1005.33 applies to the remittance transfer provider, but only with respect to the amount of the remittance transfer funded by the debit card or the ACH transfer from the sender's account. However, if the remittance transfer provider is also the account-holding institution, only § 1005.33 applies to the remittance transfer provider with respect to the amount of the remittance transfer funded by the debit card or the ACH transfer from the sender's account. The Bureau believes the regulation and commentary as adopted provide sufficient guidance in this regard, and additional clarification is not necessary.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to EFTA section 919(d)(2), the Bureau must establish clear and appropriate standards for remittance transfer providers with respect to error resolution relating to remittance transfers, to protect senders from such errors. EFTA section 919(d)(2) specifically provides that such standards must include appropriate standards regarding recordkeeping, including retention of certain error-resolution related documentation. The Board proposed § 205.33(g) to implement these error resolution standards and recordkeeping requirements.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Specifically, proposed § 205.33(g)(1) provided that a remittance transfer provider must develop and maintain written policies and procedures that are designed to ensure compliance with respect to the error resolution requirements applicable to remittance transfers. The proposed rule also stated that remittance transfer providers must take steps to ensure that whenever a provider uses an agent to perform any of the provider's error resolution obligations, the agent conducts such activity in accordance with the provider's policies and procedures. As noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, this approach is similar to one taken by the Federal banking agencies in other contexts. <em data-original="E-03">See, e.g.,</em> 12 CFR 1022.90(e) (requiring that an identity theft red flags program exercise appropriate and effective oversight of service-provider arrangements).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter suggested that the failure to maintain written policies and procedures should not be an independent cause of action. The Bureau believes that remittance transfer providers must develop written policies and procedures in order to demonstrate compliance to the appropriate regulator. Therefore, the Bureau does not believe the requirement to maintain written policies and procedures that the remittance transfer provider must follow imposes any additional burden.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is making one change to proposed § 205.33(g)(1). Specifically, the Bureau is deleting the provision in proposed § 205.33(g)(1) that requires remittance transfer providers to take steps to ensure that when a provider uses an agent to perform any of the provider's error resolution obligations, the agent conducts such activity in accordance with the provider's policies and procedures. The Bureau believes that this provision is no longer necessary in light of the decision under § 1005.35, discussed below, to provide that a remittance transfer provider is liable for any violation of subpart B by an agent when such agent acts for the provider. Proposed § 205.33(g)(1), as revised, is adopted in renumbered § 1005.33(g)(1).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Under proposed § 205.33(g)(2) a remittance transfer provider's policies and procedures concerning error resolution would be required to include provisions regarding the retention of documentation related to an error investigation. Such provisions would be required to ensure, at a minimum, the retention of any notices of error submitted by a sender, documentation provided by the sender to the provider with respect to the alleged error, and the findings of the remittance transfer provider regarding the investigation of the alleged error, which is consistent with EFTA section 919(d)(2).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 33(g)-1 clarified that remittance transfer providers are subject to the record retention requirements under § 1005.13, which apply to any person subject to the EFTA. Accordingly, remittance transfer providers would be required to retain documentation, including documentation related to error investigations, for a period of not less than two years from the date a notice of error was submitted to the provider or action was required to be taken by the provider. Similar to comment 13-1, proposed comment 33(g)-1 provided that the record retention requirements do not require a remittance transfer provider to maintain records of individual disclosures of remittance transfers that it has provided to each sender. Instead, a provider need only retain records to ensure that it can comply with a sender's request for documentation or other information relating to a particular remittance transfer, including a request for supporting documentation to enable the sender to determine whether an error exists with respect to that transfer. The Bureau did not receive any comments on proposed § 205.33(g)(2) or proposed comment 33(g)-1. The Bureau adopts proposed § 205.33(g)(2) substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(g)(2), but with an amendment to make clear that remittance transfer providers are subject to the record retention requirements under § 1005.13. The Bureau also adopts comment 33(g)-1 with amendments to conform the comment to comment 13-1 and to the changes in § 1005.33(g)(2).</analysisParagraph>

                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.33(h)(1) would have required that a remittance transfer provider be able to demonstrate that the sender provided an incorrect account number in connection with the remittance transfer.  The Bureau explained that it did not believe that this proposed condition represented a substantial change from the 2012 Final Rule, which incentivized providers to document whether the sender had provided inaccurate information in order to invoke the right to charge certain related fees in connection with a resent transaction. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) in the 2012 Final Rule.  The Bureau received no comments specific to this proposed condition.  Accordingly, proposed § 1005.33(h)(1) is adopted substantially as proposed, except that it is expanded to apply both to account numbers and recipient institution identifiers, as discussed above.  The comment is also revised to make clear that the provider must be able to demonstrate that the sender provided the incorrect account number or recipient institution identifier, language that was in proposed § 1005.33(h).</analysisParagraph>

                <title>33(h)(2)</title>
                <analysisParagraph>In the December Proposal, the Bureau noted that typically remittance transfer providers have no means to verify whether a sender provided account number for the designated recipient is accurate.  Thus, the Bureau did not propose, as a condition of the proposed exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D), that providers verify account numbers before sending a remittance transfer to an account.  However, and as noted above, the Bureau is expanding the exception to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) to include senders' mistakes regarding recipient institution identifiers, as well as mistakes regarding account numbers.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In response to the Bureau's request for comment on sender mistakes generally, some industry commenters acknowledged that, in some instances, institution identifier information provided by senders may be at least partially verifiable.  Foremost among these are BICs (sometimes referred to as SWIFT codes) and other recipient institution identifiers.  Commenters noted, however, that verification is neither ubiquitous nor perfect.  Several consumer group commenters argued, on the other hand, that the Bureau should not expand the exception to mistakes regarding recipient institution identifiers because remittance transfer providers should be able to verify such identifiers.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As a result of the Bureau's inclusion of recipient institution identifiers in the exception to the definition of error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D), the Bureau is adopting new § 1005.33(h)(2), which provides that for any instance in which the sender provided the incorrect recipient institution identifier, prior to or when sending the transfer, the provider used reasonably available means to verify that the recipient institution identifier provided by the sender corresponded to the recipient institution name provided by the sender.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As adopted, § 1005.33(h)(2) will permit remittance transfer providers to rely on the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) only in situations where no reasonable verification is possible or where reasonably available means were applied but were unable to prevent a mis-deposit that occurred because the sender provided an incorrect recipient institution identifier.  The exception does not apply to account number mistakes insofar as the Bureau continues to believe that no reasonable means to verify that an account number matches the name of the designated recipient disclosed to the sender exists today for most transfers. The Bureau will continue to monitor whether expansion of the condition is appropriate.  Furthermore, § 1005.33(h)(2) requires that the verification occur prior to or when the provider is sending the transfer because if the verification occurs later it may be too late to prevent a mis-deposit.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting new comment 33(h)-1, which explains that the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) applies only when a sender provides an incorrect recipient institution identifier, § 1005.33(h)(2) limits the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to situations where the provider used reasonably available means to verify that the recipient institution identifier provided by the sender did correspond to the recipient institution name provided by the sender.  Reasonably available means may include accessing a directory of Business Identifier Codes and verifying that the code provided by the sender matches the provided institution name, and, if possible, the specific branch or location provided by the sender.  Comment 33(h)-1 explains that providers may also rely on other commercially available databases or directories to check other recipient institution identifiers.  If reasonable verification means fail to identify that the recipient institution identifier is incorrect, the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) will apply, assuming that the provider can satisfy the other conditions in § 1005.33(h).  Similarly, if no reasonably available means exist to verify the accuracy of the recipient institution identifier, § 1005.33(h)(2) would be satisfied and thus the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) also will apply, again assuming the provider can satisfy the other conditions in § 1005.33(h).  However, where a provider does not employ reasonably available means to verify a recipient institution identifier, § 1005.33(h)(2) is not satisfied and the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) will not apply.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting this provision because upon further consideration, it concludes that if remittance transfer providers want to avail themselves of the exception to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) for mistakes regarding recipient institution identifiers, they must take reasonable steps to limit the occurrence of these mistakes.  The Bureau believes that, in many instances providers can and currently do verify the accuracy of some identifiers, and that in many other instances verification is not feasible.  For example, many providers require, and senders provide, BICs to identify recipient institutions.  Providers, or their third-party partners, typically have access to a directory in which they can match the BIC with the institution name (and possibly location), and the Bureau believes many providers (or their business partners) perform such verifications today.  The Bureau also recognizes, however, that some providers may not conduct such verification.  In other instances, precise verification that the sender has identified the proper institution may be challenging, particularly if a recipient institution has no BIC code or other type of identifier for which there is an internationally accessible directory, or if a sender has not given all the information about the recipient institution that may be reflected in a numerical identifier, such as the branch location.<footnote ref="10">See &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.swift.com/products_services/bic_and_iban_format_registration_bic_details.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
                  The Bureau believes the requirement appropriately requires verification where such mechanisms are reasonable available.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau notes that it intends to monitor the availability of other means to verify account numbers and recipient institution identifiers and it may propose to revise § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) and (h)(2) and the related commentary if such means become reasonably available.</analysisParagraph>

                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.33(h)(2) would have required a remittance transfer provider to demonstrate that the sender had notice that, if the sender provided an incorrect account number, the sender could lose the transfer amount.  Although the Bureau did not propose a specific form of notice under proposed § 1005.33(h)(2), it requested comment on whether the Bureau should specify the form of the notice and when and how such notice should be delivered.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters were largely divided on whether the Bureau should provide specific form and content instructions for the required notice.  However, no commenter objected to the basic requirement of notice, and several commenters affirmatively agreed that notice would be beneficial.  Those commenters who preferred that the Bureau specify a specific form for the required notice, including several smaller depository institutions, argued that model language provided by the Bureau would ease their compliance burden, particularly if there were a safe harbor for its use.  Those commenters who preferred the flexibility of the proposed notice provisions argued that remittance transfer providers may already provide this sort of notice in a number of different forms.  To require, or encourage through a safe harbor, specific model language or a form, these commenters contended, would cause remittance transfer providers to incur additional compliance costs as they would be required to alter existing forms and practices to match whatever the Bureau has established.  In addition, these commenters argued, providers would need additional time to comply with this final rule if they were required to use specific language to provide the proposed notice.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Several consumer group commenters argued that the proposed notice should be provided in a clear and conspicuous manner and in the same language that the rest of the transfer is conducted.  These commenters urged the Bureau to adopt a notice that comports with the clarity and language requirements of similar disclosures in other consumer statutes.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau adopts proposed § 1005.33(h)(2) with three changes as § 1005.33(h)(3).  New § 1005.33(h)(3) provides as a condition of § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) exception, a requirement that the remittance transfer provider provided notice to the sender before the sender made payment for the remittance transfer that, in the event the sender provided an incorrect account number or recipient institution identifier, the sender could lose the transfer amount.  The provision also provides that for purposes of providing the § 1005.33(h)(3) notice, § 1005.31(a)(2) applies to this notice unless the notice is given at the same time as other disclosures required by subpart B for which information is permitted to be disclosed orally or via mobile application or text message, in which case this disclosure may be given in the same medium as the other disclosures</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>This provision reflects three changes from the December Proposal:  (1) Mention of recipient institution identifiers in light of the expanded scope of § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D); (2) clarification that the notice must be provided before the sender authorizes the remittance transfer; (3) clarification that this notice may be given orally if provided along with a prepayment disclosure provided orally in accordance with § 1005.31(a)(2).<footnote ref="11">Section 1005.31(a)(2) generally requires disclosures required by subpart B of Regulation E to be in writing.  The provision makes exceptions for pre-payment disclosures, which may be provided electronically.</footnote>
                  The Bureau believes that the requirement that the notice be provided before authorization of the transfer is generally in accordance with how most providers currently provide notice today and thus should not be a significant change from existing practice. The 2013 Final Rule does not specify the form of such notice but the Bureau intends to monitor how providers implement this condition to determine whether additional specificity is appropriate.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that, pursuant to the revisions to § 1005.31(a)(1) discussed above, the notice provided pursuant to § 1005.33(h)(3), like all disclosures required by subpart B of Regulation E, in § 1005.33(h)(3) must be clear and conspicuous. <em data-original="E-03">See also</em> comment 33(a)(1)-1.  In addition, insofar as the Bureau has also amended the foreign language requirements of § 1005.31(g) to apply to all disclosures permitted by the 2013 Final Rule, the notice permitted by § 1005.33(h)(3) must be disclosed in accordance with the foreign language disclosure requirements of § 1005.33(g)(1).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As explained in the December Proposal, the Bureau's goal is to ensure that senders are informed of the risks of a mistake.  Given that many remittance transfer providers are already providing notices of this risk through various means, the Bureau wants to ensure that the practice is adopted across the remainder of the industry while minimizing the need to change existing notices if they were already sufficient for the purposes of proposed § 1005.33(h)(2).  While the Bureau understands that providing model language might make compliance easier for some providers, the Bureau believes that there are sufficient models available in providers' existing materials that it is inappropriate to delay adoption of this condition while the Bureau designs and tests appropriate model language.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>33(h)(4)</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed 33(h)(3) would have stated that for a remittance transfer provider to avail itself of the exception in proposed § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D), the provider would be required to demonstrate that the incorrect account number resulted in the deposit of the remittance transfer into a customer's account that is not the designated recipient's.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received a number of comments from industry commenters and some consumer group commenters encouraging the Bureau to eliminate this proposed condition.  These commenters stated that even if funds are not deposited into another customer's account, other forms of improper routing due to erroneous information provided by a sender could cause transferred funds to be lost or, at the very least, delayed beyond the original date of availability.  Other consumer group commenters disagreed, however, asserting that, in their opinion, remittance transfer providers typically can retrieve funds that have been misrouted unless the funds are deposited into the wrong customer's account.  These consumer group commenters opined that so long as the funds remain in an institution's control, there is generally no concern that those funds will disappear.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.33(h)(3) substantially as proposed as § 1005.33(h)(4).  The Bureau believes, as stated in the December Proposal, that when a remittance transfer is sent with the wrong account number for the designated recipient, a remittance transfer provider will be far more likely to recover the funds in situations where the funds are either rejected by another institution or otherwise reversed before they are deposited into the wrong account.  To the extent that commenters' concerns related to the delay of funds rather than their disappearance, as noted above, the Bureau declines to expand the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to cover delayed transfers rather than actual mis-deposited transfers.</analysisParagraph>

                <analysisParagraph>Proposed 33(h)(4) would have required a remittance transfer provider to promptly use reasonable efforts to recover the amount that was to be received by the designated recipient.  Proposed comment 33(h)-1 would have clarified how a provider might use reasonable efforts to recover funds.  The Bureau received several comments on the proposed provision and associated commentary.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters and consumer groups agreed with this proposed condition.  These commenters approved of its flexibility and one industry commenter noted that it was in accordance with its preexisting practice, which is to exercise best efforts to recover missing funds.  Two other commenters—a trade association and credit union—asked that the Bureau provide more explanation regarding the timeframe to meet the promptness requirement and the number of attempts to recover the funds required.  These commenters were concerned that the lack of clarity would invite litigation as to whether a particular remittance transfer provider's efforts were in fact reasonable and prompt.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Finally, one commenter asked that the Bureau clarify that a recipient institution, even if also the remittance transfer provider, not be required to debit an account that has a zero balance.  In other words, this commenter sought clarity on whether it would be required to advance funds on behalf of a customer if that customer has withdrawn the transfer amount from the customer's account.  The Bureau does not believe clarification on this point is necessary, insofar as nothing in the 2013 Final Rule states that a provider is required to advance funds that the recipient institution cannot retrieve from a customer if the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) applies.  Rather, the 2013 Final Rule has the opposite intent—the exception is intended to apply when funds cannot be retrieved.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, the Bureau is finalizing proposed § 1005.33(h)(4) substantially as proposed as § 1005.33(h)(5).  The Bureau continues to believe—as it explained in the December Proposal—that it is not appropriate to mandate specific methods that a remittance transfer provider must use to attempt to recover funds.  The Bureau believes the circumstances around individual transfers can vary greatly and that what may be reasonable in one circumstance may be unreasonable in another.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau is adopting proposed comment 33(h)-1 substantially as proposed as comment 33(h)-2 with minor revisions to improve clarity and to replace one of the proposed examples.  The Bureau is also incorporating proposed comment 33(h)-1.iii to comment 33(h)-1, which now states that § 1005.33(h)(5) requires a remittance transfer provider to use reasonable efforts to recover the amount that was to be received by the designated recipient.  Whether a provider has used reasonable efforts does not depend on whether the provider is ultimately successful in recovering the amount that was to be received by the designated recipient.  Under § 1005.33(h)(5), if the remittance transfer provider is requested to provide documentation or other supporting information in order for the pertinent institution or authority to obtain the proper authorization for the return of the incorrectly credited amount, reasonable efforts to recover the amount include timely providing any such documentation to the extent that it is available and permissible under law.  The two examples in proposed comments 33(h)-1.i and .ii are finalized as proposed as comments 33(h)-2.i. and .ii.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 33(h)-2 would have explained that the proposed condition requires a remittance transfer provider to act promptly in using reasonable efforts to recover the amount that was to be received by the designated recipient.  The Bureau received comments from industry that it should clarify when exactly reasonable efforts are considered to be prompt and also that it should create a safe harbor time period in which efforts would be deemed prompt.  The Bureau continues to believe that whether a particular provider's efforts are prompt depends on the facts and circumstances, for instance when the fact of an error is first identified.  In general, the Bureau believes a provider acts promptly where it acts before the date that the funds are expected to be made available to the recipient, but a provider may not have notice that there is a problem with the transfer that early.  Accordingly, the Bureau has adopted proposed comment 33(h)-2 as comment 33(h)-3 and is expanding its discussion.  The comment adopts the proposed language explaining that § 1005.33(h)(5) requires that a remittance transfer provider act promptly in using reasonable efforts to recover the amount that was to be received by the designated recipient and that whether a provider acts promptly to use reasonable efforts depends on the facts and circumstances.  The comment also provides an example stating that where a sender informs the provider that he or she had provided a mistaken account number before the date of availability disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii), the provider has acted promptly if it attempts to contact the institution that received the incorrect remittance transfer before the disclosed date of availability.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>33(h) Incorrect Account Number Provided by the Sender</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.33(h) contained several conditions that a remittance transfer provider would have been required to satisfy in order to benefit from the proposed exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D).  Specifically, proposed § 1005.33(h)(1) through (4) would have provided four conditions, including:  That the provider be able to demonstrate that the sender did in fact provide an incorrect account number, that the provider gave the sender notice that if the sender provided an incorrect account number that the transfer could be lost, that the incorrect account number resulted a deposit of the transfer into the wrong account, and that the provider used reasonable efforts to attempt to retrieve the mis-deposited funds.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In response to proposed § 1005.33(h), many industry commenters sought more specificity in the conditions, especially with respect to the form of notice required to inform senders that the transfer amount could be lost, what would satisfy as a reasonable effort to retrieve lost funds, and the timeframe in which such efforts would be deemed prompt.  Other industry participants, however, supported the generality in the proposed conditions because the commenters believed that the conditions provided flexibility and accommodated existing practice.  In addition, some industry commenters expressed concern with the proposed condition that funds actually be mis-deposited into the wrong account for the proposed exception to apply.  These commenters argued that often it is difficult for remittance transfer providers to know whether funds have in fact been mis-deposited.  The Bureau has considered these comments and is finalizing the rule with five conditions in § 1005.33(h)(1) through (5), each of which is discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Generally speaking, the Bureau believes that the conditions set forth in § 1005.33(h) are consistent with industry best practices today and will provide further incentive to continue improving safeguards against mis-deposit over time.  Where a remittance transfer is deposited into the wrong account today, the Bureau believes that many, if not most, providers already attempt to recover the principal amount of the transfer.  However, because providers have reported that they often do not have direct relationships with receiving institutions, and that in some instances those institutions may be unresponsive to requests for assistance, providers may face difficulties in recovering funds from the wrong account.  The Bureau believes that, in many instances, to reverse these transactions requires the accountholder to authorize a debit from the account and, thus, the lack of this authority may prohibit a recipient institution from debiting the account in the amount of the incorrect deposit absent an authorization.  Relatedly, a provider in the United States may be able to do little to assist the foreign institution in its attempt to persuade its accountholder to provide debit authorization due to the lack of privity between the provider and the recipient institution or the accountholder.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Thus, the 2013 Final Rule strikes an appropriate balance by limiting the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to circumstances of actual mis-deposits and by requiring reasonable verification methods, without holding remittance transfer providers responsible for circumstances beyond their control.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>Section 1005.33 Procedures for Resolving Errors</title>
            <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(d) addresses procedures for resolving errors in connection with remittance transfers, and allows a sender to provide notice of an error within 180 days of the promised date of delivery of a remittance transfer. The sender's notice triggers a remittance transfer provider's duty to investigate the claim and correct any error within 90 days of receiving the notice. The statue generally does not define what types of transfers and inquiries constitute errors and gives the Bureau the authority to define “error.” The Board proposed § 205.33 to implement the new error resolution requirements for remittance transfers that adapted many of the same error resolution procedures that currently apply to a financial institution under § 1005.11. The Bureau adopts proposed § 205.33 as § 1005.33 with several changes based on recommendations from commenters, as discussed in detail below.</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisParagraph>As noted above, consumers may be permitted to schedule a series of preauthorized remittance transfers in which the transfer amount is fixed in a currency other than that in which the transfer is funded. Thus, § 1005.32(b)(2)(i) permits estimates to be provided for, among other things, the total amount of the transfer. In light of this new provision, a revision to § 1005.33(a)(1)(i) is necessary to clarify that disclosing an estimate of the total amount of the transfer in this case would not result in an error.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Under the February Final Rule, § 1005.33(a)(1)(i) states than “error” means an incorrect amount paid by a sender in connection with a remittance transfer. Comment 33(a)-1 explains that § 1005.33(a)(1)(i) covers circumstances in which a sender pays an amount that differs from the total amount of the transaction, including fees imposed in connection with the transfer, stated in the receipt or combined disclosure provided under § 1005.31(b)(2) or (3).</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is revising this provision to exempt from the definition of error estimates of the total amount of the transfer provided in accordance with the new exception in § 1005.32(b)(2). This exception allows for, among other things, an estimate of the amount to be transferred if, at the time the sender schedules the transfer, the remittance transfer provider agrees to a sender's request to fix the amount to be transferred in the currency in which the remittance transfer will be received and not the currency in which it is funded. When the amount to be transferred is estimated under this section, the provider is also permitted to estimate the total amount of the transaction (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the amount to be paid by the sender).</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Thus, as revised, § 1005.33(a)(1)(i) states that the term error means an incorrect amount paid by a sender in connection with a remittance transfer, unless the disclosure stated an estimate of the amount paid by a sender in accordance with § 1005.32(b)(2) and the difference results from application of the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes, rather than any estimated amount. As discussed in detail below, when a remittance transfer provider estimates of the total amount of the transfer in a receipt provided at least five or more business days before the date of transfer (<em data-original="E-03">see</em> § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) and (a)(2)(i)), the provider must also send a receipt without the estimate after the transfer (<em data-original="E-03">see</em> § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) and (a)(2)(ii)). Thus, the sender will still receive a receipt with the actual amount the sender paid for the transfer and can still assert an error based on the disclosure of the amount paid in that receipt.</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(d) provides that remittance transfer providers shall investigate and resolve errors where a sender provides a notice of an error within 180 days of the promised date of delivery of a remittance transfer.  The statute generally does not define what types of transfers and inquiries constitute errors, but rather gives the Bureau broad authority to set standards for remittance transfer providers with respect to error resolution relating to remittance transfers.  The 2012 Final Rule implements such error resolution standards in § 1005.33.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Under § 1005.33, as adopted in the 2012 Final Rule, an error occurs in various situations including when the remittance transfer is not made available to a designated recipient by the date of availability stated in the disclosure provided by § 1005.31(b)(2) or (3) for the remittance transfer.  Such an error may result from a sender's provision of an incorrect account or routing number to a remittance transfer provider.  Industry expressed concern after the February Final Rule was published about the remedies available when a sender provides an incorrect account number to the provider.  Providers have stated that in some cases, as a result of such errors, remittance transfers may be deposited into the wrong account and, despite reasonable efforts by the provider, cannot be recovered.  Under § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii) of the 2012 Final Rule, a provider is obligated to resend to the designated recipient or refund to the sender the total amount of the remittance transfer regardless of whether it can recover the funds.  Industry has noted that this problem is of particular concern with respect to transfers of large sums, particularly for smaller institutions that might have more difficulty bearing the loss of the entire transfer amount.  In addition, providers have expressed concern that the remedy provisions of the 2012 Final Rule create a potential for fraud, despite an exception that excludes transfers with fraudulent intent from the definition of error. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C).</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In response to these concerns, in the December Proposal the Bureau proposed a new exception to the definition of error in § 1005.33.  The exception set forth in proposed § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) would have excluded from the definition of error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) the sender having given the remittance transfer provider an incorrect account number, provided the provider met certain specified conditions.  The Bureau also proposed several other changes to the error resolution procedures in § 1005.33 to address questions of how remittance transfer providers should provide remedies to senders for errors that occurred because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Based on comments received, the Bureau is adopting the proposed exception and is further revising these procedures as detailed below.  The Bureau is also adopting conforming changes to the error resolution procedures to reflect revisions to the disclosure requirements concerning non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the provider as well as making several technical, non-substantive changes.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>31(b)(1)(viii) Statements That Non-Covered Third-Party Fees or Taxes Collected on the Remittance Transfer by a Person Other Than the Provider May Apply</title>
            <analysisParagraph>In the December Proposal, the Bureau solicited comment on methods to reduce the burden of required disclosures of fees and taxes imposed on remittance transfers by persons other than the providers and alternative disclosures that could be provided.  Several industry and consumer group commenters suggested that in place of requiring exact or estimated disclosures of recipient institution fees or foreign taxes, the Bureau could require a statement within the disclosure forms alerting senders that the total amount received may be reduced by recipient institution fees or foreign taxes.  These commenters contended that such a disclosure would ensure that senders are aware of the potential for further reductions in the disclosed amount received, due to fees or taxes that are not disclosed, and would encourage senders and recipients to investigate the fees associated with a transfer to the recipient's financial institution, as compared to those associated with other mechanisms for sending a remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Although the Bureau is eliminating the requirement to calculate and disclose non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider, the Bureau strongly believes that it is nonetheless important to inform senders when fees and taxes that are not disclosed may apply to the remittance transfer.  Accordingly, to further the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes that it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to add § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii), which requires that a provider include, as applicable, a statement indicating that non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider may apply to the remittance transfer and result in the designated recipient receiving less than the amount disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii).  Moreover, under this paragraph, a provider may, but is not required to, disclose any applicable non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider using the language set for in Model Forms A-30(b)-(d) of Appendix A to this part or substantially similar language.  Any such figures must be disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be received, using the language set forth in Model Forms A-30(b) through (d) of Appendix A to this part, as appropriate, or substantially similar language.  The exchange rate used to calculate any disclosed non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider is the exchange rate used in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by § 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate.  Although new § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) makes the disclosure of the amount of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the provider optional, the Bureau believes that providers may be motivated to collect and disclose such information voluntarily, in the interest of providing high levels of customer service to senders and to better compete for remittance business against other providers.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>New comment 31(b)(1)(viii)-1 clarifies that if non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider apply to a particular remittance transfer, or if a provider does not know if such fees or taxes may apply to a particular remittance transfer, § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) requires the provider to include the disclaimer with respect to such fees and taxes.  Comment 31(b)(1)(viii)-1 additionally clarifies that required disclosures under § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) may only be provided to the extent applicable.  For example, if the designated recipient's institution is an agent of the provider and thus, non-covered third-party fees cannot apply to the transfer, the provider must disclose all fees imposed on the remittance transfer and may not provide the disclaimer regarding non-covered third-party fees.  In this scenario, the commentary clarifies, the provider may only provide the disclaimer regarding taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, as applicable.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>New comment 31(b)(1)(viii)-2 explains that § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) permits a provider to disclose the amount of any non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider.  For example, when a remittance transfer provider knows that the designated recipient's institution imposes a fee or that a foreign tax will apply, the provider may choose to disclose the relevant fee or tax as part of the information disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii).  The comment also notes that § 1005.32(b)(3) permits the provider to disclose estimated amounts of such taxes and fees, provided any estimates are based on reasonable source of information. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 32(b)(3)-1.  It further provides that where the provider chooses, at its option, to disclose the amounts of the relevant recipient institution fee or tax as part of the information disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii), the provider must not include that fee or tax in the amounts disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) or (b)(1)(vii).</analysisParagraph>

              <title>32(a) Temporary Exception for Insured Institutions</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.32(a)(1) provided a temporary exception for remittance transfer providers, which permits them to disclose estimates of the exchange rate, the transfer amount, other fees and taxes, and total to recipient if: (i) A remittance transfer provider cannot determine exact amounts for reasons beyond its control; (ii) a remittance transfer provider is an insured institution; and (iii) the remittance transfer is sent from the sender's account with the insured institution.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Most industry commenters generally supported permitting insured institutions to disclose estimates. For example, one commenter stated that restricting the use of estimates could discourage innovation and increase costs to offset risk. Consumer group commenters generally supported the proposed use of estimates but requested that the temporary exception not be extended. Some industry commenters, however, objected to permitting estimates to be disclosed because estimates could lead to inaccurate or misleading disclosures which would disservice consumers.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes permitting estimates, as provided by the temporary exception, is consistent with the statutory language and purpose of EFTA section 919(a)(4). The statute specifically provides that, subject to the Bureau's rules, an insured institution may use a reasonably accurate estimate of the amount of currency received under certain circumstances. Section 1005.32(a)(1) implements the temporary exception generally as proposed, as discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(4) only addresses estimates for the amount of currency that will be received by a designated recipient. Nonetheless, proposed § 205.32(a)(1) also permitted disclosure of an estimate for the exchange rate, the transfer amount in the currency made available to the designated recipient, the fees imposed by intermediaries in the transmittal route, and taxes imposed in the recipient country that are a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient to the extent those amounts are not known for reasons beyond the insured institution's control. In the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the Board stated its belief that, by permitting an estimate of the amount that will be received, Congress must have intended to permit estimates of the components that determine that amount. The inability to determine the exact amount of one or more of these additional items is the reason why the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient must be estimated. Furthermore, the Board stated that permitting estimates of these additional items would help consumers to understand why the amount of currency to be received is displayed as an estimate. The Bureau did not receive any comments on this aspect of the proposal. The Bureau concurs with the Board's reasoning, and believes that to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and facilitate compliance, it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to allow an estimate of the exchange rate, transfer amount, and other fees and taxes disclosures in § 1005.32(a)(1). To not exercise the Bureau's authority in this way would render the statutory exemption essentially meaningless, and the Bureau believes that result could not be intended by the statutory exemption for estimating the amount of currency received.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In the proposed rule, the Board also stated that EFTA section 919(a)(4) only addresses the use of an estimate of the amount of foreign currency that will be received by a designated recipient. However, the proposed rule permitted an estimate of the currency that will be received, whether it is in U.S. dollars or foreign currency. The Bureau understands that senders may send remittance transfers to be paid to the designated recipient in U.S. dollars. When an insured institution sends a remittance transfer via international wire transfer, fees are sometimes deducted by intermediary institutions in the transmittal route with which the sending institution has no correspondent relationship. Although the insured institution may not know the total amount of these fees in advance, it must disclose them to the sender under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). The amount that will be received by the designated recipient, whether that currency is U.S. dollars or foreign currency, will be an estimate if fees imposed by intermediaries are disclosed as estimates. Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of EFTA and to facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to allow an estimate of the amount of currency that will be received, even if that currency is in U.S. dollars.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The proposed commentary to § 205.32(a)(1) provided further guidance on the temporary exception. Specifically, proposed comment 32(a)(1)-1 clarified that an insured institution cannot determine exact amounts “for reasons beyond its control” when: (i) The exchange rate required to be disclosed under proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(iv) is set by a person with which the insured institution has no correspondent relationship after the insured institution sends the remittance transfer; or (ii) fees required to be disclosed under proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(vi) are imposed by intermediary institutions along the transmittal route and the insured institution has no correspondent relationship with those institutions.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter requested clarification regarding instances when an insured institution has a correspondent relationship but may not control or know what exchange rate the correspondent will use. For example, a remittance transfer provider may send a remittance transfer in U.S. dollars and a correspondent institution may be responsible for exchanging to the currency in which funds will be received. Similarly, other industry commenters noted that an insured institution may not know the taxes or fees imposed by a correspondent institution. Although the Bureau acknowledges that some insured institutions currently may not receive certain exchange rate, tax, or fee information from a correspondent institution, the Bureau believes that such information can be obtained through contractual arrangements in a correspondent relationship. The Bureau notes that the statutory exception is only available for circumstances beyond remittance transfer providers' control, and the Bureau believes that adjusting contractual arrangements with correspondent banks to provide for better information relay is within the control of remittance transfer providers. Accordingly, comment 32(a)(1)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed with clarifying revisions and an example.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 32(a)(1)-2 provided examples of scenarios that qualify for the temporary exception. The Bureau did not receive significant comment on the examples provided in the proposed comment. Comment 32(a)(1)-2 is adopted substantially as proposed with clarifying revisions. Comment 32(a)(1)-2.i. clarifies that an insured institution cannot determine the exact exchange rate to disclose for an international wire transfer if the insured institution does not set the exchange rate, and the rate is set when the funds are deposited into the recipient's account by the designated recipient's institution with which the insured institution does not have a correspondent relationship. The insured institution will not know the exchange rate that the recipient institution will apply when the funds are deposited into the recipient's account. Comment 32(a)(1)-2.ii. provides that an insured institution cannot determine the exact fees to disclose under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) if an intermediary institution or the designated recipient's institution, with which the insured institution does not have a correspondent relationship, imposes a transfer or conversion fee. Finally, comment 32(a)(1)-2.iii. states that an insured institution cannot determine the exact taxes to disclose under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) if the insured institution cannot determine the applicable exchange rate or other fees, as described in proposed comments 32(a)(1)-2.i. and 32(a)(1)-2.ii., and the recipient country imposes a tax that is a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient, less any other fees.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 32(a)(1)-3 provided several examples of when an insured institution would not qualify for the exception in proposed § 205.32(a). In each case, the insured institution could determine the exact amount for the relevant disclosure. The proposed examples illustrated that if an insured institution can determine the exact exchange rate, fees, and taxes required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) and (vi), it can determine the exact amounts to be derived from calculations involving them.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive significant comment on the proposed provision, which is adopted substantially as proposed. Comment 32(a)(1)-3.i. explains that an insured institution can determine the exact exchange rate required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) if it converts the funds into the local currency to be received by the designated recipient using an exchange rate that it sets. Comment 32(a)(1)-3.ii. states that an insured institution can determine the exact fees required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) if it has negotiated specific fees with a correspondent institution, and the correspondent institution is the only institution in the transmittal route to the designated recipient's institution, which itself does not impose fees. Finally, comment 32(a)(1)-3.iii. clarifies that an insured institution can determine the exact taxes required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) if the recipient country imposes a tax that is a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient, less any other fees, and the insured institution can determine the exact amount of the applicable exchange rate and other fees. Similarly, the insured institution can determine these taxes if the recipient country imposes a specific sum tax that is not tied to the amount transferred.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.32(a)(2) provided that the temporary exception expires on July 20, 2015, consistent with the five-year term set forth in EFTA section 919(a)(4)(B). EFTA section 919(a)(4)(B) gives the Bureau authority to extend the application of the temporary exception to July 21, 2020, if it determines that termination of the exception would negatively affect the ability of insured institutions to send remittances to foreign countries. The Bureau understands that this exception was intended to avoid an immediate disruption of remittance transfer services by insured institutions using international wire transfers. The exception gives these institutions time to reach agreements and modify systems to provide accurate disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters argued that the temporary exception for insured institutions should be made permanent, or in the alternative, be extended to ten years after the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, which is July 21, 2020. The OCC also noted the ability of the Bureau to extend the temporary exception for insured institutions to ten years after the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act and urged the Bureau to consider the impact of these standards on community banks. In contrast, consumer groups supported the five-year sunset of the temporary exception and requested that the Bureau indicate that the temporary exception will not be extended.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that the sunset of the temporary exception is statutory. In addition, the Bureau believes that there is no basis at this time to assess whether allowing the exception to expire in accordance with the statute would have negative effects where the final rule is just now being issued, initial implementation is expected to take a year, and the market has not yet had a chance to respond to the regulatory requirements. Therefore, the Bureau declines to extend the temporary exception at this time. Finally, the Bureau notes that in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, proposed § 205.32(a)(2) stated July 20, 2015 as the sunset date for the temporary exception provided in § 205.32(a)(1). The final rule includes a technical edit to clarify that the sunset date for the temporary exception is July 21, 2015 in order to avoid potential confusion and promote consistency among references to the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. Accordingly, proposed § 205.32(a)(2) is adopted as proposed in renumbered § 1005.32(a)(2), with a technical edit to reflect the change in date to July 21, 2015.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>For purposes of the temporary exception, proposed § 205.32(a)(3) provided that the term “insured institution” included insured depository institutions as defined in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813) and insured credit unions as defined in section 101 of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1752). Industry commenters generally requested clarification on the application of the temporary exception to uninsured institutions. In particular, these commenters requested that the temporary exception should also include uninsured depository institutions, such as certain U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks. They also argued that uninsured U.S. branches of foreign banks also process retail international wire transfers in the same manner as insured institutions, and would face similar compliance challenges as other insured institutions.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that including uninsured U.S. branches of foreign banks in the term “insured institution” is consistent with the purposes of the statutory exception and will prevent disruption in remittance transfer services. The Bureau notes that section 3(c)(3) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that for certain purposes, the term “insured depository institution” includes any uninsured U.S. branch or agency of a foreign bank or a commercial lending company owned or controlled by a foreign bank. Therefore, the Bureau believes including uninsured U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks in the term “insured institution” is consistent with the statutory exception and section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Accordingly, proposed § 205.32(a)(3) is adopted with clarification in renumbered § 1005.32(a)(3).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Similarly, one commenter argued that registered broker-dealers should be covered by the temporary exception because they may process international wire transfers. However, as discussed above, the Bureau is clarifying that, for the purposes of this rule, fund transfers in connection with securities transactions are not remittance transfers. Therefore, the Bureau believes further clarification in the rule with respect to this comment is not necessary.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>32(b)(3) Estimates for Non-Covered Third-Party Fees and Taxes Collected by a Person Other Than the Provider</title>
                <analysisParagraph>As described above, the Bureau is eliminating the requirement to disclose certain recipient institution fees and taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider and to include such amounts in the amount received, required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) and (b)(2)(i).  Nevertheless, the Bureau believes that where the remittance transfer provider knows or can reasonably estimate any applicable non-covered third-party fee or tax collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider and elects to disclose one or both of such amounts, senders are likely to benefit from more accurate and informative disclosures.  Consequently, § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) permits a provider to disclose any applicable non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider applicable to a remittance transfer in conjunction with the required disclaimers.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In order to encourage the optional disclosure of such information, § 1005.32(b)(3) of the 2013 Final Rule permits remittance transfer providers latitude to estimate any applicable non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider.  Such estimates may be based on reasonable sources of information.  The Bureau acknowledges that permitting providers to estimate such amounts may result in providers providing disclosures that may not reflect the actual charge by individual recipient institutions or the taxes levied upon such transfers.  Nonetheless, the Bureau believes that permitting a reasonable approximation of the amount of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on the remittance transfer by persons other than the remittance transfer provider that could be assessed based on reasonable sources would provide senders valuable information about the amount to be received while also allowing the provider sufficient flexibility to disclose such information.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>New comment 32(b)(3)-1 further notes that reasonable sources of information may include, for example: Information obtained from recent transfers to the same institution or the same country or region; fee schedules from the recipient institution; fee schedules from the recipient institution's competitors; surveys of recipient institution fees in the same country or region as the recipient institution; information provided or surveys of recipient institutions' regulators or taxing authorities; commercially or publicly available databases, services or sources; and information or resources developed by international nongovernmental organizations or intergovernmental organizations.

Conforming changes have also been made to comments 32(a)(1)-1, (a)(1)-2.ii, 32(a)(1)-3.ii, and 32(b)(2)-1 so that these comments and related headings, as finalized, use the term “covered third-party fees” rather than “other fees.”</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>In § 1005.32(c)(3)(ii), however, the Bureau notes that it has retained a reference to fees imposed by both the intermediary and the final recipient's institution.

              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.32(b) contained the permanent exception set forth in EFTA section 919(c). Under EFTA section 919(c), if the Bureau determines that a recipient nation does not legally allow, or the method by which transactions are made to the recipient country do not allow, a remittance transfer provider to know the amount of currency that will be received, the Bureau may issue rules to permit the remittance transfer provider to provide a reasonably accurate estimate. The Board's proposal specifically noted that there is at least one recipient country where a particular method of remittances do not allow remittance transfer providers to know the amount of currency that will be received.<footnote ref="80">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 76 FR 29923.</footnote></analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In light of that determination, the proposed rule allowed estimates to be provided for amounts required to be disclosed under proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(iv) through (vii) for transfers to certain countries. Like the temporary exception in EFTA section 919(a)(4), the permanent exception in EFTA section 919(c) only addresses estimates for the amount of currency that will be received by a designated recipient. For the reasons described above with respect to the temporary exception, proposed § 205.32(b) also permitted disclosure of estimates for the exchange rate, the transfer amount in the currency made available to the designated recipient, and taxes imposed in the recipient country that are a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient. The Bureau did not receive any comments on this aspect of the proposal. For the reasons set forth above with regard to the temporary exception and to effectuate the purposes of EFTA and facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to adopt this proposed permanent exception in § 1005.32(b).</analysisParagraph>

                <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters raised concerns about whether remittance transfer providers have the resources to determine whether this exception applies. Consumer group commenters argued that the statute requires the Bureau to determine which recipient countries qualify for the permanent exception, rather than leaving the determination to individual market participants. Both industry and consumer group commenters recommended that the Bureau maintain a list of countries or a database, updated annually, to which the permanent exception based on the laws of a recipient country would apply.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that it is appropriate for remittance transfer providers to identify and comply with a recipient country's currency laws. The Bureau also believes that remittance transfer providers and their correspondents generally are able to obtain this information because they are engaged in the business of remittance transfers to recipient countries and must comply with any applicable law that prevents the remittance transfer provider from determining exchange rates or exact amounts. Nonetheless, in response to comments received and upon further consideration, the Bureau is revising proposed § 205.32(b) to facilitate compliance by providing a safe harbor list of countries which qualify for the permanent exception.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, the Bureau is renumbering proposed § 205.32(b) as § 1005.32(b)(1) and adopting new § 1005.32(b)(2) to provide a safe harbor. New § 1005.32(b)(2) states that a remittance transfer provider may rely on the list of countries published by the Bureau to determine whether estimates may be provided under the permanent exception, unless the provider has information that a country's laws or the method by which transactions are conducted in that country permits a determination of the exact disclosure amount.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau is adopting commentary on new § 1005.32(b)(2). New comment 32(b)-5 provides guidance on the safe harbor list published by the Bureau. New comment 32(b)-6 provides further guidance on reliance on the Bureau-provided list of countries that qualify for the permanent exception. New comment 32(b)-7 addresses circumstance where there is a change in laws of the recipient country.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 32(b)(1)-1 clarified that the “laws of the recipient country” do not permit a remittance transfer provider to determine exact amounts when a law or regulation of the recipient country requires the person making funds directly available to the designated recipient to apply an exchange rate that is: (i) Set by the government of the recipient country after the remittance transfer provider sends the remittance transfer; or (ii) set when the designated recipient chooses to claim the funds. Comment 32(b)(1)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed, but renumbered as comment 32(b)-1 for organizational purposes.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>One commenter requested clarification about whether proposed comment 32(b)(1)-1 covered instances where the local currency is thinly traded and the laws of a recipient country require an authorized dealer to set the exchange rate when the remittance transfer is received. The Bureau believes that the proposed comment already covers such circumstances because the government of the recipient country, acting through an authorized dealer, sets the exchange rate after the remittance transfer has been sent. In addition, the transfer may also qualify for the permanent exception if the exchange rate is required by law to be set by the authorized dealer when the recipient claims the funds.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed comments 32(b)(1)-2.i. and 32(b)(1)-2.ii. provided examples illustrating the application of the exception. Proposed comment 32(b)(1)-2.i. explained that the laws of the recipient country do not permit a remittance transfer provider to determine the exact exchange rate required to be disclosed under proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(iv) (adopted as § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) above) when, for example, the government of the recipient country sets the exchange rate daily and the funds are made available to the designated recipient in the local currency the day after the remittance transfer provider sends the remittance transfer. Under such circumstances, an estimate for the exchange rate would be permitted because the remittance transfer provider cannot determine a rate that a foreign government has yet to set.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In contrast, proposed comment 32(b)(1)-2.ii. explained that the laws of the recipient country permit a remittance transfer provider to determine the exact exchange rate required to be disclosed under proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(iv) (adopted as § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) above) if, for example, the government of the recipient country ties the value of its currency to the U.S. dollar.

                <title>32(b)(1)(ii) Method by Which Transactions are Made in the Recipient Country</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.32(b)(2) allowed estimates to be provided for the exchange rate, transfer amount, other fees and taxes, and total to recipient disclosures (adopted as § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) through (vii) above), if a remittance transfer provider cannot determine exact amounts because the method by which transactions are made in the recipient country does not permit such a determination.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Based on the Board's outreach and interpretation of the statute, the Board stated its belief that the exception for methods by which transactions are made in the recipient country under proposed § 205.32(b)(2) was intended to permit estimates for certain international ACH transactions. Specifically, the Board interpreted the exception under § 205.32(b)(2) to apply to remittances sent via international ACH on terms negotiated by the government of the United States and the government of a recipient country where the exchange rate is set after the transfer is sent. Accordingly, proposed comment 32(b)(2)-1 stated that the “method by which transactions are made in the recipient country” does not permit a remittance transfer provider to determine exact amounts when transactions are sent via international ACH on terms negotiated between the United States government and the recipient country's government, under which the exchange rate is set by the recipient country's central bank after the provider sends the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters argued that the Bureau should adopt a broader reading of the statute, and that international wire transfers should be covered by the permanent exception. These commenters argued that international wire transfers are a method by which transactions are made in a recipient country that does not allow the remittance transfer provider to know the amount of currency that will be received by a designated recipient and should thus qualify for the permanent exception. One industry commenter stated that the permanent exception is helpful for certain international ACH transactions; however, the benefit is limited by the number of recipient countries that participate in the Federal Reserve System's FedGlobal ACH program. Other industry commenters requested that all international ACH transfers be covered by the permanent exception and that the exception should not be limited to those that are sent on terms negotiated between the United States government and the recipient country's government. These commenters noted that all cross-border ACH transfers, regardless of how the exchange rate is set, are subject to similar difficulties as certain international ACH transfers that qualify for the permanent exception. Consumer group commenters supported the proposal's application of the permanent exception based on the method to certain international ACH transfers.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In each case, the Bureau agrees with the Board's interpretation. The Bureau believes that extending the permanent exception to international wire transfers and all international ACH transactions would be inconsistent with the statutory language and purpose of the provision, which specifically refers to methods of transfer <em data-original="E-03">in a recipient country</em> (emphasis added). The Bureau must give meaning to this phrase, and does not believe that the interpretation urged by commenters is dependent on a method of transfer in a particular country.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe that the permanent exception in EFTA section 919(c) applies to international wire transfers because wire transfers are not a method that is particular to a specific country or group of countries. Rather, compliance challenges may arise due to the international wire transfer business model, which is based on a chain of correspondents and two-party contractual relationships.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In addition, the application of the permanent exception to international wire transfers and ACH transactions generally would make the temporary exception superfluous. As discussed above, the statute is broad in scope, specifically covering transactions that are account-based and that are not electronic fund transfers, and therefore, covers open network transactions. Further, as described above with regard to the temporary exception, the statute specifically permits the use of estimates by depository institutions and credit unions for certain account-based transactions. If all open network transactions were included in the permanent exception, there would be no need for the temporary exception because nearly all, if not all, the types of transfers that qualify for the temporary exception would be covered by the permanent exception. The Bureau does not believe the temporary exception is superfluous. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to extend the permanent exception to these transactions.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>One commenter argued that the permanent exception for method of transfer should also include instances when the remittance transfer provider and the sender agree to have the exchange rate set at some point in the future (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> floating rate products). As with wire transfers, such an agreement is not a method by which a transaction is made that is particular to a specific country or group of countries. Therefore, the Bureau also believes that this circumstance would not be eligible for the permanent exception. The Bureau notes, however, that the remittance transfer provider that is party to such an agreement may provide estimates of the exchange rate if the remittance transfer provider qualifies for the temporary exception in § 1005.32(a). For the reasons discussed above, proposed § 205.32(b)(2) is adopted as proposed in renumbered § 1005.32(b)(1)(ii). Proposed comment 32(b)(2)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed with clarifying revision, but renumbered as comment 32(b)-3 for organizational purposes.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 32(b)(2)-2 provided examples illustrating the application of the permanent exception. The comment is adopted substantially as proposed, but renumbered as comment 32(b)-4 for organizational purposes. Comment 32(b)-4.i. provides an example of when a remittance transfer would qualify for the exception. The Bureau notes that some comments received indicate that there may be confusion as to the application of the permanent exception provided in § 1005.32(b)(1)(ii) to any transfer sent via international ACH. However, comment 32(b)-4.i. explains that a transfer would only qualify for the exception when sent via international ACH on terms negotiated between the United States government and the recipient country's government, under which the exchange rate is a rate set by the recipient country's central bank or other governmental authority on the business day after the provider has sent the remittance transfer. Under such circumstances, the provider cannot determine the exact exchange rate required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv). Thus, remittance transfers sent via Directo a México currently would qualify for the permanent exception in § 1005.32(b)(1)(ii). Accordingly, proposed comment 32(b)-4.i. is adopted substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed comments 32(b)(2)-2.ii. and -2.iii. provided examples of when a remittance transfer would not qualify for the permanent exception in § 1005.32(b)(1)(ii). The Bureau did not receive significant comment on the proposed comments, which are adopted substantially as proposed, with technical and clarifying edits, in renumbered comments 32(b)-4.ii. and 32(b)-4.iii. Comment 32(b)-4.ii. explains that a remittance transfer provider is not permitted to provide estimates under the permanent exception if it sends a remittance transfer via international ACH on terms negotiated between the United States government and a private-sector entity in the recipient country, under which the exchange rate is set by the institution acting as the entry point to the recipient country's payments system on the next business day. In this case, transactions are made using a method negotiated between the United States and a private entity. Nonetheless, remittance transfers sent using such a method may qualify for the temporary exception in § 1005.32(a). Comment 32(b)-4.iii. explains that a remittance transfer provider does not qualify for the permanent exception if, for example, it sends transfers via international ACH on terms negotiated between the United States government and the recipient country's government, under which the exchange rate is set by the recipient country's central bank or other governmental authority before the sender requests a transfer. In such a case, the remittance transfer provider can determine the exchange rate required to be disclosed.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>32(c) Bases for Estimates</title>
              <analysisParagraph>If a remittance transfer qualifies for either the temporary exception in EFTA section 919(a)(4) or the permanent exception in EFTA section 919(c), the statute permits the provider to disclose a reasonably accurate estimate to the sender. Proposed § 205.32(c) stated that estimates provided pursuant to the exceptions in proposed § 205.32(a) and (b) (adopted as § 1005.32(a) and (b) above) must be based on an approach listed in the regulation for the required disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.32(c) further stated that if a remittance transfer provider bases an estimate on an approach that is not listed, the provider complies with proposed § 205.32(c) so long as the designated recipient receives the same, or greater, amount of currency that it would have received had the estimate been based on a listed approach. Thus, use of an approach other than one listed in the proposed rule is compliant with the regulation if the sender is not harmed by such use.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters generally requested greater flexibility in estimating exchange rates and fees. For example, commenters recommended less prescriptive approaches, such as permitting remittance transfer providers to base estimates on reasonably available information, adopting a reasonably accurate standard, or adopting a safe harbor for good faith estimates within a specified tolerance. The Bureau generally concurs with the Board's reasoning in the May 2011 Proposed Rule that providing a list of approaches for calculating estimates would be more helpful to remittance transfer providers and consumers than a less specific standard for calculating estimates. The Bureau believes that requiring estimates be provided based on an approach listed in the regulation will facilitate compliance with the final rule. However, in response to comments received, the Bureau is clarifying proposed § 205.32(c). The safe harbor in proposed § 205.32(c) was intended to provide greater flexibility and to facilitate compliance for remittance transfer providers that may base an estimate on an approach that is not listed in the rule. However, the Bureau notes that under the proposal, the provider would have been required to compare any estimate based on its own approach with an estimate based on a listed approach in order to determine whether the sender would be harmed by such use. The Bureau believes that this comparison would unnecessarily increase the burden of using an unlisted approach and render the safe harbor meaningless. Therefore, the Bureau revises proposed § 205.32(c) to state that if a provider bases an estimate on an approach not listed in the rule, the provider is deemed to be in compliance with the rule so long as the designated recipient receives the same, or greater, amount of funds than the remittance transfer provider disclosed as required under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii). The Bureau believes that this clarification also ensures that the sender is not harmed because the amount of funds received by the designated recipient will be the same or greater than the estimated total amount received as required to be disclosed under § 1005.32(b)(1)(vii). Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 205.32(c) as § 1005.32(c) with amendment.</analysisParagraph>

The final rule adopts the proposed rule as § 1005.32(c)(1), with modifications and additional commentary to address issues raised in comments.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The approach in proposed § 205.32(c)(1)(i) stated that for remittance transfers qualifying for the § 1005.32(b)(1)(ii) exception, the estimate must be based on the most recent exchange rate set by the recipient country's central bank and reported by a Federal Reserve Bank. Proposed comment 32(c)(1)(i)-1 clarified that if the exchange rate for a remittance transfer sent via international ACH that qualifies for the proposed § 205.32(b)(2) exception is set the following business day, the most recent exchange rate available for a transfer will be the exchange rate set for the day that the disclosure is provided, <em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the current business day's exchange rate. Consumer group commenters generally supported proposed § 205.32(c)(1)(i) and its commentary. Other commenters believed that the application of the proposed § 205.32(b)(2) exception should be broadened generally, as discussed above. Accordingly, proposed § 205.32(c)(1)(i) is adopted as proposed in renumbered § 1005.32(c)(1)(i). Comment 32(c)(1)(i)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed, but renumbered as comment 32(c)(1)-1 for organizational purposes.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The approach in proposed § 205.32(c)(1)(ii) provided that, for other transfers, the estimate must be based on the most recent publicly available wholesale exchange rate. Industry commenters argued that the wholesale interbank exchange rate would not be the rate actually applied to a consumer's remittance transfer, so using the wholesale exchange rate as an estimate would be misleading to consumers. For instance, basing an estimate on only the wholesale rate could consistently overestimate the amount of currency received by a recipient because the wholesale rate does not account for any spread applied to the rate for a sender's remittance transfer to a particular country. One commenter noted that estimates of exchange rates may be based on information from foreign exchange dealers as well as rates available in the marketplace.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Based on comments received and upon further analysis, the Bureau is adopting a revised basis for estimates in renumbered § 1005.32(c)(1)(ii) and its related commentary to address concerns regarding the proposed use of a wholesale exchange rate. Specifically, § 1005.32(c)(1)(ii) provides that, in disclosing the exchange rate as required under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), an estimate must be based on the most recent publicly available wholesale rate and, if applicable, the spread typically applied to such a rate by the remittance transfer provider or its correspondent to the wholesale rate for remittance transfers for a particular currency. The Bureau believes the revised subsection will result in an estimated exchange rate that better approximates the “retail” rate that will apply to a sender's remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>New comment 32(c)(1)-3 provides guidance on applying any spread to the estimate of an exchange rate based on the wholesale exchange rate. If a remittance transfer provider uses the most recent wholesale exchange rate as a basis for an estimate of an exchange rate, the exchange rate estimate must also reflect any spread that is typically applied to such a rate for remittance transfers for a particular currency. For example, assume a remittance transfer provider (or its correspondent) typically applies a spread, such as a fixed percentage, to a wholesale rate in order to determine the exchange rate offered to a sender for remittance transfers for a particular currency. If the provider must estimate an exchange rate for another remittance transfer for the same currency, the remittance transfer provider must estimate the exchange rate by applying the same spread (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> fixed percentage) to the most recent publicly available wholesale rate.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 32(c)(1)(ii)-1 provided that publicly available sources of information containing the most recent wholesale exchange rate for a currency include, for example, U.S. news services, such as Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal, and the New York Times; a recipient country's national news service; and a recipient country's central bank or other government agency. The Bureau did not receive any comments on this aspect of the proposal. One industry commenter, however, noted that for currency exchange rates not listed by a U.S. news service, remittance transfer providers could rely on the basis for estimates provided under proposed § 205.32(c)(1)(iii). Accordingly, proposed comment 32(c)(1)(ii)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed, but renumbered as comment 32(c)(1)-2 for organizational purposes.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters, however, stated that it was unclear which most recent publicly available wholesale exchange rate should apply because rates may fluctuate throughout the day and may be published on a Web site in addition to the rate that may be available in a news service publication. Based on these comments, the Bureau is adopting new comment 32(c)(1)-4 to provide guidance when an exchange rate for a currency is published or provided multiple times within a day. Specifically, comment 32(c)(1)-4 clarifies that if the exchange rate for a currency is published or provided multiple times throughout the day because the exchange rate fluctuates throughout the day, a remittance transfer provider may use any exchange rate available on that day for the purposes of determining the “most recent” exchange rate.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The approach in proposed § 205.32(c)(1)(iii) permitted the use of the most recent exchange rate offered by the person making funds available directly to the designated recipient as the basis for providing an estimate. However, in some instances the exchange rate used for a transfer may be set by other institutions, such as a foreign ACH counterpart or an intermediary institution in a transmittal route that is not a correspondent institution. For example, the first intermediary institution in the transmittal route that is in the recipient country may set the exchange rate and conduct the currency exchange before transmitting the remittance transfer to the recipient institution, which then makes the funds available to the designated recipient. Therefore, upon further consideration, proposed § 205.32(c)(1)(iii), in renumbered § 1005.32(c)(1)(iii), is revised to state that an estimate may be also based on the most recent exchange rate offered or used by the person in the transmittal route setting the exchange rate. The Bureau notes that § 1005.32(c)(1)(iii), as revised, addresses circumstances in which the local currency is infrequently traded or when wholesale exchange rates would not have been publicly available.</analysisParagraph>

Under the first approach, an estimate must be based on the remittance transfer provider's most recent transfer to an account at the designated recipient's institution. Under the second approach, an estimate must be based on the representations of the intermediary institutions along a representative route identified by the remittance transfer provider that the requested transfer could travel.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 32(c)(3)(ii)-1 clarified that a remittance transfer from a sender's account at an insured institution to the designated recipient's institution may take several routes, depending on the correspondent relationships each institution in the transmittal route has with other institutions. Proposed comment 32(c)(3)(ii)-1 further clarified that, in providing an estimate of the fees required to be disclosed under proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(vi) pursuant to the temporary exception, an insured institution may rely upon the representations of the institutions that act as intermediaries in any one of the potential transmittal routes that it reasonably believes a requested remittance transfer may travel.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters argued that insured institutions do not know what other fees an intermediary institution or the designated recipient's institution may charge. For example, a remittance transfer provider may not know the fees a receiving institution may charge its own customers for receiving a remittance transfer. Another commenter suggested that some small insured institutions may be unaware of the number of intermediary institutions involved in the transmittal route. Commenters also argued that it would be difficult to obtain sufficient information to be able to disclose any estimates, and that the requirement would impose operational burden on insured institutions, particularly on insured institutions that do not send international wire transfers frequently or are unable to obtain representations of intermediary institutions.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau believes that, consistent with the statute, it is appropriate to require remittance transfer providers to disclose fees imposed by intermediary institutions or the designated recipient's institution in order to determine the amount of currency received by the recipient. The Bureau further believes that the rule provides sufficient flexibility to facilitate compliance and that representative transmittal routes are readily determinable. In addition, the Bureau notes that a remittance transfer provider may be required to estimate other fees as required by § 1005.32(b)(1)(vi) in other circumstances. For example, if a remittance transfer provider estimates the exchange rate under the § 1005.32(b) permanent exception, a provider may be required to estimate other fees that are imposed as a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient. Therefore, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to provide additional clarification. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting a new § 1005.32(c)(3)(i) to provide that for other fees that are imposed as a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient, an estimate must be based on the estimated exchange rate provided in accordance with § 1005.32(c)(1), prior to any rounding of the estimated exchange rate. Furthermore, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 205.32(c)(3) with a technical revision in renumbered § 1005.32(c)(3)(ii). Comment 32(c)(3)(ii)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed, but is renumbered as comment 32(c)(3)-1 for organizational purposes.</analysisParagraph>

Proposed comment 32(c)(4)-1 clarified that proposed § 205.32(c)(4) permits a provider to give an estimate only when the taxes imposed in a recipient country are a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient. In other contexts where taxes may be imposed, a remittance transfer provider can determine the exact amount, such as in the case of a tax of a specific amount. The Bureau did not receive comments on this aspect of the proposal.

            <title>Section 1005.32 Estimates</title>
            <analysisParagraph>The statute provides two exceptions to the requirement to disclose the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient. The first exception is in EFTA section 919(a)(4). It provides that, subject to rules prescribed by the Bureau, disclosures by insured depository institutions or credit unions regarding the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient will be deemed to be accurate in certain circumstances so long as the disclosure provides a reasonably accurate estimate of the amount of currency to be received. Under the statute, a remittance transfer provider may use this exception only if: (i) It is an insured depository institution or insured credit union (collectively, an “insured institution” as described in more detail below) conducting a transfer from an account that the sender holds with it; and (ii) the insured institution is unable to know, for reasons beyond its control, the amount of currency that will be made available to the designated recipient. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> EFTA section 919(a)(4). This exception (the “temporary exception”) expires five years after the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, on July 21, 2015. If the Bureau determines that expiration of the exception would negatively affect the ability of insured institutions to send remittances to foreign countries, the Bureau may extend the exception to not longer than ten years after enactment (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> to July 21, 2020). <em data-original="E-03">See</em> EFTA section 919(a)(4)(B).</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The second exception is in EFTA section 919(c). It provides that if the Bureau determines that a recipient country does not legally allow, or the method by which transactions are made in the recipient country do not allow, a remittance transfer provider to know the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient, the Bureau may prescribe rules addressing the issue. EFTA section 919(c) further states that if rules are prescribed, they must include standards for the remittance transfer provider to provide: (i) A receipt that is consistent with EFTA sections 919(a) and (b); and (ii) a reasonably accurate estimate of the currency to be received. The second exception (the “permanent exception”) does not have a sunset date.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed § 205.32 to implement the two exceptions in EFTA sections 919(a)(4) and (c). Proposed § 205.32 generally permitted a remittance transfer provider to disclose estimates if it cannot determine exact amounts for the reasons specified in the statute. The Bureau is adopting § 205.32 generally as proposed in renumbered § 1005.32, with clarifications and revisions in response to comments received, as discussed in detail below. In addition, the Bureau is adopting new comment 32-1 to provide additional guidance on the circumstances when estimates may be provided. Specifically, new comment 32-1 states that estimates as permitted in § 1005.32(a) and (b) may be used in the pre-payment disclosure described in § 1005.31(b)(1), the receipt disclosure described in § 1005.31(b)(2), the combined disclosure described in § 1005.31(b)(3), and the pre-payment disclosures and receipt disclosures for both first and subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers described in § 1005.36(a)(1) and (2).</analysisParagraph>

            <title>Section 1005.32 Estimates</title>
            <analysisParagraph>Consistent with EFTA section 919, the 2012 Final Rule generally requires that disclosures provided to senders state the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes that will apply to a remittance transfer and the actual amount that will be received by the designated recipient of a remittance transfer.  Section 1005.32, as adopted in the 2012 Final Rule, includes only three specific exceptions to this requirement.  First, consistent with EFTA section 919(a)(4), § 1005.32(a) of the 2012 Final Rule provides a temporary exception for certain transfers by insured institutions.  Second, consistent with EFTA section 919(c), § 1005.32(b)(1) provides a permanent exception for transfers to certain countries.  Third, the 2012 Final Rule also includes an exception under § 1005.32(b)(2) for transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of the transfer.  Thus, a remittance transfer provider is permitted to estimate exchange rates, fees, and taxes that are required by § 1005.31 to be disclosed to the extent permitted in § 1005.32(a) and (b).  The December Proposal would have created additional exceptions to permit estimation with respect to certain recipient institution fees under proposed § 1005.32(b)(4) and national foreign taxes under proposed § 1005.32(b)(3).  The proposed related commentary would have described the particular methods that could be used to estimate under these two methods.  As discussed above, under § 1005.31(d), in both cases, the provider would have been required to disclose that the amount was estimated pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) and (vii).</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Given that the 2013 Final Rule does not require the disclosure of non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected by a person other than the remittance transfer provider (see § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi)), the two proposed estimation methods are now unnecessary.  As a result, the proposed changes to the 2012 Final Rule under § 1005.32(b)(3) and (4) are not being adopted nor is the Bureau adopting the related proposed changes to the commentary. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> proposed comments 32(b)(3) and (4).</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Instead, as described below, the Bureau is adopting a new § 1005.32(b)(3) to describe possible reasonable estimation methods that can be used where a remittance transfer provider elects to disclose non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected by a person other than the provider.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) of the 2012 Final Rule defines as an error a remittance transfer provider's failure to make funds available to the designated recipient by the date of availability stated on the receipt or combined disclosure, subject to three listed exceptions, including an exception for remittance transfers made with fraudulent intent by the sender or a person working in concert with the sender. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C).  Comment 33(a)-5 to the 2012 Final Rule elaborates on the definition of the term “error” under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) and explains that such errors under subpart B of Regulation E include, among other things, the late delivery of funds, the total non-delivery of a remittance transfer, and the delivery of funds to the wrong account. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comments 33(a)-5.1 and .ii.  The commentary further notes that if only a portion of the funds are made available by the disclosed date of availability, then § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) does not apply, but § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) may apply instead.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As explained under comment 33(c)-2 in the 2012 Final Rule, an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) would include situations where a remittance transfer provider failed to make funds in connection with a remittance transfer available to a designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability because the sender provided an incorrect account number to the remittance transfer provider.  After issuance of the 2012 Final Rule, the Bureau received comments from industry that providers often have no means to verify designated recipients' account numbers for remittance transfers into foreign bank accounts.  As a result, providers could have to bear the potentially significant costs of their customers' mistakes in cases in which funds were deposited in the wrong account and could not be recovered as a result of the sender's provision of an incorrect account number.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In the December Proposal, the Bureau proposed to revise the definition of error in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) by adding a fourth, conditional exception.  Proposed § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) would have excluded from the definition of error a failure to make funds available to the designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability, where such failure resulted from the sender having given the remittance transfer provider an incorrect account number, provided that the provider met the conditions set forth in proposed § 1005.33(h).  These proposed conditions, would have required providers to notify senders of the risk that their funds could be lost, to investigate reported errors, and to attempt to recover the missing funds.  In addition, the exception would have been limited to situations in which the funds were actually deposited into the wrong account.  Where these conditions were met, the proposed exception would not have required providers to bear the cost of refunding or resending transfers.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau sought comment on the proposed exception generally and whether it should be limited to mistakes regarding account numbers or expanded to include other incorrect information provided by senders in connection with remittance transfers, such as routing numbers.  Each of these is discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisSection>
                <title>Exception for Senders' Mistakes Regarding Account Numbers</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters uniformly supported the addition of the proposed exception to the definition of error where the error was caused by the sender's provision of an incorrect account number.  They put forth a number of reasons why they favored the proposed change.  In many respects, these comments expanded upon those received prior to the December Proposal.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters reiterated earlier concerns about the large potential exposure given their general inability of remittance transfer providers to validate the accuracy of a designated recipient's account number provided in connection with a wire transfers and similar types of open network transfers sent to accounts at banks and other institutions abroad.  These commenters argued that providers sending these transfers over open networks generally have limited ability to cross-check account numbers with the names of accountholders prior to sending transfers because they often have no direct relationships with recipient institutions and thus no means of accessing those institutions' account information.  Commenters further stated that as a result, the only way for a provider to validate such numbers may be to contact the recipient institution manually, which may be time-consuming and difficult due to language and time zone issues.  Such validation would necessitate manual handling of remittance transfers and limit the ability of providers to use automated systems, which are less costly than manual handling of each transfer.  Commenters stated their concern that manual validation could substantially increase costs to senders and delay the processing of remittance transfers.  Relatedly, several commenters claimed that it was infeasible to expect providers to develop account number verification systems, automated or otherwise, before the effective date of the 2012 Final Rule (which was scheduled to take effect on February 7, 2013) due to the number of institutions worldwide that would need to adjust their systems used for transmitting wires.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters also reiterated concerns expressed prior to the issuance of the December Proposal regarding the potential for fraud if a sender's provision of an incorrect account number is considered an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv).  As discussed in the December Proposal, commenters had stated that the 2012 Final Rule could enable fraudulent activity to flourish because, if unscrupulous senders provided incorrect account numbers and funds were sent to a coconspirator, remittance transfer providers might have to send transfer amounts again to another coconspirator without first recovering them.  Commenters argued that the fraud exception in the 2012 Final Rule—§ 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C)—is insufficient because for providers to use the exception would be difficult in most circumstances.  Many industry commenters stated that providers in the United States typically have a limited ability to gather evidence of fraud from a recipient institution abroad or to mandate cooperation from foreign institutions with whom they have no direct relationship.  Industry commenters also noted that even if a provider suspected fraud, the lack of evidence would cause providers to hesitate to accuse one of its own customers of fraud.  Industry commenters also stated that the 2012 Final Rule departed from current industry practice by requiring that remittance transfer providers resend or refund a remittance transfer even when a sender's mistake results in mis-delivery of funds that cannot be recovered.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters expressed concern that in light of the significant exposure under the 2012 Final Rule's sender error provisions, if the Bureau did not revise the error resolution procedures as it proposed to do in the December Proposal, many remittance transfer providers would curtail their remittance transfer offerings such as by limiting the amount permitted per transfer, limiting transfers to certain trusted customers, or by exiting the remittance transfer business altogether.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters also argued that the Bureau should not have adopted the approach taken in the 2012 Final Rule to sender error because it was not mandated by statute.  One of these commenters opined that because the Dodd-Frank Act was not specific with respect to who must bear the cost of a mis-directed remittance transfer, the Bureau's legal authority to require remittance transfer providers to bear the cost of mistakes made by senders was questionable.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In contrast to comments from industry, consumer group commenters were divided on whether the Bureau should adopt the proposed exception for certain sender errors.  Two consumer groups supported the proposed change because, they contended, the proposed rule achieved the appropriate allocation of risk between senders and remittance transfer providers and incentivized providers to minimize the occurrence of errors.  These commenters also stated that it would be difficult for providers, particularly small providers, to retrieve funds sent to the wrong account.  They further asserted that it would be difficult for providers, and particularly credit unions, to accuse their customers or members of fraud in order to avail themselves of the fraud exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C).  As a result, these consumer group commenters argued that absent the proposed revision, many providers might choose to exit the remittance transfer business altogether, resulting in a loss of access to senders.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Other consumer groups opposed the proposed changes and urged the Bureau not to amend the 2012 Final Rule with respect to sender mistakes regarding account numbers that result in the loss of the transfer amount.  First, some of these groups argued that the Bureau would be undermining the intent of Congress, which, they argued, was to motivate industry to change existing practices to develop more secure means of sending remittance transfers.  By adopting the proposed exception, these commenters argued, the Bureau would eliminate any incentive for remittance transfer providers to develop enhanced security procedures.  Relatedly, some consumer groups also argued that the existing definition of error in subpart A of Regulation E, specifically § 1005.11(a)(ii), already addresses the situation in which a consumer provides an incorrect recipient account number by creating an error for “incorrect” electronic fund transfers.<footnote ref="8">Section 1005.11 of subpart A of Regulation E contains error resolution provisions for electronic fund transfers.  Section 1005.11(a)(ii) states that a potential error under the rule is an “incorrect electronic fund transfer to or from the consumer's account.”</footnote>
                  These commenters noted that insofar as § 1005.11(a)(ii) is phrased in general terms and refers to an “incorrect electronic fund transfer” by its plain language it does not exclude incorrect information provided by a consumer (or any other party).  Insofar as § 1005.11(a)(ii) has long applied to a portion of remittance transfers, the commenters contended that had Congress intended to deny the protections of this provision to consumers, it would have done so more explicitly.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Finally, some consumer group commenters suggested that the Bureau should not adopt the proposed exception to the definition of error, even if the 2012 Final Rule would result in some remittance transfer providers exiting the market because they are unable to implement adequate verification procedures today.  Alternatively, these commenters suggested that, in order to reduce the risk of market exit, that the Bureau could adopt the proposed revisions, but limit the proposed exception to the definition of error to transfers over a certain dollar amount so that senders of smaller transfers would still benefit from the error provisions in the 2012 Final Rule.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Upon consideration of these comments and further consideration and to facilitate compliance, the Bureau is finalizing § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) with several changes from the proposed provision, which are discussed below.  As in the December Proposal, the exception as finalized will only apply if a remittance transfer provider can meet certain conditions including warnings to senders and use of reasonable validation methods where available.  These conditions are set forth in § 1005.33(h) and also are discussed in detail below.  Where the exception applies, providers will not be required to bear the cost of refunding or resending transfers if funds ultimately cannot be recovered.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As it noted in the December Proposal, the Bureau believes that this exception appropriately allocates risk based on remittance transfer providers' existing methods for sending transfers, which often do not allow for or facilitate verification of designated recipients' account numbers.  The Bureau continues to believe it is important for industry to develop improved security procedures and expects to engage in a dialogue with industry about how to encourage the growth of improved controls and communication mechanisms.  But the Bureau understands that industry is unlikely to be reasonably able to implement such changes in the near future.  Subpart B of Regulation E does not regulate most recipient institutions, and the Bureau has concluded that individual providers, and particularly those sending transfers through open networks have limited ability to influence the practices of financial institutions worldwide in the short term.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Absent such changes, the Bureau is concerned that remittance transfer providers will exit the market or reduce remittance offerings rather than risk having to bear the cost of the entire transfer amount where funds are deposited into the wrong  account due to the sender's provision of an incorrect account number.  The Bureau believes such an interim disruption would not be in consumers' best interests, and thus has finalized the proposed exception as discussed below.  The Bureau, however, will continue to evaluate the development of procedures as it monitors providers' implementation of and compliance with the 2013 Final Rule.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau disagrees with those consumer group commenters that the 2012 Final Rule should be allowed to take effect absent the proposed exception for sender account number mistakes, and that the Bureau should instead monitor whether the concerns summarized in the December Proposal—such as increased fraud and remittance transfer providers exiting the market—actually materialize.  As stated above and in the December Proposal, the Bureau is concerned that absent the proposed change, some providers would severely curtail their offerings or withdraw from the remittance transfer business altogether, and such a market change could have a negative impact on senders.  The Bureau also does not believe, as commenters suggested, that it is appropriate to limit the scope of the exception to larger value transfers, because doing so could potentially encourage providers to limit senders' access to smaller value transfers.  In addition, the Bureau does not believe it appropriate to engage in line drawing or to provide differential protections in this circumstance.  Furthermore, the Bureau disagrees that the proposed exception would harm senders in that the exception in many ways maintains the status quo insofar as the Bureau believes that, today, senders typically bear the loss when their mistake leads to a mis-deposit.  Nor does the Bureau believe that the problem of senders losing the transfer amount is particularly widespread today; insofar as the status quo is maintained, the Bureau does not expect this to change.  The Bureau's outreach confirmed that in most cases where there is a problem in the transmission of a remittance transfer, the provider is able to retrieve the funds or have them routed properly.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>With regard to commenters' arguments about the Bureau's statutory authority, the Bureau disagrees both with industry participant and consumer group arguments that the EFTA or section 1073 of the Dodd-Frank Act specifies which party must bear the cost of a sender's mistake with respect to remittance transfer.  Rather, EFTA section 919 gives the Bureau broad discretion to set standards for remittance transfer providers with respect to error resolution, including to define errors, and does not mandate a specific result with regard to which party should bear the risk of loss under any particular circumstances.  Nor does the Bureau believe that the definition of error in subpart A of Regulation E, which does not apply to all remittance transfers, precludes the Bureau from adopting more specifically tailored error resolutions, and corresponding definitions, applicable to all remittance transfers under subpart B of Regulation E. <em data-original="E-03">See also</em> § 1005.33(f).  Accordingly, the Bureau has adopted the proposed exception for sender account number mistakes subject to specific conditions discussed below.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisSection>
                <title>The Scope of the Sender Error Exception</title>
                <analysisParagraph>As noted above the Bureau also sought comment on the scope of the proposed exception to the definition of error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) and whether it should apply to incorrect information provided by senders in addition to designated recipients' account numbers and, in particular, whether the proposed exception should apply in cases in which senders make mistakes regarding routing numbers or similar institution identifiers in addition to mistakes regarding account numbers.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In response, many industry commenters suggested that the proposed exception be expanded to refer to sender mistakes regarding any information provided by a sender in connection with a remittance transfer rather than just mistaken account numbers, as proposed.  Other commenters listed specific types of incorrect information that should be addressed by the exception to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv), such as:  Routing numbers, Business Identifier Codes (BICs), Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication codes (SWIFT codes), International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs), local bank codes, prepaid, debit or credit card account numbers, recipient institutions' names, designated recipients' names, escrow account numbers, currencies in which transfers will be received, incomplete wire instructions, and recipients' email addresses, phone numbers, and addresses.  Commenters offered different reasons as to why the proposed exception should be expanded to include sender mistakes regarding each suggested type of information.  In addition to considering these comments, the Bureau conducted additional outreach to understand the nature of errors related to the suggested types of information and why remittance transfer providers thought they should be included in any exception to an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) in the 2012 Final Rule.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Many of the industry commenters that urged that the proposed exception should be extended to all mistakes made by senders argued, as noted above, that there is no statutory basis to make remittance transfer providers bear the cost of all senders' mistakes.  Relatedly, one commenter argued that no other consumer finance statute protects consumers from their own errors and that there is a distinction between allocating risk to a provider for mistakes by third parties, or where fault cannot be determined, and requiring providers to bear the cost of senders' mistakes.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As for the specific types of information provided by senders, nearly all industry commenters and some consumer group commenters favored expanding the proposed exception to apply to sender mistakes regarding routing numbers and other recipient institution identifiers.  Commenters explained that for many remittance transfers into accounts, remittance transfer providers request, in addition to the number of the designated recipient's account, an alphanumeric identifier of the recipient institution, similar to the routing numbers used to identify depository institutions in the United States.<footnote ref="9">For example, in order to route a wire transfer to a foreign bank, a bank in the United States may require that the sender provide the name of the designated recipient and the recipient's institution as well as the BIC for the recipient's institution, and the recipient's account number.</footnote>
                  Providers, and any other intermediaries involved in the transfer, then use this identifier to determine the institution to which the transfer should be sent.  Commenters further explained that, in many cases, a sender's mistake regarding the identifier of a bank could pose a similar problem for a provider as an incorrect account number.  The commenters stated that, like account numbers, many providers lack the ability to verify the accuracy of alphanumerical identifiers related to recipient institutions that are provided by senders.  If a recipient institution identifier is incorrect and the provider does not match it with an institution name, funds could conceivably be mis-deposited if the institution represented by the incorrect routing number has an account matching the number provided by the sender.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In addition to sender  mistakes regarding account numbers and recipient institution identifiers, several commenters asked that the Bureau exclude from the definition of error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) senders' mistakes regarding correspondent routing instructions (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> if the sender suggests that the remittance transfer provider send the transfer through a particular correspondent that is unable to complete the transfer).  Several commenters stated that generally this sort of mistake generally would lead to a delay of a transfer and not its mis-deposit into the wrong account.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Finally, several industry commenters argued that the proposed exception should be expanded to apply to senders' mistakes regarding designated recipients' names and information that the designated recipient themselves might need to apply the proceeds of remittance transfers after receipt.  For example, a trade association commenter asked that the Bureau expand the proposed exception to include sender mistakes about additional information a designated recipient needs to process a transfer it receives.  The commenter stated that if, for example, the designated recipient is an insurer, it might need the designated recipient's policy number to process the funds received.  Similarly, one commenter stated that if a designated recipient is a property lessor, the lessor might need an identifying apartment number in order to process a transfer that is a rent payment.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>After careful consideration of the comments received and upon further consideration, the Bureau is expanding the exception to the definition of error in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to include situations where a sender has provided an incorrect recipient institution identifier in addition to situations where a sender provides an incorrect account number, as long as the error results in a mis-deposit of the funds and that the remittance transfer provider meets the conditions set forth in § 1005.33(h).  As discussed below, the 2013 Final Rule includes as one such condition, that the provider use reasonably available means to verify the recipient institution identifier provided by the sender. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(h)(2).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Based on its monitoring of the remittance market, review of comment letters, and other outreach, the Bureau believes that situations in which an incorrect recipient institution identifier could result in a transfer being deposited into the wrong account are exceedingly rare but not unheard of.  More typically, the Bureau understands, a mistaken identifier will result in a transfer that is returned to the remittance transfer provider because either the identifier does not match any institution or the account number does not match an account at the institution to which the transfer is mistakenly directed.  Nevertheless, the Bureau is expanding the exception in the 2013 Final Rule beyond what was proposed because, upon further consideration, it believes that it is appropriate to treat mistakes in recipient institution identifiers similarly to mistakes in account numbers.  The two types of identifiers are similar in purpose and, in some cases, are combined into one.  In addition, these identifiers may not be easily verifiable by providers sending remittance transfers over an open network and are used in straight-through, automated processing of transfers.  Additionally, although less likely than as with respect to account numbers, under the 2012 Final Rule an unscrupulous sender could potentially provide an incorrect routing number to perpetrate a fraud with a coconspirator abroad.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Contrary to requests by commenters that the Bureau extend the proposed exception for sender mistakes regarding account numbers to mistakes regarding all types of information, the Bureau is limiting the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to sender mistakes regarding account numbers and recipient institution identifiers because it does not believe it is appropriate to extend the exception to all mistakes a sender might make in connection with a remittance transfer for several reasons.  While the chance of mis-deposit is limited for all sender mistakes, the Bureau believes there is a greater risk for mistakes regarding account numbers and recipient institution identifiers.  However, for most other types of sender mistakes identified by commenters, such as mistakes regarding the recipient's address or wire instructions, the Bureau does not believe that the incorrect information would usually result in a mis-deposit of a remittance transfer.  Instead, the Bureau believes that these mistakes will at most result in a delay of delivery or in non-delivery of the remittance transfer.  In situations where the recipient institution identifies a customer with the same name as the designated recipient but is unable to match that customer's name to the provided account number, the Bureau believes that the recipient institution will generally be unable to apply the funds and that the transfer will be returned or otherwise delayed but that the funds will not be mis-deposited.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe that it is warranted to extend the exception to those sender mistakes that are likely to result only in either a delay or a return of the transfer to the remittance transfer provider, and not the loss of funds, because the cost to the provider of delay or non-delivery differs markedly from the cost of lost transfers.  Under the 2012 Final Rule, when a transfer is delayed or returned to the provider, the provider must refund its fee to the sender. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii).  Additionally, when the transfer is returned to the provider, the sender can request that the transfer be resent at no charge (although third-party fees may be imposed on the resend) or have the transfer amount refunded. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii).  The cost to the provider in these circumstances differs markedly from the cost to the provider under the 2012 Final Rule for a transfer that is mis-deposited into the wrong account and cannot be retrieved.  When a mis-deposit occurs, absent an exception, the provider may have to resend or refund the entire transfer amount if the transfer could not be retrieved from the wrong account rather than merely refund its fee or send a transfer at no cost. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii) and comment 33(c)-2 in the 2012 Final Rule.  Thus, for mis-deposited transfers, the fact that the provider is potentially at risk of having to absorb a loss of principal is far higher than for other types of errors and thus is far more likely to lead to a significant curtailment of services.  Furthermore, the Bureau believes that, in many respects, the remedy under the 2012 Final Rule for non-delivery is similar to many providers' existing practices in that they now resend funds at no charge with the corrected information.  Therefore, to maintain as an error sender mistakes that merely result in delay or non-delivery of the remittance transfer as part of this final rule would not require a significant adjustment for those providers.  Finally, the 2012 Final Rule already allows providers a mechanism to manage uncertainty regarding the date of delivery of funds. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) and comment 32(b)(2)-1 (interpreting § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) to allow a provider to disclose the “latest date on which funds will be available”).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters suggested that the Bureau should make senders, rather than providers, bear the costs of their own mistakes because no other consumer protection regimes makes the regulated entities bear the costs of consumers' mistakes.  The Bureau does not think it is necessary or appropriate that the remittances rules' remedy provisions match perfectly those in other consumer protection regimes, given the unique statutory structure and nature of the transactions at issue.  The Bureau is maintaining the 2012 Final Rule's error provisions regarding sender mistakes other than those covered by the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D), because it believes providers are generally in the best position to institute systems to limit their occurrence and to work with other industry participants to resolve particular mistakes in transmissions.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>With respect to those mistakes that are likely to result only in a delay or non-delivery of a remittance transfer (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> mistakes other than those regarding account number or the recipient institution identifier), the Bureau believes that retaining the current rule, which does not include an exception for such mistakes, strikes the appropriate balance been protecting senders and encouraging providers to limit the incidence of such errors without exposing providers to the risk of loss of the transfer amount.  With respect to those sender mistakes that make it impossible for the recipient (as opposed to the recipient institution) to know how to use the funds received (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> an apartment number to apply a rent payment), the Bureau does not believe that such mistakes would give rise to an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv).  This is true because the 2013 Final Rule only does not define as an error the inability of the designated recipient to timely apply the funds for a particular purpose once a transfer is received.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also does not believe that a sender's provision of an incorrect name would result in an error under the 2013 Final Rule, and thus a sender's provision of an incorrect name need not be included in the exception from the term error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D).  As defined under § 1005.30(c), a designated recipient is “any person specified by the sender as the authorized recipient of a remittance transfer to be received at a foreign country.”  As noted above, comment 30(c)-1 in the 2012 Final Rule stated that a designated recipient can be either a natural person or an organization, such as a corporation.  The Bureau is further clarifying this comment in the 2013 Final Rule to explain that the designated recipient is identified by the name of the person provided by the sender to the remittance transfer provider and disclosed by the provider to the sender pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(iii). <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 30(c)-1.  Thus, assume for example that a sender tells a remittance transfer provider to send a transfer to “Jane Doe” at a foreign bank, the provider discloses “Jane Doe” pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(2)(iii), and the transfer is timely deposited by that bank into Jane Doe's account.  If the sender later asserts that an error occurred because the sender in fact intended the transfer to be sent to “John Doe” but had not communicated that to the provider, no error has occurred under the final rule because “Jane Doe” was the name of the designated recipient stated on the receipt provided to the sender.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In some cases, however, a sender's name can result in an error.  If, for example, the recipient institution could not deliver the remittance transfer described above because no one named “Jane Doe” had an account at the recipient institution, or more than one person named “Jane Doe” had an account at that institution such that the funds could not be applied, the transfer would be delayed or rejected resulting in an error because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information.  Insofar as this would not lead to the deposit of the transfer in the wrong account, the Bureau is not inclined to include these mistakes in the exception.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Commenters also urged the Bureau to include in the exception to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) to mistakes regarding mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and debit, credit and prepaid card numbers, arguing that these additional categories of identifiers warrant the same treatment as those covered by proposed § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D).  Commenters supporting expansion of the exception to include these identifiers generally put forth the same reasons as those discussed above regarding account numbers and recipient institution identifiers.  These commenters generally did not address the practical differences between transfers sent between bank accounts and those sent to other types of accounts.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not think it appropriate to extend the exception to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to these sorts of identifiers for several reasons.  First, § 1005.31(b)(2)(iii) requires that a remittance transfer provider disclose the name of the designated recipient to the sender and comment 30(c)-1 now clarifies that the designated recipient is identified by the name of the person stated on the disclosure provided pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(iii) regardless of what other identifying information that the sender may also have provided to the provider.  Insofar as a provider must disclose the name of the designated recipient on the receipt provided to the sender, the provider is not permitted to process a remittance transfer under the 2013 Final Rule by only disclosing a non-name identifier, such as a card number, email address, or mobile number.  To the extent providers currently send transfers without disclosing a name to the sender, they will not be able to continue doing so once the 2013 Final Rule takes effect.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Second, the Bureau believes that in the current market, only a small number of providers send remittance transfers to designated recipients who are identified by mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and debit, credit and prepaid card numbers.  These providers are often conducting transfers between two of their own customers through a closed network, and thus are in position to verify designated recipients' identities.  In other words, for transfers conducted through these closed-networks, both the sender and recipient will have agreed to sign on to the provider's network in order to send or receive funds.  The Bureau understands that, today, a number of the providers using these identifiers may not verify that the identifier matches the name of the designated recipient in every instance.  However, the Bureau believes that unlike providers using account numbers to identify designated recipients in transfers through the open network system, these providers have a reasonable ability to implement security measures in order to limit the possibility that senders make mistakes regarding designated recipients' mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and debit, credit and prepaid card numbers.  These measures might include confirmation codes, test transactions, or other methods to prevent transfers from being sent to the wrong person.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Third, the Bureau believes that the systems are still limited and nascent for transfers in which the mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and debit, credit and prepaid card numbers are used to identify designated recipients and the transfer is not sent entirely over the remittance transfer provider's own network.  As these systems grow, the Bureau expects that providers can proactively design systems in such a way as to allow for the development of better verification protocols.  If, in the future, providers intend to develop new systems to allow transfers using only names and mobile phone numbers to identify designated recipients, for example, the Bureau believes that such systems should be designed to verify that the provided names and numbers match before recipients can receive transfers.  The Bureau does not believe that such methods can be implemented for most transfers sent to bank accounts.  As described above, such transfers are generally sent as wire transfers, through an open network system.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As noted, the Bureau has limited the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to account numbers and recipient institution identifiers in order to encourage the growth of improved controls and communication mechanisms that may generally limit the possibility of other errors in the transmission of remittance transfers.  Furthermore, the Bureau intends to monitor closely industry's ability to verify account numbers and recipient institution identifiers and will consider modifying this exception if it thinks such verification methods become reasonably available and are able to prevent most errors from occurring.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisParagraph>As described above, the Bureau is eliminating the requirement to disclose certain recipient institution fees and taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider and to include such amounts in the amount received, required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) and (b)(2)(i).  Nevertheless, the Bureau believes that where the remittance transfer provider knows or can reasonably estimate any applicable non-covered third-party fee or tax collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider and elects to disclose one or both of such amounts, senders are likely to benefit from more accurate and informative disclosures.  Consequently, § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) permits a provider to disclose any applicable non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider applicable to a remittance transfer in conjunction with the required disclaimers.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In order to encourage the optional disclosure of such information, § 1005.32(b)(3) of the 2013 Final Rule permits remittance transfer providers latitude to estimate any applicable non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider.  Such estimates may be based on reasonable sources of information.  The Bureau acknowledges that permitting providers to estimate such amounts may result in providers providing disclosures that may not reflect the actual charge by individual recipient institutions or the taxes levied upon such transfers.  Nonetheless, the Bureau believes that permitting a reasonable approximation of the amount of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on the remittance transfer by persons other than the remittance transfer provider that could be assessed based on reasonable sources would provide senders valuable information about the amount to be received while also allowing the provider sufficient flexibility to disclose such information.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>New comment 32(b)(3)-1 further notes that reasonable sources of information may include, for example: Information obtained from recent transfers to the same institution or the same country or region; fee schedules from the recipient institution; fee schedules from the recipient institution's competitors; surveys of recipient institution fees in the same country or region as the recipient institution; information provided or surveys of recipient institutions' regulators or taxing authorities; commercially or publicly available databases, services or sources; and information or resources developed by international nongovernmental organizations or intergovernmental organizations.  The 2013 Final Rule also includes new model forms that provides examples of how such information may be integrated within the disclaimers of § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii). <em data-original="E-03">See</em> Model Forms 30(b)-(d).</analysisParagraph>

Conforming changes have also been made to comments 32(a)(1)-1, (a)(1)-2.ii, 32(a)(1)-3.ii, and 32(b)(2)-1 so that these comments and related headings, as finalized, use the term “covered third-party fees” rather than “other fees.”</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In § 1005.32(c)(3)(ii), however, the Bureau notes that it has retained a reference to fees imposed by both the intermediary and the final recipient's institution.  Although fees imposed by the recipient institution are generally non-covered third-party fees, under § 1005.30(h), certain recipient institution fees may qualify as covered third-party fees if they are imposed by an agent of the provider. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 30(h)-2.ii.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>32(b) Permanent Exception for Transfers to Certain Countries</title>
            <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.32(b) contained the permanent exception set forth in EFTA section 919(c). Under EFTA section 919(c), if the Bureau determines that a recipient nation does not legally allow, or the method by which transactions are made to the recipient country do not allow, a remittance transfer provider to know the amount of currency that will be received, the Bureau may issue rules to permit the remittance transfer provider to provide a reasonably accurate estimate. The Board's proposal specifically noted that there is at least one recipient country where a particular method of remittances do not allow remittance transfer providers to know the amount of currency that will be received.<footnote ref="80">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 76 FR 29923.</footnote></analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In light of that determination, the proposed rule allowed estimates to be provided for amounts required to be disclosed under proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(iv) through (vii) for transfers to certain countries. Like the temporary exception in EFTA section 919(a)(4), the permanent exception in EFTA section 919(c) only addresses estimates for the amount of currency that will be received by a designated recipient. For the reasons described above with respect to the temporary exception, proposed § 205.32(b) also permitted disclosure of estimates for the exchange rate, the transfer amount in the currency made available to the designated recipient, and taxes imposed in the recipient country that are a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient. The Bureau did not receive any comments on this aspect of the proposal. For the reasons set forth above with regard to the temporary exception and to effectuate the purposes of EFTA and facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to adopt this proposed permanent exception in § 1005.32(b).</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.32(b)(1) allowed estimates to be provided for the exchange rate, transfer amount, other fees and taxes, and total to recipient disclosures (adopted as § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) through (vii) above), if a remittance transfer provider cannot determine exact amounts because the laws of the recipient country do not permit such a determination.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters raised concerns about whether remittance transfer providers have the resources to determine whether this exception applies. Consumer group commenters argued that the statute requires the Bureau to determine which recipient countries qualify for the permanent exception, rather than leaving the determination to individual market participants. Both industry and consumer group commenters recommended that the Bureau maintain a list of countries or a database, updated annually, to which the permanent exception based on the laws of a recipient country would apply.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that it is appropriate for remittance transfer providers to identify and comply with a recipient country's currency laws. The Bureau also believes that remittance transfer providers and their correspondents generally are able to obtain this information because they are engaged in the business of remittance transfers to recipient countries and must comply with any applicable law that prevents the remittance transfer provider from determining exchange rates or exact amounts. Nonetheless, in response to comments received and upon further consideration, the Bureau is revising proposed § 205.32(b) to facilitate compliance by providing a safe harbor list of countries which qualify for the permanent exception.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, the Bureau is renumbering proposed § 205.32(b) as § 1005.32(b)(1) and adopting new § 1005.32(b)(2) to provide a safe harbor. New § 1005.32(b)(2) states that a remittance transfer provider may rely on the list of countries published by the Bureau to determine whether estimates may be provided under the permanent exception, unless the provider has information that a country's laws or the method by which transactions are conducted in that country permits a determination of the exact disclosure amount.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau is adopting commentary on new § 1005.32(b)(2). New comment 32(b)-5 provides guidance on the safe harbor list published by the Bureau. New comment 32(b)-6 provides further guidance on reliance on the Bureau-provided list of countries that qualify for the permanent exception. New comment 32(b)-7 addresses circumstance where there is a change in laws of the recipient country.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 32(b)(1)-1 clarified that the “laws of the recipient country” do not permit a remittance transfer provider to determine exact amounts when a law or regulation of the recipient country requires the person making funds directly available to the designated recipient to apply an exchange rate that is: (i) Set by the government of the recipient country after the remittance transfer provider sends the remittance transfer; or (ii) set when the designated recipient chooses to claim the funds. Comment 32(b)(1)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed, but renumbered as comment 32(b)-1 for organizational purposes.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>One commenter requested clarification about whether proposed comment 32(b)(1)-1 covered instances where the local currency is thinly traded and the laws of a recipient country require an authorized dealer to set the exchange rate when the remittance transfer is received. The Bureau believes that the proposed comment already covers such circumstances because the government of the recipient country, acting through an authorized dealer, sets the exchange rate after the remittance transfer has been sent. In addition, the transfer may also qualify for the permanent exception if the exchange rate is required by law to be set by the authorized dealer when the recipient claims the funds.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comments 32(b)(1)-2.i. and 32(b)(1)-2.ii. provided examples illustrating the application of the exception. Proposed comment 32(b)(1)-2.i. explained that the laws of the recipient country do not permit a remittance transfer provider to determine the exact exchange rate required to be disclosed under proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(iv) (adopted as § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) above) when, for example, the government of the recipient country sets the exchange rate daily and the funds are made available to the designated recipient in the local currency the day after the remittance transfer provider sends the remittance transfer. Under such circumstances, an estimate for the exchange rate would be permitted because the remittance transfer provider cannot determine a rate that a foreign government has yet to set.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In contrast, proposed comment 32(b)(1)-2.ii. explained that the laws of the recipient country permit a remittance transfer provider to determine the exact exchange rate required to be disclosed under proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(iv) (adopted as § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) above) if, for example, the government of the recipient country ties the value of its currency to the U.S. dollar. The Bureau did not receive significant comment on comment 32(b)(1)-2.

              <title>32(b)(1)(ii) Method by Which Transactions are Made in the Recipient Country</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.32(b)(2) allowed estimates to be provided for the exchange rate, transfer amount, other fees and taxes, and total to recipient disclosures (adopted as § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) through (vii) above), if a remittance transfer provider cannot determine exact amounts because the method by which transactions are made in the recipient country does not permit such a determination.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Based on the Board's outreach and interpretation of the statute, the Board stated its belief that the exception for methods by which transactions are made in the recipient country under proposed § 205.32(b)(2) was intended to permit estimates for certain international ACH transactions. Specifically, the Board interpreted the exception under § 205.32(b)(2) to apply to remittances sent via international ACH on terms negotiated by the government of the United States and the government of a recipient country where the exchange rate is set after the transfer is sent. Accordingly, proposed comment 32(b)(2)-1 stated that the “method by which transactions are made in the recipient country” does not permit a remittance transfer provider to determine exact amounts when transactions are sent via international ACH on terms negotiated between the United States government and the recipient country's government, under which the exchange rate is set by the recipient country's central bank after the provider sends the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters argued that the Bureau should adopt a broader reading of the statute, and that international wire transfers should be covered by the permanent exception. These commenters argued that international wire transfers are a method by which transactions are made in a recipient country that does not allow the remittance transfer provider to know the amount of currency that will be received by a designated recipient and should thus qualify for the permanent exception. One industry commenter stated that the permanent exception is helpful for certain international ACH transactions; however, the benefit is limited by the number of recipient countries that participate in the Federal Reserve System's FedGlobal ACH program. Other industry commenters requested that all international ACH transfers be covered by the permanent exception and that the exception should not be limited to those that are sent on terms negotiated between the United States government and the recipient country's government. These commenters noted that all cross-border ACH transfers, regardless of how the exchange rate is set, are subject to similar difficulties as certain international ACH transfers that qualify for the permanent exception. Consumer group commenters supported the proposal's application of the permanent exception based on the method to certain international ACH transfers.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In each case, the Bureau agrees with the Board's interpretation. The Bureau believes that extending the permanent exception to international wire transfers and all international ACH transactions would be inconsistent with the statutory language and purpose of the provision, which specifically refers to methods of transfer <em data-original="E-03">in a recipient country</em> (emphasis added). The Bureau must give meaning to this phrase, and does not believe that the interpretation urged by commenters is dependent on a method of transfer in a particular country.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe that the permanent exception in EFTA section 919(c) applies to international wire transfers because wire transfers are not a method that is particular to a specific country or group of countries. Rather, compliance challenges may arise due to the international wire transfer business model, which is based on a chain of correspondents and two-party contractual relationships.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In addition, the application of the permanent exception to international wire transfers and ACH transactions generally would make the temporary exception superfluous. As discussed above, the statute is broad in scope, specifically covering transactions that are account-based and that are not electronic fund transfers, and therefore, covers open network transactions. Further, as described above with regard to the temporary exception, the statute specifically permits the use of estimates by depository institutions and credit unions for certain account-based transactions. If all open network transactions were included in the permanent exception, there would be no need for the temporary exception because nearly all, if not all, the types of transfers that qualify for the temporary exception would be covered by the permanent exception. The Bureau does not believe the temporary exception is superfluous. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to extend the permanent exception to these transactions.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>One commenter argued that the permanent exception for method of transfer should also include instances when the remittance transfer provider and the sender agree to have the exchange rate set at some point in the future (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> floating rate products). As with wire transfers, such an agreement is not a method by which a transaction is made that is particular to a specific country or group of countries. Therefore, the Bureau also believes that this circumstance would not be eligible for the permanent exception. The Bureau notes, however, that the remittance transfer provider that is party to such an agreement may provide estimates of the exchange rate if the remittance transfer provider qualifies for the temporary exception in § 1005.32(a). For the reasons discussed above, proposed § 205.32(b)(2) is adopted as proposed in renumbered § 1005.32(b)(1)(ii). Proposed comment 32(b)(2)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed with clarifying revision, but renumbered as comment 32(b)-3 for organizational purposes.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 32(b)(2)-2 provided examples illustrating the application of the permanent exception. The comment is adopted substantially as proposed, but renumbered as comment 32(b)-4 for organizational purposes. Comment 32(b)-4.i. provides an example of when a remittance transfer would qualify for the exception. The Bureau notes that some comments received indicate that there may be confusion as to the application of the permanent exception provided in § 1005.32(b)(1)(ii) to any transfer sent via international ACH. However, comment 32(b)-4.i. explains that a transfer would only qualify for the exception when sent via international ACH on terms negotiated between the United States government and the recipient country's government, under which the exchange rate is a rate set by the recipient country's central bank or other governmental authority on the business day after the provider has sent the remittance transfer. Under such circumstances, the provider cannot determine the exact exchange rate required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv). Thus, remittance transfers sent via Directo a México currently would qualify for the permanent exception in § 1005.32(b)(1)(ii). Accordingly, proposed comment 32(b)-4.i. is adopted substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comments 32(b)(2)-2.ii. and -2.iii. provided examples of when a remittance transfer would not qualify for the permanent exception in § 1005.32(b)(1)(ii). The Bureau did not receive significant comment on the proposed comments, which are adopted substantially as proposed, with technical and clarifying edits, in renumbered comments 32(b)-4.ii. and 32(b)-4.iii. Comment 32(b)-4.ii. explains that a remittance transfer provider is not permitted to provide estimates under the permanent exception if it sends a remittance transfer via international ACH on terms negotiated between the United States government and a private-sector entity in the recipient country, under which the exchange rate is set by the institution acting as the entry point to the recipient country's payments system on the next business day. In this case, transactions are made using a method negotiated between the United States and a private entity. Nonetheless, remittance transfers sent using such a method may qualify for the temporary exception in § 1005.32(a). Comment 32(b)-4.iii. explains that a remittance transfer provider does not qualify for the permanent exception if, for example, it sends transfers via international ACH on terms negotiated between the United States government and the recipient country's government, under which the exchange rate is set by the recipient country's central bank or other governmental authority before the sender requests a transfer. In such a case, the remittance transfer provider can determine the exchange rate required to be disclosed.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>32(c) Bases for Estimates</title>
            <analysisParagraph>If a remittance transfer qualifies for either the temporary exception in EFTA section 919(a)(4) or the permanent exception in EFTA section 919(c), the statute permits the provider to disclose a reasonably accurate estimate to the sender. Proposed § 205.32(c) stated that estimates provided pursuant to the exceptions in proposed § 205.32(a) and (b) (adopted as § 1005.32(a) and (b) above) must be based on an approach listed in the regulation for the required disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.32(c) further stated that if a remittance transfer provider bases an estimate on an approach that is not listed, the provider complies with proposed § 205.32(c) so long as the designated recipient receives the same, or greater, amount of currency that it would have received had the estimate been based on a listed approach. Thus, use of an approach other than one listed in the proposed rule is compliant with the regulation if the sender is not harmed by such use.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters generally requested greater flexibility in estimating exchange rates and fees. For example, commenters recommended less prescriptive approaches, such as permitting remittance transfer providers to base estimates on reasonably available information, adopting a reasonably accurate standard, or adopting a safe harbor for good faith estimates within a specified tolerance. The Bureau generally concurs with the Board's reasoning in the May 2011 Proposed Rule that providing a list of approaches for calculating estimates would be more helpful to remittance transfer providers and consumers than a less specific standard for calculating estimates. The Bureau believes that requiring estimates be provided based on an approach listed in the regulation will facilitate compliance with the final rule. However, in response to comments received, the Bureau is clarifying proposed § 205.32(c). The safe harbor in proposed § 205.32(c) was intended to provide greater flexibility and to facilitate compliance for remittance transfer providers that may base an estimate on an approach that is not listed in the rule. However, the Bureau notes that under the proposal, the provider would have been required to compare any estimate based on its own approach with an estimate based on a listed approach in order to determine whether the sender would be harmed by such use. The Bureau believes that this comparison would unnecessarily increase the burden of using an unlisted approach and render the safe harbor meaningless. Therefore, the Bureau revises proposed § 205.32(c) to state that if a provider bases an estimate on an approach not listed in the rule, the provider is deemed to be in compliance with the rule so long as the designated recipient receives the same, or greater, amount of funds than the remittance transfer provider disclosed as required under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii). The Bureau believes that this clarification also ensures that the sender is not harmed because the amount of funds received by the designated recipient will be the same or greater than the estimated total amount received as required to be disclosed under § 1005.32(b)(1)(vii). Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 205.32(c) as § 1005.32(c) with amendment.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisParagraph>The approach in proposed § 205.32(c)(1)(i) stated that for remittance transfers qualifying for the § 1005.32(b)(1)(ii) exception, the estimate must be based on the most recent exchange rate set by the recipient country's central bank and reported by a Federal Reserve Bank. Proposed comment 32(c)(1)(i)-1 clarified that if the exchange rate for a remittance transfer sent via international ACH that qualifies for the proposed § 205.32(b)(2) exception is set the following business day, the most recent exchange rate available for a transfer will be the exchange rate set for the day that the disclosure is provided, <em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the current business day's exchange rate. Consumer group commenters generally supported proposed § 205.32(c)(1)(i) and its commentary. Other commenters believed that the application of the proposed § 205.32(b)(2) exception should be broadened generally, as discussed above. Accordingly, proposed § 205.32(c)(1)(i) is adopted as proposed in renumbered § 1005.32(c)(1)(i). Comment 32(c)(1)(i)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed, but renumbered as comment 32(c)(1)-1 for organizational purposes.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The approach in proposed § 205.32(c)(1)(ii) provided that, for other transfers, the estimate must be based on the most recent publicly available wholesale exchange rate. Industry commenters argued that the wholesale interbank exchange rate would not be the rate actually applied to a consumer's remittance transfer, so using the wholesale exchange rate as an estimate would be misleading to consumers. For instance, basing an estimate on only the wholesale rate could consistently overestimate the amount of currency received by a recipient because the wholesale rate does not account for any spread applied to the rate for a sender's remittance transfer to a particular country. One commenter noted that estimates of exchange rates may be based on information from foreign exchange dealers as well as rates available in the marketplace.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Based on comments received and upon further analysis, the Bureau is adopting a revised basis for estimates in renumbered § 1005.32(c)(1)(ii) and its related commentary to address concerns regarding the proposed use of a wholesale exchange rate. Specifically, § 1005.32(c)(1)(ii) provides that, in disclosing the exchange rate as required under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), an estimate must be based on the most recent publicly available wholesale rate and, if applicable, the spread typically applied to such a rate by the remittance transfer provider or its correspondent to the wholesale rate for remittance transfers for a particular currency. The Bureau believes the revised subsection will result in an estimated exchange rate that better approximates the “retail” rate that will apply to a sender's remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>New comment 32(c)(1)-3 provides guidance on applying any spread to the estimate of an exchange rate based on the wholesale exchange rate. If a remittance transfer provider uses the most recent wholesale exchange rate as a basis for an estimate of an exchange rate, the exchange rate estimate must also reflect any spread that is typically applied to such a rate for remittance transfers for a particular currency. For example, assume a remittance transfer provider (or its correspondent) typically applies a spread, such as a fixed percentage, to a wholesale rate in order to determine the exchange rate offered to a sender for remittance transfers for a particular currency. If the provider must estimate an exchange rate for another remittance transfer for the same currency, the remittance transfer provider must estimate the exchange rate by applying the same spread (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> fixed percentage) to the most recent publicly available wholesale rate.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 32(c)(1)(ii)-1 provided that publicly available sources of information containing the most recent wholesale exchange rate for a currency include, for example, U.S. news services, such as Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal, and the New York Times; a recipient country's national news service; and a recipient country's central bank or other government agency. The Bureau did not receive any comments on this aspect of the proposal. One industry commenter, however, noted that for currency exchange rates not listed by a U.S. news service, remittance transfer providers could rely on the basis for estimates provided under proposed § 205.32(c)(1)(iii). Accordingly, proposed comment 32(c)(1)(ii)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed, but renumbered as comment 32(c)(1)-2 for organizational purposes.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters, however, stated that it was unclear which most recent publicly available wholesale exchange rate should apply because rates may fluctuate throughout the day and may be published on a Web site in addition to the rate that may be available in a news service publication. Based on these comments, the Bureau is adopting new comment 32(c)(1)-4 to provide guidance when an exchange rate for a currency is published or provided multiple times within a day. Specifically, comment 32(c)(1)-4 clarifies that if the exchange rate for a currency is published or provided multiple times throughout the day because the exchange rate fluctuates throughout the day, a remittance transfer provider may use any exchange rate available on that day for the purposes of determining the “most recent” exchange rate.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The approach in proposed § 205.32(c)(1)(iii) permitted the use of the most recent exchange rate offered by the person making funds available directly to the designated recipient as the basis for providing an estimate. However, in some instances the exchange rate used for a transfer may be set by other institutions, such as a foreign ACH counterpart or an intermediary institution in a transmittal route that is not a correspondent institution. For example, the first intermediary institution in the transmittal route that is in the recipient country may set the exchange rate and conduct the currency exchange before transmitting the remittance transfer to the recipient institution, which then makes the funds available to the designated recipient. Therefore, upon further consideration, proposed § 205.32(c)(1)(iii), in renumbered § 1005.32(c)(1)(iii), is revised to state that an estimate may be also based on the most recent exchange rate offered or used by the person in the transmittal route setting the exchange rate. The Bureau notes that § 1005.32(c)(1)(iii), as revised, addresses circumstances in which the local currency is infrequently traded or when wholesale exchange rates would not have been publicly available.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.32(c)(3) provided that one of two approaches must be used to estimate the fees imposed by intermediary institutions in connection with an international wire transfer required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). Under the first approach, an estimate must be based on the remittance transfer provider's most recent transfer to an account at the designated recipient's institution. Under the second approach, an estimate must be based on the representations of the intermediary institutions along a representative route identified by the remittance transfer provider that the requested transfer could travel.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 32(c)(3)(ii)-1 clarified that a remittance transfer from a sender's account at an insured institution to the designated recipient's institution may take several routes, depending on the correspondent relationships each institution in the transmittal route has with other institutions. Proposed comment 32(c)(3)(ii)-1 further clarified that, in providing an estimate of the fees required to be disclosed under proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(vi) pursuant to the temporary exception, an insured institution may rely upon the representations of the institutions that act as intermediaries in any one of the potential transmittal routes that it reasonably believes a requested remittance transfer may travel.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters argued that insured institutions do not know what other fees an intermediary institution or the designated recipient's institution may charge. For example, a remittance transfer provider may not know the fees a receiving institution may charge its own customers for receiving a remittance transfer. Another commenter suggested that some small insured institutions may be unaware of the number of intermediary institutions involved in the transmittal route. Commenters also argued that it would be difficult to obtain sufficient information to be able to disclose any estimates, and that the requirement would impose operational burden on insured institutions, particularly on insured institutions that do not send international wire transfers frequently or are unable to obtain representations of intermediary institutions.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau believes that, consistent with the statute, it is appropriate to require remittance transfer providers to disclose fees imposed by intermediary institutions or the designated recipient's institution in order to determine the amount of currency received by the recipient. The Bureau further believes that the rule provides sufficient flexibility to facilitate compliance and that representative transmittal routes are readily determinable. In addition, the Bureau notes that a remittance transfer provider may be required to estimate other fees as required by § 1005.32(b)(1)(vi) in other circumstances. For example, if a remittance transfer provider estimates the exchange rate under the § 1005.32(b) permanent exception, a provider may be required to estimate other fees that are imposed as a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient. Therefore, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to provide additional clarification. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting a new § 1005.32(c)(3)(i) to provide that for other fees that are imposed as a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient, an estimate must be based on the estimated exchange rate provided in accordance with § 1005.32(c)(1), prior to any rounding of the estimated exchange rate. Furthermore, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 205.32(c)(3) with a technical revision in renumbered § 1005.32(c)(3)(ii). Comment 32(c)(3)(ii)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed, but is renumbered as comment 32(c)(3)-1 for organizational purposes.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.32(c)(4) stated that, in disclosing taxes imposed in the recipient country as required under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) that are a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient, an estimate must be based on the estimated exchange rate provided in accordance with § 1005.32(c)(1) and the estimated fees imposed by institutions that act as intermediaries in connection with an international wire transfer provided in accordance with § 1005.32(c)(3). Proposed comment 32(c)(4)-1 clarified that proposed § 205.32(c)(4) permits a provider to give an estimate only when the taxes imposed in a recipient country are a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient. In other contexts where taxes may be imposed, a remittance transfer provider can determine the exact amount, such as in the case of a tax of a specific amount. The Bureau did not receive comments on this aspect of the proposal. Accordingly, proposed § 205.32(c)(4) is adopted in renumbered § 1005.32(c)(4) with revisions for consistency with amended §§ 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) and 1005.32(c)(3). The Bureau is revising comment 32(c)(4)-1 to clarify that a remittance transfer provider can determine the exact amount of other taxes that are a percentage of the amount transferred if the provider can determine the exchange rate and the exact amount of other fees imposed on the remittance transfer. Accordingly, comment 32(c)(4)-1 is adopted with clarification.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>32(a) Temporary Exception for Insured Institutions</title>
            <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.32(a)(1) provided a temporary exception for remittance transfer providers, which permits them to disclose estimates of the exchange rate, the transfer amount, other fees and taxes, and total to recipient if: (i) A remittance transfer provider cannot determine exact amounts for reasons beyond its control; (ii) a remittance transfer provider is an insured institution; and (iii) the remittance transfer is sent from the sender's account with the insured institution.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Most industry commenters generally supported permitting insured institutions to disclose estimates. For example, one commenter stated that restricting the use of estimates could discourage innovation and increase costs to offset risk. Consumer group commenters generally supported the proposed use of estimates but requested that the temporary exception not be extended. Some industry commenters, however, objected to permitting estimates to be disclosed because estimates could lead to inaccurate or misleading disclosures which would disservice consumers.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes permitting estimates, as provided by the temporary exception, is consistent with the statutory language and purpose of EFTA section 919(a)(4). The statute specifically provides that, subject to the Bureau's rules, an insured institution may use a reasonably accurate estimate of the amount of currency received under certain circumstances. Section 1005.32(a)(1) implements the temporary exception generally as proposed, as discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(4) only addresses estimates for the amount of currency that will be received by a designated recipient. Nonetheless, proposed § 205.32(a)(1) also permitted disclosure of an estimate for the exchange rate, the transfer amount in the currency made available to the designated recipient, the fees imposed by intermediaries in the transmittal route, and taxes imposed in the recipient country that are a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient to the extent those amounts are not known for reasons beyond the insured institution's control. In the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the Board stated its belief that, by permitting an estimate of the amount that will be received, Congress must have intended to permit estimates of the components that determine that amount. The inability to determine the exact amount of one or more of these additional items is the reason why the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient must be estimated. Furthermore, the Board stated that permitting estimates of these additional items would help consumers to understand why the amount of currency to be received is displayed as an estimate. The Bureau did not receive any comments on this aspect of the proposal. The Bureau concurs with the Board's reasoning, and believes that to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and facilitate compliance, it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to allow an estimate of the exchange rate, transfer amount, and other fees and taxes disclosures in § 1005.32(a)(1). To not exercise the Bureau's authority in this way would render the statutory exemption essentially meaningless, and the Bureau believes that result could not be intended by the statutory exemption for estimating the amount of currency received.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In the proposed rule, the Board also stated that EFTA section 919(a)(4) only addresses the use of an estimate of the amount of foreign currency that will be received by a designated recipient. However, the proposed rule permitted an estimate of the currency that will be received, whether it is in U.S. dollars or foreign currency. The Bureau understands that senders may send remittance transfers to be paid to the designated recipient in U.S. dollars. When an insured institution sends a remittance transfer via international wire transfer, fees are sometimes deducted by intermediary institutions in the transmittal route with which the sending institution has no correspondent relationship. Although the insured institution may not know the total amount of these fees in advance, it must disclose them to the sender under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). The amount that will be received by the designated recipient, whether that currency is U.S. dollars or foreign currency, will be an estimate if fees imposed by intermediaries are disclosed as estimates. Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of EFTA and to facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to allow an estimate of the amount of currency that will be received, even if that currency is in U.S. dollars.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The proposed commentary to § 205.32(a)(1) provided further guidance on the temporary exception. Specifically, proposed comment 32(a)(1)-1 clarified that an insured institution cannot determine exact amounts “for reasons beyond its control” when: (i) The exchange rate required to be disclosed under proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(iv) is set by a person with which the insured institution has no correspondent relationship after the insured institution sends the remittance transfer; or (ii) fees required to be disclosed under proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(vi) are imposed by intermediary institutions along the transmittal route and the insured institution has no correspondent relationship with those institutions.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter requested clarification regarding instances when an insured institution has a correspondent relationship but may not control or know what exchange rate the correspondent will use. For example, a remittance transfer provider may send a remittance transfer in U.S. dollars and a correspondent institution may be responsible for exchanging to the currency in which funds will be received. Similarly, other industry commenters noted that an insured institution may not know the taxes or fees imposed by a correspondent institution. Although the Bureau acknowledges that some insured institutions currently may not receive certain exchange rate, tax, or fee information from a correspondent institution, the Bureau believes that such information can be obtained through contractual arrangements in a correspondent relationship. The Bureau notes that the statutory exception is only available for circumstances beyond remittance transfer providers' control, and the Bureau believes that adjusting contractual arrangements with correspondent banks to provide for better information relay is within the control of remittance transfer providers. Accordingly, comment 32(a)(1)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed with clarifying revisions and an example.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 32(a)(1)-2 provided examples of scenarios that qualify for the temporary exception. The Bureau did not receive significant comment on the examples provided in the proposed comment. Comment 32(a)(1)-2 is adopted substantially as proposed with clarifying revisions. Comment 32(a)(1)-2.i. clarifies that an insured institution cannot determine the exact exchange rate to disclose for an international wire transfer if the insured institution does not set the exchange rate, and the rate is set when the funds are deposited into the recipient's account by the designated recipient's institution with which the insured institution does not have a correspondent relationship. The insured institution will not know the exchange rate that the recipient institution will apply when the funds are deposited into the recipient's account. Comment 32(a)(1)-2.ii. provides that an insured institution cannot determine the exact fees to disclose under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) if an intermediary institution or the designated recipient's institution, with which the insured institution does not have a correspondent relationship, imposes a transfer or conversion fee. Finally, comment 32(a)(1)-2.iii. states that an insured institution cannot determine the exact taxes to disclose under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) if the insured institution cannot determine the applicable exchange rate or other fees, as described in proposed comments 32(a)(1)-2.i. and 32(a)(1)-2.ii., and the recipient country imposes a tax that is a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient, less any other fees.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 32(a)(1)-3 provided several examples of when an insured institution would not qualify for the exception in proposed § 205.32(a). In each case, the insured institution could determine the exact amount for the relevant disclosure. The proposed examples illustrated that if an insured institution can determine the exact exchange rate, fees, and taxes required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) and (vi), it can determine the exact amounts to be derived from calculations involving them.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive significant comment on the proposed provision, which is adopted substantially as proposed. Comment 32(a)(1)-3.i. explains that an insured institution can determine the exact exchange rate required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) if it converts the funds into the local currency to be received by the designated recipient using an exchange rate that it sets. Comment 32(a)(1)-3.ii. states that an insured institution can determine the exact fees required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) if it has negotiated specific fees with a correspondent institution, and the correspondent institution is the only institution in the transmittal route to the designated recipient's institution, which itself does not impose fees. Finally, comment 32(a)(1)-3.iii. clarifies that an insured institution can determine the exact taxes required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) if the recipient country imposes a tax that is a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient, less any other fees, and the insured institution can determine the exact amount of the applicable exchange rate and other fees. Similarly, the insured institution can determine these taxes if the recipient country imposes a specific sum tax that is not tied to the amount transferred.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.32(a)(2) provided that the temporary exception expires on July 20, 2015, consistent with the five-year term set forth in EFTA section 919(a)(4)(B). EFTA section 919(a)(4)(B) gives the Bureau authority to extend the application of the temporary exception to July 21, 2020, if it determines that termination of the exception would negatively affect the ability of insured institutions to send remittances to foreign countries. The Bureau understands that this exception was intended to avoid an immediate disruption of remittance transfer services by insured institutions using international wire transfers. The exception gives these institutions time to reach agreements and modify systems to provide accurate disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters argued that the temporary exception for insured institutions should be made permanent, or in the alternative, be extended to ten years after the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, which is July 21, 2020. The OCC also noted the ability of the Bureau to extend the temporary exception for insured institutions to ten years after the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act and urged the Bureau to consider the impact of these standards on community banks. In contrast, consumer groups supported the five-year sunset of the temporary exception and requested that the Bureau indicate that the temporary exception will not be extended.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that the sunset of the temporary exception is statutory. In addition, the Bureau believes that there is no basis at this time to assess whether allowing the exception to expire in accordance with the statute would have negative effects where the final rule is just now being issued, initial implementation is expected to take a year, and the market has not yet had a chance to respond to the regulatory requirements. Therefore, the Bureau declines to extend the temporary exception at this time. Finally, the Bureau notes that in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, proposed § 205.32(a)(2) stated July 20, 2015 as the sunset date for the temporary exception provided in § 205.32(a)(1). The final rule includes a technical edit to clarify that the sunset date for the temporary exception is July 21, 2015 in order to avoid potential confusion and promote consistency among references to the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. Accordingly, proposed § 205.32(a)(2) is adopted as proposed in renumbered § 1005.32(a)(2), with a technical edit to reflect the change in date to July 21, 2015.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>For purposes of the temporary exception, proposed § 205.32(a)(3) provided that the term “insured institution” included insured depository institutions as defined in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813) and insured credit unions as defined in section 101 of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1752). Industry commenters generally requested clarification on the application of the temporary exception to uninsured institutions. In particular, these commenters requested that the temporary exception should also include uninsured depository institutions, such as certain U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks. They also argued that uninsured U.S. branches of foreign banks also process retail international wire transfers in the same manner as insured institutions, and would face similar compliance challenges as other insured institutions.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that including uninsured U.S. branches of foreign banks in the term “insured institution” is consistent with the purposes of the statutory exception and will prevent disruption in remittance transfer services. The Bureau notes that section 3(c)(3) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that for certain purposes, the term “insured depository institution” includes any uninsured U.S. branch or agency of a foreign bank or a commercial lending company owned or controlled by a foreign bank. Therefore, the Bureau believes including uninsured U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks in the term “insured institution” is consistent with the statutory exception and section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Accordingly, proposed § 205.32(a)(3) is adopted with clarification in renumbered § 1005.32(a)(3).</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Similarly, one commenter argued that registered broker-dealers should be covered by the temporary exception because they may process international wire transfers. However, as discussed above, the Bureau is clarifying that, for the purposes of this rule, fund transfers in connection with securities transactions are not remittance transfers. Therefore, the Bureau believes further clarification in the rule with respect to this comment is not necessary.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters strongly supported requiring these disclosures to be provided before payment, stating that providing pre-payment disclosures was a centerpiece of the statute. One consumer group commenter stated that pre-payment disclosures were necessary to facilitate shopping.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters, however, opposed the requirement to provide disclosures before payment. One industry trade association commenter argued that the disclosure would provide negligible benefits, citing the fact that some participants in the Board's consumer testing stated that they did not want a disclosure prior to payment. One industry commenter suggested that the pre-payment disclosures would confuse or irritate customers who would not understand why disclosure was being provided at that time. Another industry commenter stated that the pre-payment disclosures created needless compliance costs, which would be passed on to senders. As discussed above, some industry commenters urged that if pre-payment disclosures were required, that they be permitted to be disclosed orally or on a screen, even when the transaction is conducted in person, to reduce compliance costs and delays for the sender.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>A few industry commenters argued that the combined disclosure should be permitted to be provided after payment is made. One industry commenter noted that EFTA section 919(a)(5)(C) only requires combined disclosure to be accurate at the time payment is made. This commenter stated that providing a document similar to a receipt prior to payment is not possible because such a disclosure could not provide accurate information regarding the date and time of the transaction, the amount paid, and the transaction number, which are elements that help establish proof of payment. Therefore, this commenter argued that the rule should permit the combined disclosure to be provided after payment, if a pre-payment disclosure is provided orally or on a screen at the point-of-sale. This commenter maintained that allowing oral or electronic disclosures would be appropriate in the context of EFTA section 919(a)(5) authority to permit combined disclosures and in light of the Bureau's duty to consider the final rule's costs and benefits. At minimum, this commenter believed the Bureau should permit this method of disclosure for senders who have used the provider's service in the past.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Another industry commenter stated that it currently only had the capability of providing information to senders on a register receipt after payment. This commenter believed that requiring a combined disclosure to be provided prior to payment would require printing a pre-payment disclosure in the middle of a sales transaction.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau recognizes the operational challenges associated with providing pre-payment and particularly combined disclosures to senders prior to payment. However, although current practice generally is to provide written disclosures after payment is made, the statute clearly requires certain disclosures to be provided prior to payment and other disclosures to be provided when payment is made for the remittance transfer. The Bureau also believes that the statute precludes combined disclosures from being provided to senders after payment or in a non-written format. EFTA section 919(a)(5)(C) affirmatively requires that the combined disclosure be <em data-original="E-03">accurate at the time at which payment is made</em> (emphasis added). Such a requirement would be superfluous if the combined disclosure could be provided after payment because a disclosure provided after payment must accurately reflect the terms of the completed transaction pursuant to EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B). Accordingly, the Bureau believes the statute requires both the pre-payment disclosure and the combined disclosure be given prior to payment.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed below in § 1005.36, special timing rules have been adopted for preauthorized remittance transfers to account for the particular challenges associated with providing disclosures for transfers that may occur far in the future. Therefore, proposed § 205.31(e)(1) is adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(e)(1), with modifications to reference new § 1005.36. Section 1005.31(e)(1) states that except as provided in § 1005.36(a), a pre-payment disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(1) or a combined disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(3) must be provided to the sender when the sender requests the remittance transfer, but prior to payment for the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(e)-1 clarified when a sender has requested a remittance transfer, for purposes of determining when a pre-payment or combined disclosure must be provided. The proposed comment is adopted substantially as proposed, with a reference to the provisions for preauthorized remittance transfers in new § 1005.36. Comment 31(e)-1 states that, except as provided in § 1005.36(a), pre-payment and combined disclosures are required to be provided to the sender when the sender requests the remittance transfer, but prior to payment for the transfer. The comment clarifies that whether a consumer has requested a remittance transfer depends on the facts and circumstances. A sender that asks a provider to send a remittance transfer, and that provides transaction-specific information to the provider in order to send funds to a designated recipient, has requested a remittance transfer. For example, a sender who asks the provider to send money to a recipient in Mexico and provides the sender and recipient information to the provider has requested the remittance transfer provider to send a remittance transfer. In contrast, a consumer who solely inquires about that day's rates and fees to send to Mexico has not requested the remittance transfer provider to send a remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>31(e)(2) Timing of Receipts</title>
              <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B) requires that a receipt be provided to a sender at the time the sender makes payment in connection with the remittance transfer. Proposed § 205.31(e)(2) provided that a receipt must be provided to the sender when payment is made for the transaction. The Bureau did not receive comment on this proposed provision. Under the final rule, a receipt required to be provided by § 1005.31(b)(2) generally must be provided to the sender when payment is made for the remittance transfer, except for preauthorized remittance transfers as provided in § 1005.36(a). The Bureau notes that the final rule does not require the receipt to be provided at an exact moment when the sender, for example, hands cash or a credit card to an agent to pay for the transfer. Rather, the Bureau believes that payment for a remittance transfer is a process that may involve several steps. For example, payment for a transfer by credit card could involve a sender handing a credit card to an agent, the agent asking the sender for identification, the agent sending the credit card authorization request, the card authorization being approved, the agent requesting signature on a credit card receipt, and the sender signing the credit card receipt.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(e)-2 provided examples of when a remittance transfer provider may provide the sender a receipt. The Bureau did not receive comment on the proposed comment, which is adopted substantially as proposed. Comment 31(e)-2 in the final rule, however, adds a reference to the special timing rules for preauthorized remittance transfers in § 1005.36. The comment also adds a clarification regarding when a payment is made for purposes of the final rule, including an example stating that, for purposes of subpart B, payment is made when a sender authorizes a payment. The Bureau believes that, for purposes of subpart B, payment is made when a sender authorizes payment because a receipt will be most useful to a sender at that time. Otherwise, if payment is considered to be made when the funds actually leave the sender's account due to delays in processing a payment, a receipt may not be provided to a sender for a day or more. Furthermore, it is not clear how a sender's cancellation right would operate in this scenario. For example, because a sender does not know when funds leave an account, a sender would be unable to know when the cancellation right would be triggered.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(e)-2 in the final rule states that except as provided in § 1005.36(a), a receipt required by § 1005.31(b)(2) must be provided to the sender when payment is made for the remittance transfer. For example, a remittance transfer provider could give the sender the disclosures after the sender pays for the remittance transfer in person, but before the sender leaves the counter. A provider could also give the sender the disclosures immediately before the sender pays for the transaction. For purposes of subpart B, payment is made, for example, when a sender provides cash to the remittance transfer provider or when payment is authorized.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(e)(2) further stated that if a transaction is conducted entirely by telephone, a written receipt may be mailed or delivered to the sender no later than one business day after the date on which payment is made for the remittance transfer. If a transaction is conducted entirely by telephone and involves the transfer of funds from the sender's account held by the provider, the written receipt may be provided on or with the next regularly scheduled periodic statement. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> EFTA section 919(a)(5)(B). In some circumstances, a provider conducting such a transfer from the sender's account held by the provider is not required to provide a periodic statement under other laws. The Board believed that in such circumstances, it would be appropriate to permit the provider to provide a written receipt within a similar period of time as a periodic statement. Therefore, pursuant to EFTA section 904(c), the Board also proposed in § 205.31(e)(2) that the written receipt may be provided within 30 days after payment is made for the remittance transfer if a periodic statement is not required. Under the proposal, in order for the written receipt to be mailed or delivered to a sender conducting a transaction entirely by telephone at these later times, the remittance transfer provider was required to comply with the foreign language requirements of proposed § 205.31(g)(3).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter argued that the Bureau should include a timing exception in circumstances where a receipt is required to be provided to a sender shortly before a periodic statement is produced. This commenter stated that a remittance transfer provider may not be able to provide the required disclosures to a sender for a remittance transfer that occurs at the end of a billing cycle in time to include in the statement. The commenter suggested that in such circumstances, the Bureau should permit the receipt to be provided by the later of the next periodic statement date or 30 days after payment. The Bureau believes the final rule gives providers sufficient time to provide a receipt to a sender after a remittance transfer is sent; thus, no accommodation for transfers made at the end of a billing cycle is included in § 1005.31(e)(2). Because periodic statements must include certain information that occurs during a cycle, <em data-original="E-03">see</em> § 1005.9(b), the Bureau expects that, for purposes unrelated to this rule, providers already delay sending a periodic statement for a short time after a cycle ends to ensure that all activity occurring within a cycle is included in the appropriate statement.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and to facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA section 904(a) and (c) to adopt the provisions regarding mailing a receipt in proposed § 205.31(e)(2) as § 1005.31(e)(2) with revisions. Section 1005.31(e)(2) in the final rule eliminates the requirement to comply with proposed § 205.31(g)(3), because the provision has been eliminated in the final rule, as discussed in further detail below. Section 1005.31(e)(2) is also revised to state that if a transaction is conducted entirely by telephone and involves the transfer of funds from the sender's account held by the provider, the receipt may be provided within 30 days after payment is made for the remittance transfer if a periodic statement is not <em data-original="E-03">provided,</em> rather than if a periodic statement is not required. In some circumstances, a provider may provide a sender with a periodic statement even if one is not required to be provided. In these circumstances, the Bureau believes a provider should instead disclose the receipt on or with the periodic statement and that the provision allowing a provider to give a receipt 30 days after payment is made should not apply.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(e)(2) is further revised to account for circumstances in which a provider discloses the statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv), in order to use the telephone exceptions pursuant to § 1005.31(a)(3)(iii) or (a)(5)(iii). In those circumstances, the Bureau does not believe a provider should be required to repeat the statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation on a receipt when it has already been disclosed to the sender. Thus, pursuant to the Bureau's authority under EFTA section 919(d)(3), § 1005.31(e)(2) states that the statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) may, but need not, be disclosed pursuant to the timing requirements of § 1005.31(e)(2) if a provider discloses this information pursuant to § 1005.31(a)(3)(iii) or (a)(5)(iii). The Bureau also adds comment 31(e)(2)-5 to clarify that even though the statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation need not be disclosed pursuant to the timing requirements of § 1005.31(e)(2), the statement about the rights of the sender regarding error resolution required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) must be disclosed pursuant to the timing requirements of § 1005.31(e)(2).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(e)-3 provided further clarification regarding circumstances where a sender transfers funds from his or her account, as defined by § 205.2(b) (currently § 1005.2(b)), that is held by the remittance transfer provider. The Bureau did not receive comment on proposed comment 31(e)-3, which is adopted substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is providing further guidance in the final rule regarding the timing of receipts for remittance transfers made via mobile application or text message. As discussed above, because remittance transfers sent via mobile application or text message are conducted entirely by mobile telephone, the Bureau believes that EFTA section 919(a)(5)(A) permits pre-payment disclosures to be provided orally for such transfers. Similarly, the Bureau believes that that EFTA section 919(a)(5)(B) permits receipts for transfers sent entirely by telephone via mobile application or text message to be provided in accordance with the mailing rules provided for transactions conducted entirely by telephone in § 1005.31(e)(2) or § 1005.36(a). Therefore, the final rule adds a new comment 31(e)-4 to clarify that if a transaction is conducted entirely by telephone via mobile application or text message, a receipt required by § 1005.31(b)(2) may be mailed or delivered to the sender pursuant to the timing requirements in § 1005.31(e)(2) or § 1005.36(a). For example, if a sender conducts a transfer entirely by telephone via mobile application, a remittance transfer provider may mail or deliver the disclosures to a sender pursuant to the timing requirements in § 1005.31(e)(2) or § 1005.36(a).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Finally, several industry commenters requested that the Bureau specifically permit remittance transfer providers to provide receipts for transactions conducted via mobile application or text message by email or through a provider's Web site. The Bureau notes that written receipts provided in accordance with § 1005.31(e)(2) or § 1005.36(a) may be provided electronically, subject to compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 31(a)(2)-1.</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(d) provided that estimated disclosures may be provided to the extent permitted by proposed § 205.32. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> proposed § 205.32, adopted as § 1005.32, below. The proposed rule provided that such disclosures must be described as estimates, using the term “Estimated,” or a substantially similar term, in close proximity to the estimated term or terms described. As discussed in the proposal, consumer testing participants generally understood that where the term “estimated” was used in close proximity to the estimated term or terms, the actual amount could vary (for example, the amount of currency to be received could be higher or lower than the amount disclosed). Proposed comment 31(d)-1 provided examples of terms that may be used to indicate that a disclosed amount is estimated. For instance, a remittance transfer provider could describe an estimated disclosure as “Estimated Transfer Amount,” “Other Estimated Fees and Taxes,” or “Total to Recipient (Est.).” A Member of Congress and consumer group commenters agreed that the Bureau should require disclosures to be labeled as estimates when estimates are used. Therefore, proposed § 205.31(d) and proposed comment 31(d)-1 are adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(d) and comment 31(d)-1.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>31(g) Foreign Language Disclosures</title>
            <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(b) provides that disclosures required under EFTA section 919 must be made in English and in each of the foreign languages principally used by the remittance transfer provider, or any of its agents, to advertise, solicit, or market, either orally or in writing, at that office. The Board proposed § 205.31(g)(1) to implement EFTA section 919(b) for written or electronic disclosures generally, with some modifications as discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule. In addition, the Board proposed § 205.31(g)(2) and (3) to exempt from the general foreign language disclosure requirements oral disclosures and written receipts for telephone transactions. The Bureau is adopting § 205.31(g) in renumbered § 1005.31(g) generally as proposed with some changes in response to suggestions from commenters, as discussed in detail below.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisSection>
              <title>31(g)(1) General</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(g)(1) provided that disclosures required under subpart B, other than oral disclosures and written receipts for telephone transactions, must be made in English and in each of the foreign languages principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfer services, either orally, in writing, or electronically, at that office. Alternatively, proposed § 205.31(g)(1) provided that these disclosures may be made in English, and, if applicable, in the foreign language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction (or for written or electronic disclosures made pursuant to proposed § 205.33, in the foreign language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to assert the error), provided that such foreign language is principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfer services, either orally, in writing, or electronically, at that office.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, proposed § 205.31(g)(1) contained certain exceptions and clarifications to the requirements of EFTA section 919(b). Specifically, the Board proposed: (i) To apply the provisions only to written or electronic disclosures and address oral disclosures separately in proposed § 205.31(g)(2); (ii) to simplify the statutory language in EFTA section 919(b) by removing the term “or its agents;” (iii) to include electronic advertising, soliciting or marketing as a trigger to the foreign language disclosure requirements, in addition to oral and written advertisements, solicitations, or marketing; (iv) to limit the trigger to foreign language advertisements, solicitations, or marketing of remittance transfer services, and to exclude from the trigger foreign language advertisements, solicitations, or marketing of other products or services; and (v) to permit, under its EFTA section 904(c) authority, a remittance transfer provider to fulfill its obligations by providing the sender with disclosures in English and, if applicable, the one triggered foreign language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction or assert an error in lieu of providing disclosures in each of the triggered foreign languages.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Commenters did not object to these specific proposed modifications. However, several industry commenters stated that the foreign language disclosure requirements generally would provide a disincentive for remittance transfer providers to provide a wide range of foreign language services to customers. Some of these commenters suggested that if remittance transfer providers were to offer fewer foreign language services, this would drive some customers to use illicit operators who provide the foreign-language services discontinued by legitimate remittance transfer providers. Another commenter suggested that the disclosures should only be provided in English because the foreign language requirement would impose costs that would be passed on to consumers who might not derive any benefit from such services.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters and a member of Congress, however, thought the rule should ensure that non- and limited-English speaking consumers have access to meaningful remittance transfer disclosures. The Congressional commenter also agreed with the Board's proposal to extend the advertising, soliciting, or marketing trigger to electronic advertisements, solicitations, and marketing.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(b) requires disclosures to be provided in certain foreign languages, and the Bureau believes the Board's proposed modifications to the statutory requirements alleviates burden on remittance transfer providers. The Bureau believes that proposed § 205.31(g)(1) reflects a proper balancing of interests in providing non- and limited-English speaking consumers with disclosures in a language with which they are familiar with the burden on remittance transfer providers of providing multilingual disclosures in implementing EFTA section 919(b). The statute and the implementing regulation seek to ensure that if remittance transfer providers make a concerted effort to reach out to potential remittance transfer customers through advertisements, solicitations, and marketing in a foreign language in a particular office, then such providers should also be required to provide important disclosures in that language when such customers come to that office to purchase remittance transfer services from that provider or assert an error.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, the Bureau agrees with the Board's proposed modifications and clarifications to the statutory language for the reasons discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, and commenters did not object to such modifications and clarifications. Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA section 904(a) and (c) to adopt proposed § 205.31(g)(1) in renumbered § 1005.31(g)(1), with the removal of a reference to proposed § 205.31(g)(3) regarding written receipts for telephone transactions, which is further discussed below, and other minor technical and clarifying amendments. Most notably, the Bureau is changing the references to “that office” in the proposed rule to “the office in which a sender conducts a transaction or asserts an error” for clarity.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisSection>
                <title>Principally Used</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(g)(1)-1 clarified when a foreign language is principally used. As the Board stated in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the statute indicates that more than one foreign language may be principally used. Consequently, the Board's interpretation of the term “principally used” was not limited to the one foreign language used most frequently by the remittance transfer provider. Instead, proposed comment 31(g)(1)-1 adopted a facts-and-circumstances approach to determining when a foreign language is principally used. Under proposed comment 31(g)(1)-1, factors contributing to whether a foreign language is principally used would include: (i) The frequency with which the remittance transfer provider advertises, solicits, or markets remittance transfers in a foreign language at a particular office; (ii) the prominence of such advertising, soliciting, or marketing in that language at that office; and (iii) the specific foreign language terms used to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfer services at that office. Proposed comment 31(g)(1)-1 also included examples to illustrate when a foreign language is principally used and when there is incidental use of the language. As discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the Board also considered an objective standard based on whether a foreign language meets a certain percentage threshold of a remittance transfer provider's advertisements at a particular office. However, the Board rejected such a standard based on the fact that the standard may be arbitrary, may be difficult to administer, and may inappropriately exclude instances where a foreign language is principally used to advertise, solicit or market remittance transfers, even if the number of advertisements in the foreign language is nominally low.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters suggested that there be further clarification on the term “principally used,” but did not specifically state what kind of guidance would be helpful. A consumer group commenter agreed with the proposed facts-and-circumstances approach for determining foreign languages principally used in advertising, soliciting, or marketing remittance transfer services. A member of Congress agreed with the Board's interpretation that the statutory provision contemplated that more than one foreign language could be principally used.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with the Board's reasoning in proposing comment 31(g)(1)-1. Because the Bureau believes the particular facts and circumstances surrounding the use of a foreign language to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers will determine whether a foreign language is “principally used” to advertise, solicit, or market at a particular office, the Bureau does not believe further general statements would be helpful. However, the Bureau is amending one of the illustrative examples in comment 31(g)(1)-1 to provide a more clear example of when a remittance transfer provider would be considered to be principally using a foreign language to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers at an office.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>Advertise, Solicit, or Market</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Neither the EFTA nor Regulation E defines “advertising,” “soliciting,” or “marketing.”<footnote ref="77">Regulation E contains some guidance on whether a card, code, or other device is “marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate” or “marketed to the general public” for purposes of the requirements pertaining to gift cards. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; comments 20(b)(2)-2, 20(b)(2)-3, and 20(b)(4)-1. However, that guidance focuses on a narrow set of circumstances and does not address more broadly what actions generally constitute advertising, soliciting, or marketing.</footnote>
                  However, the general concept of advertising, soliciting, or marketing is explained in other regulations administered by the Bureau. <em data-original="E-03">See, e.g.,</em> Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.2(a)(2) and associated commentary; Regulation DD, 12 CFR 1030.2(b) and 1030.11(b) and associated commentary.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed comment 31(g)(1)-2 to provide positive and negative examples of advertising, soliciting, or marketing in a foreign language. These examples were based on examples from the commentary to other regulations (specifically, renumbered §§ 1026.2(a)(2) and 1030.2(b)) regarding the definition of “advertisement,” as well as examples related to the promotion of overdrafts under § 1030.11(b). Some industry commenters asked whether the terms “market” and “solicit” mean something different than “advertise” and requested definitions for “market” or “solicit” if they are meant to have different meanings. The Bureau believes, that for purposes of subpart B of Regulation E, the terms “advertise,” “solicit” and “market” have the same general meaning, and comment 31(g)(1)-2 is adopted substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisSection>
                <title>At the Office</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Under EFTA section 919(b) and proposed § 205.31(g)(1), foreign language disclosures would be required when the foreign language is principally used to advertise, solicit, or market “at that office.” As discussed above, the Bureau is changing the reference in § 1005.31(g)(1) from “that office” to “the office in which a sender conducts a transaction or asserts an error” for clarity in the final rule. The Board proposed comment 31(g)(1)-3 to clarify the meaning of “office.” As discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, proposed 31(g)(1)-3 reflected the Board's belief that an office includes both physical and non-physical locations where remittance transfer services are offered to consumers, including any telephone number or Web site through which a consumer can complete a transaction or assert an error. The Board further noted that a telephone number or Web site that provides general information about the remittance transfer provider, but through which a consumer does not have the ability to complete a transaction or assert an error, is not an office. Proposed comment 31(g)(1)-3 also clarified that a location need not exclusively offer remittance transfer services in order to be considered an office for purposes of § 1005.31(g)(1) (proposed as § 205.31(g)(1)), and included an example to illustrate this point.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters requested clarification on whether a Web site targeted to consumers outside of the United States could be an “office” for purposes of the foreign language disclosure requirements. In response, the Bureau is revising comment 31(g)(1)-3 to clarify that because a consumer must be located in a State to be considered a “sender” under § 1005.30(g), a Web site is not an “office,” even if the Web site can be accessed by consumers that are located in the United States, unless a sender may conduct a remittance transfer on the Web site or may assert an error for a remittance transfer on the Web site. Therefore, a Web site that is targeted to people outside of the United States will not be deemed to be an “office” for purposes of § 1005.31(g) so long as senders cannot conduct a remittance transfer on the Web site or assert an error for a remittance transfer on the Web site.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Board also proposed comment 31(g)(1)-4 to provide guidance on the phrase “at that office.” Proposed comment 31(g)(1)-4 stated that advertisements, solicitations, or marketing posted, provided, or made at a physical office, on a Web site of a remittance transfer provider, or during a telephone call with the remittance transfer provider would constitute advertising, soliciting, or marketing at an office of a remittance transfer provider. The proposed comment also clarified that for error resolution disclosures, the relevant office would be the office in which the sender first asserts the error and not the office where the remittance transfer was conducted.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter requested clarification on a number of situations where the remittance transfer provider may be engaging in general advertising, marketing, or soliciting that is not intended to be made at a particular office, but due to the nature of such advertising, marketing, or soliciting, it happens to occur at a particular office. The Bureau agrees that such a clarification is appropriate and has revised comment 31(g)(1)-4 to state that an advertisement, solicitation, or marketing that is considered to be made at an office does not include general advertisements, solicitations, or marketing that are not intended to be made at a particular office. The proposed comment includes an example to illustrate this concept. Specifically, if an advertisement for remittance transfers in Chinese appears in a Chinese newspaper that is being distributed at a grocery store in which the agent of a remittance transfer provider is located, such advertisement would not be considered to be made at that office.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also amending comment 31(g)(1)-4 to provide that advertisements, soliciting, or marketing posted, provided, or made via mobile application or text message would also be considered advertising, soliciting, or marketing at an office of a remittance transfer provider. The amendment is consistent with the Bureau's other revisions in the final rule clarifying that transfers through mobile application or text message are considered to be transfers conducted by telephone. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(a)(5). The Bureau is also making other minor amendments to comment 31(g)(1)-4 for additional clarity, including changing “that office” to “the office in which a sender conducts a transaction or asserts an error” to be consistent with the change the Bureau is adopting in § 1005.31(g)(1). Based on this change, comment 31(g)(1)-4 also contains a clarification that for disclosures required under § 1005.31, the relevant office would be the office in which the sender conducts the transaction.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisParagraph>In the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the Board proposed to use its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to exempt oral disclosures from the foreign language requirement under EFTA section 919(b). In proposed § 205.31(g)(2), the Board proposed to use its authority under EFTA section 919(a)(5)(A) to permit oral disclosures for transactions conducted entirety by telephone, subject to the requirement that they be made in the language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction. Proposed § 205.31(g)(2) also provided that disclosures permitted to be provided orally under proposed § 205.31(a)(4) for error resolution purposes must be made in the language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to assert the error.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters thought that the rule should not require disclosures in any foreign language that is not principally used to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers. These commenters suggested that such a requirement could hurt consumers by reducing the number of languages that a remittance transfer provider would be willing to use to conduct a transaction.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>However, as the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, if a foreign language must be principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers in order to trigger the foreign language requirement for oral disclosures, a sender conducting a transaction or asserting an error in a foreign language on the telephone that did not meet the foreign language advertising trigger may only receive required oral disclosures in English. Consequently, if the remittance transfer provider conducted the actual transaction or communicated with the sender regarding the alleged error in a foreign language, a remittance transfer provider could then switch to English to orally disclose the required information under such a rule. The Bureau believes that senders would benefit from having the required oral disclosures provided in the same language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction or assert the error, regardless of whether the language meets the foreign language advertising trigger. Failure to include this modification from the general foreign language requirement for oral disclosures could lead to consumers not understanding the required disclosures, which would be contrary to the goals and purposes of the statute.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, the Bureau agrees with the Board's reasoning in the May 2011 Proposed Rule that disclosures provided orally under § 1005.31(a)(3) and (4) should be provided only in the language primarily used to conduct the transaction or assert the error. Otherwise, under EFTA section 919(b), a sender conducting a telephone transaction orally or receiving the results of an error investigation orally could be given disclosures in English and in every foreign language triggered by the regulation, which would likely lead to consumer confusion. While the Bureau recognizes that this rule might reduce the languages in which a remittance transfer provider would be willing to conduct a transaction, the Bureau believes that applying the general foreign language disclosure rule to oral disclosures would be harmful to consumers for the reasons set forth above.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Moreover, as discussed above, the Bureau is adopting § 1005.31(a)(5) to permit disclosures to be provided orally or via mobile application or text message for transactions conducted entirely by telephone via mobile application or text message. Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to adopt proposed § 205.31(g)(2) in renumbered § 1005.31(g)(2) with amendments to include a reference to transactions conducted entirely by telephone via mobile application or text message and other minor, non-substantive amendments.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisSection>
                <title>Written Receipt for Telephone Transactions</title>
                <analysisParagraph>The Board also proposed § 205.31(g)(3), which provided that written receipts for transactions conducted entirely by telephone must be made in English and, if applicable, in the foreign language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction, regardless of whether such foreign language is primarily used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers. The Board, however, requested comment on whether the general rule proposed in § 205.31(g)(1) (adopted as § 1005.31(g)(1) above) should apply to the written receipt provided for transactions conducted entirely by telephone. Adopting the general rule proposed in § 205.31(g)(1) for written receipts provided for transactions conducted entirely by telephone would mean that a remittance transfer provider would not be obligated to provide the written receipt in a foreign language, even if such foreign language was used to conduct the telephone transaction, unless the foreign language was principally used to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers during the telephone call.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As noted above, some industry commenters thought that the rule should not require disclosures in any foreign language that is not principally used to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers because this might cause remittance transfer providers to reduce the number of languages they would be willing to use to conduct a remittance transfer. Another industry commenter stated that in its experience, consumers can understand written English even though they may prefer to conduct a transaction orally in their native language for the fluency, ease, and speed at which the transaction may be conducted when speaking in one's native language.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that applying the general rule under § 1005.31(g)(1) to written receipts provided to senders after payment would not cause the same type of consumer confusion as it would for pre-payment disclosures provided orally in transactions conducted entirely by telephone. Although some senders may not have enough familiarity with English to feel comfortable speaking with the remittance transfer provider in English, the same pressure to comprehend and respond quickly does not exist with written disclosures. Unlike with oral disclosures, senders have sufficient time to review written disclosures and, if necessary, find resources to help understand the disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, the Bureau notes that in the Board's outreach with industry, remittance transfer providers generally stated that providing written disclosures in a foreign language can be more costly and burdensome than providing oral disclosures in a foreign language. The Bureau also notes that a remittance transfer provider may have employees or agents that happen to speak a certain foreign language for which the provider does not have written disclosures. The Bureau would not want providers to discourage such employees or agents from using their foreign language skills to help senders with their remittance transfer transactions in order to avoid having to provide written disclosures in the language spoken by the employee or agent. In order to minimize the potential unintended consequence of having remittance transfer providers reduce the number of foreign languages they may offer for telephone transactions, the Bureau is not adopting proposed § 205.31(g)(3). Therefore, written receipts required to be provided to the sender after payment for transactions conducted entirely by telephone are subject to the general rule under § 1005.31(g)(1).</analysisParagraph>

                <title>General Clarifications</title>
                <analysisParagraph>The Board also proposed additional commentary in the May 2011 Proposed Rule to provide general guidance on issues that affect each of the subsections of proposed § 205.31(g) (adopted as § 1005.31(g)) discussed above. EFTA section 919(b) does not limit the number of languages that may be used on a single disclosure. However, proposed comment 31(g)-1 suggested that a single written or electronic document containing more than three languages is not likely to be helpful to a consumer. Since the proposed commentary was not a strict limit, the Board solicited comment on whether the regulation should strictly limit the number of languages that may be contained in a single written or electronic disclosure. The Board also sought comment on whether three languages is an appropriate suggested limit to the number of languages in a single written or electronic document.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter suggested that the rule cap the number of languages a remittance transfer provider would be required to disclose to three languages. The commenter also stated that requiring English, Spanish, and French would cover the vast majority of the languages used in transfers they send from the United States. This commenter also noted that other regulators that have required foreign language disclosures have typically limited the languages that must be disclosed to either English and Spanish, or a small subset of languages such as Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, and Korean. A consumer group commenter recommended that rather than adopting a ceiling on the number of languages that may appear on a disclosure, the Bureau should create guidelines that ensure disclosures with multiple foreign languages are easy to understand.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe that limiting the foreign languages that may be used by a remittance transfer provider best effectuates the goals of the statute. In the Bureau's view, if a remittance transfer provider principally uses a foreign language to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers at an office, the remittance transfer provider is deliberately reaching out to consumers speaking that foreign language, and the required disclosures should be provided in that foreign language, regardless of whether it is a language that is commonly used for remittance transfers originating in the United States. Furthermore, while too many languages on a single written document may diminish a consumer's ability to read and understand the disclosures, the Bureau believes that remittance transfer providers may find ways to present the information in a number of foreign languages that are clear and conspicuous to senders, and that imposing a definitive limit on the number of languages that may appear on a single disclosure may be too inflexible. Moreover, the Bureau believes that the formatting requirements in § 1005.31(c), as discussed above, may help to ensure that senders can find and understand the information that is most important to them with respect to the remittance transfer. The Bureau is amending comment 31(g)-1 to note that disclosures must be clear and conspicuous pursuant to § 1005.31(a)(1) without suggesting a specific limit on the number of languages in a single disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(g)-1 also clarified that the remittance transfer provider may provide disclosures in a single document with both languages or in two separate documents with one document in English and the other document in the applicable foreign language. The Board also proposed several examples in comment 31(g)-1 to illustrate the application of this concept.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters thought that senders should be able to designate the language in which they prefer to receive disclosures, provided it is a language that is principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers, instead of providing disclosures in both English and the applicable foreign language. The Bureau notes that EFTA section 919(b) requires disclosures to be provided in English and in each of the foreign languages principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market at that office. This means that regardless of which office a sender chooses to conduct a remittance transfer, he or she will always obtain written or electronic disclosures in English, even if the disclosure in a foreign language is not consistent among different offices because such disclosure will depend on whether the foreign language meets the foreign language disclosure trigger at that office. The Bureau believes that always disclosing in English is important to allow senders to compare disclosures received at different provider locations and for different providers. Therefore, the final rule requires remittance transfer providers to provide disclosures in English in all cases. This is fully consistent with EFTA section 919(b). Comment 31(g)-1 is adopted as proposed with some technical and clarifying amendments, including to remove references to § 205.31(g)(3), consistent with the Bureau's decision regarding written receipts for telephone transactions, as discussed above.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Board also proposed comment 31(g)-2 to clarify when a language is primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct a transaction and assert an error. A remittance transfer provider must determine the language that is primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct a transaction or assert an error if the provider chooses to provide written or electronic disclosures in English and the foreign language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction or to assert an error. Furthermore, under § 1005.31(g)(2), a remittance transfer provider is required to provide oral disclosures in the language that is primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction or assert an error.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Specifically, proposed comment 31(g)-2 clarified that the language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction is the primary language used to convey the information necessary to complete the transaction. Proposed comment 31(g)-2 also stated that the language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to assert an error is the primary language used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to provide the information required by § 1005.33(b) to assert an error. The proposed comment also provided examples to clarify this concept.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter suggested that the foreign language disclosure requirement should relate to the language used by the remittance transfer provider, rather than the language used by the sender. Some industry commenters recommended that the Bureau provide further clarification of the term “primarily used” without specifying what type of guidance would be helpful. The Bureau notes that proposed comment 31(g)-2 specifies that the relevant foreign language is the foreign language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct a transaction or assert an error, and the examples show that a foreign language must be used by both the sender and the remittance transfer provider to be primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct a transaction or assert an error. The Bureau believes the proposed commentary is clear on this point. However, as additional clarification, the Bureau is including a new example in comment 31(g)-2 to illustrate when a sender primarily uses a foreign language with a remittance transfer provider in the internet context.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>Storefront and Internet Disclosures</title>
                <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(6)(A) states that the Bureau may prescribe rules to require a remittance transfer provider to prominently post, and timely update, a notice describing a model remittance transfer for one or more amounts. The provision states that such a notice shall show the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient, using the values of the currency into which the funds will be exchanged. EFTA section 919(a)(6)(A) also states that the Bureau may require the notice prescribed to be displayed in every physical storefront location owned or controlled by the remittance transfer provider. Further, EFTA section 919(a)(6)(A) states that the Bureau shall prescribe rules to require a remittance transfer provider that provides remittance transfers via the internet to provide a notice, comparable to the storefront notice described in the statute, located on the home page or landing page (with respect to such remittance transfer services) owned or controlled by the remittance transfer provider.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(6)(B) states that, prior to proposing rules under EFTA section 919(a)(6)(A), appropriate studies and analyses must be performed to determine whether a storefront notice or internet notice facilitates the ability of a consumer to: (i) Compare prices for remittance transfers, and (ii) understand the types and amounts of any fees or costs imposed on remittance transfers. The studies and analyses must be consistent with EFTA section 904(a)(2), which requires an economic impact analysis that considers the costs and benefits of a regulation to financial institutions, consumers, and other users. These costs and benefits include the extent to which additional paperwork would be required, the effects upon competition in the provision of services among large and small financial institutions, and the availability of services to different classes of consumers, particularly low income consumers.<footnote ref="78">As discussed below, the Board performed an analysis in the proposed rule consistent with EFTA section 904(a)(2), as it existed prior to any amendments in the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 904(a)(2), however, did not apply and was not amended by the Dodd-Frank Act to apply to the Bureau. Regardless, the Board's analysis from the proposal is unchanged, and the Bureau concurs with the Board's analysis.</footnote></analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Consistent with EFTA section 919(a)(6)(B), the Board reviewed and analyzed the statute and a variety of independent articles, studies, and Congressional testimony; conducted outreach with industry and consumer advocates; and held focus groups with consumers who send remittance transfers. Based on its findings, summarized below, the Board concluded in the May 2011 Proposed Rule that the statutory notice would not facilitate a consumer's ability to compare prices or to understand the fees and costs imposed on remittance transfers.<footnote ref="79">A complete discussion of the Board's findings is available at 76 FR at 29924-29927.</footnote></analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The notice described by the statute illustrates only the exchange rate offered by that remittance transfer provider for the particular model transfer amount. In addition to the exchange rate, however, the total cost of a remittance transfer includes fees charged by the remittance transfer provider, any intermediary in the transfer, and the receiving entity. The total cost also includes any taxes that may be charged in the sending and receiving jurisdictions. Thus, the Board determined the statutory storefront notice would not present a complete picture to the consumer of all potential fees and costs for a remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In the proposal, the Board considered two alternatives to the type of notice described in the statute that could more effectively communicate costs to a sender. The Board considered requiring the posting of transfer fee information for model send amounts, but believed that this alternative notice would have many of the same limitations as the statutory notice. The Board also considered requiring a notice that would reflect all the costs of a transfer. A notice with this alternative content could help consumers to obtain a better understanding of the total cost of a remittance transfer, but the length and complexity of such notices could limit their utility.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The analysis conducted by the Board identified other limitations with both the statutory and alternative storefront disclosures. First, most consumers would be unable to apply the information provided by the statutory notice to their own transfers. The fees, exchange rate, and taxes for a remittance transfer can vary based upon the amount sent, transfer corridor (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the sending location to the receiving location), speed of transfer (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> the next day, the same day, or in one hour), method of delivery (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> an electronic deposit into a bank account or a cash disbursement), and type of receiving entity (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> a bank or a money transmitter's payout partner). For example, some remittance transfer providers offer a discount on their exchange rate spread for large send amounts. Therefore, even if the consumer's transfer were identical to the model transfer posted in the storefront notice except for the send amount, the consumer still may be unable to determine the exchange rate that would apply to the consumer's transfer based on the storefront notice.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Moreover, a consumer could be overwhelmed by the amount of data appearing in a long, complex storefront notice posted by these providers and, therefore, might not use it. A storefront notice for sending a specified amount to a single country could contain multiple rows of information to account for differences in pricing based on the transfer method, timing option, receipt location, and cost permutations described above. Many providers offer remittance transfers to multiple countries, and several locations within each country, which would multiply the number of data points on the notice.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Finally, frequent fluctuations in exchange rates could result in disclosures being inaccurate for a period of time. Remittance transfer providers would have to update the storefront notice for each send location several times a week, or as frequently as several times a day, to account for the fluctuations in exchange rates. These rates could also be different at a single provider's different send locations. Remittance transfer providers would need to distribute the updated notices to each send location, and each send location would need to replace the outdated notice just as frequently. Non-exclusive send locations that offer the services of two or more money transmitters would have to post and update the storefront notices for each remittance transfer provider. As a result, a storefront notice could be unhelpful and even misleading to consumers, while creating unnecessary legal risks for remittance transfer providers.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The analysis also identified potential effects that the storefront notice requirement would have on competition and costs to the consumer. The work involved in posting and updating storefront notices could cause some agents to stop offering remittance transfers. Further, credit unions and small banks that infrequently conduct transfers could find the burden and cost of producing storefront notices prohibitive and discontinue the service. Given the costs and risks associated with posting and updating the storefront notices contemplated by the statute, some providers could decide to exit the market, which could reduce competition among providers and increase costs for consumers.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Because the Board did not propose a rule mandating the posting of storefront notices, it did not propose a rule mandating the posting of internet notices. Since the proposal did not require a storefront notice, there could be no “comparable” internet notice. Moreover, the Board's study of model internet notices indicated that consumers using internet remittance transfer providers to request remittance transfers would be less likely to use a model transfer notice than those using providers at a physical location. Many internet providers currently disclose transaction-specific information prior to the consumer's payment for a transfer, and § 1005.31(b)(1), discussed above, makes this practice a regulatory requirement.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters supported the findings that the storefront notice and internet notice would not be useful to consumers. One consumer group commenter believed that the Bureau should require any storefront advertising to be in a storefront disclosure format prescribed by the Bureau. The commenter argued that the storefront disclosure should include the amount a sender pays to a remittance transfer provider and the amount to be received by a recipient for at least two sample amounts. The commenter suggested that disclosures could be based on the cost at a certain time, such as the previous business day, to alleviate the concerns about disclosures needing to be updated more frequently.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with the Board's analysis, and believes that the storefront and internet disclosures described in EFTA section 919(a)(6)(A) would not accomplish the statutory goals of facilitating the ability of consumers to compare prices for remittance transfers and to understand the types and amounts of any fees or costs imposed on remittance transfers. The disclosures would not provide a complete disclosure of all of the costs of a remittance transfer. Even if all costs were provided in the disclosures, consumers would be unable to extrapolate from a storefront disclosure the cost of their particular transaction, because the cost could depend on other variables. The Bureau also recognizes the burden on remittance transfer providers could be significant and could lead some providers to no longer provide remittance services. The burden on providers would be substantial even if the disclosures were only required to be updated daily. Moreover, requiring less frequent updating would result in the disclosures being inaccurate for a period of time.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Because the cost to providers could be substantial, and the benefit of the storefront and internet disclosures would be minimal, the final rule does not require the posting of model remittance transfer notices at a storefront or on the internet.</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(f) provided that the disclosures required by proposed § 205.31(b) must be accurate when a sender pays for the remittance transfer, except when estimates are permitted by proposed § 205.32. Proposed comment 31(f)-1 clarified that a remittance transfer provider did not have to guarantee the terms of the remittance transfer in the disclosures required by § 205.31(b) for any specific period of time. However, if any of the disclosures required by proposed § 205.31(b) are not accurate when a sender pays for the remittance transfer, a provider would be required to give new disclosures before receiving payment for the remittance transfer. For example, a sender at a retail store may be provided a pre-payment disclosure under proposed § 205.31(b)(1) at a customer service desk, but the sender may decide to leave the desk to go shopping. Upon the sender's return to the customer service desk an hour later, the sender would have to be provided a new pre-payment disclosure if any of the information had changed. However, the sender would not need to be provided a new disclosure if the information had not changed.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters supported the requirement that disclosures must be accurate when payment is made. An industry trade association commenter asked the Bureau to permit remittance transfer providers to include a statement in the disclosures clarifying that changes to the disclosures may occur between the time of payment and the time a transaction clears. However, the Bureau notes that under the proposed rule, only disclosures provided before payment is made would not be guaranteed and thus subject to change. Disclosures provided on receipts generally would be guaranteed, and thus not subject to change, except where estimates are permitted.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(f) is adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(f).

            <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(f) of the 2012 Final Rule states that except as provided in § 1005.36(b), disclosures required by this section must be accurate when a sender makes payment for the remittance transfer, except to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32.  In light of the new disclaimer required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii), as well as the optional disclosures under that paragraph, the Bureau is making conforming edits to § 1005.31(f) and comment 31(f)-1 to note that the disclosures required by § 1005.31(b) or permitted by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) must be accurate when a sender makes payment for the remittance transfer, except to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32.  Comment 31(f)-1 further notes that while a remittance transfer provider is not required to guarantee the terms of the remittance transfer in the disclosures required or permitted by § 1005.31(b) for any specific period of time, if any of the disclosures required or permitted by § 1005.31(b) are not accurate when a sender makes payment for the remittance transfer, a provider must give new disclosures before accepting payment.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that extending the accuracy requirement to the optional disclosures regarding non-covered third party fees and taxes collected by persons other than the remittance transfer provider is necessary in order to communicate accurately to the sender how confident the remittance transfer provider is concerning the information provided.  As discussed above, the Bureau believes that such information can be useful to senders under certain circumstances and hopes to encourage use of increasingly reliable information over time.  Although the vast majority of remittance transfer providers may choose to disclose any numbers provided as estimates due to the various uncertainties with regard to foreign taxes and fees discussed above, the Bureau believes it is important to preserve remittance transfer providers' ability to compete based on disclosure of actual figures.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>31(b)(1)(viii) Statements That Non-Covered Third-Party Fees or Taxes Collected on the Remittance Transfer by a Person Other Than the Provider May Apply</title>
                <analysisParagraph>In the December Proposal, the Bureau solicited comment on methods to reduce the burden of required disclosures of fees and taxes imposed on remittance transfers by persons other than the providers and alternative disclosures that could be provided.  Several industry and consumer group commenters suggested that in place of requiring exact or estimated disclosures of recipient institution fees or foreign taxes, the Bureau could require a statement within the disclosure forms alerting senders that the total amount received may be reduced by recipient institution fees or foreign taxes.  These commenters contended that such a disclosure would ensure that senders are aware of the potential for further reductions in the disclosed amount received, due to fees or taxes that are not disclosed, and would encourage senders and recipients to investigate the fees associated with a transfer to the recipient's financial institution, as compared to those associated with other mechanisms for sending a remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Although the Bureau is eliminating the requirement to calculate and disclose non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider, the Bureau strongly believes that it is nonetheless important to inform senders when fees and taxes that are not disclosed may apply to the remittance transfer.  Accordingly, to further the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes that it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to add § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii), which requires that a provider include, as applicable, a statement indicating that non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider may apply to the remittance transfer and result in the designated recipient receiving less than the amount disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii).  Moreover, under this paragraph, a provider may, but is not required to, disclose any applicable non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider using the language set for in Model Forms A-30(b)-(d) of Appendix A to this part or substantially similar language.  Any such figures must be disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be received, using the language set forth in Model Forms A-30(b) through (d) of Appendix A to this part, as appropriate, or substantially similar language.  The exchange rate used to calculate any disclosed non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider is the exchange rate used in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by § 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate.  Although new § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) makes the disclosure of the amount of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the provider optional, the Bureau believes that providers may be motivated to collect and disclose such information voluntarily, in the interest of providing high levels of customer service to senders and to better compete for remittance business against other providers.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>New comment 31(b)(1)(viii)-1 clarifies that if non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider apply to a particular remittance transfer, or if a provider does not know if such fees or taxes may apply to a particular remittance transfer, § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) requires the provider to include the disclaimer with respect to such fees and taxes.  Comment 31(b)(1)(viii)-1 additionally clarifies that required disclosures under § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) may only be provided to the extent applicable.  For example, if the designated recipient's institution is an agent of the provider and thus, non-covered third-party fees cannot apply to the transfer, the provider must disclose all fees imposed on the remittance transfer and may not provide the disclaimer regarding non-covered third-party fees.  In this scenario, the commentary clarifies, the provider may only provide the disclaimer regarding taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, as applicable.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>New comment 31(b)(1)(viii)-2 explains that § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) permits a provider to disclose the amount of any non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider.  For example, when a remittance transfer provider knows that the designated recipient's institution imposes a fee or that a foreign tax will apply, the provider may choose to disclose the relevant fee or tax as part of the information disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii).  The comment also notes that § 1005.32(b)(3) permits the provider to disclose estimated amounts of such taxes and fees, provided any estimates are based on reasonable source of information. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 32(b)(3)-1.  It further provides that where the provider chooses, at its option, to disclose the amounts of the relevant recipient institution fee or tax as part of the information disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii), the provider must not include that fee or tax in the amounts disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) or (b)(1)(vii).</analysisParagraph>

            <title>31(b) Disclosures</title>
            <analysisParagraph>Proposed section 205.31(b) set forth substantive disclosure requirements for remittance transfers. EFTA sections 919(a)(2)(A) and (B) require a remittance transfer provider to provide to a sender: (i) A written pre-payment disclosure with information applicable to the sender's remittance transfer—specifically, the exchange rate, the amount of transfer and other fees, and the amount that would be received by the designated recipient; and (ii) a written receipt that includes the information provided on the pre-payment disclosure, plus the promised date of delivery, contact information for the designated recipient, information regarding the sender's error resolution rights, and contact information for the remittance transfer provider and applicable regulatory agencies. EFTA section 919(a)(5)(C) also authorizes the Bureau to permit a remittance transfer provider to provide a single written disclosure to a sender, instead of a pre-payment disclosure and receipt, that accurately discloses all of the information required on both the pre-payment disclosure and the receipt. Section 1005.31(b)(1) and (2) finalize these substantive disclosure requirements for pre-payment disclosures and receipts, respectively. The final rule also permits the use of a combined disclosure, in lieu of the pre-payment disclosure and receipt, subject to the requirements in § 1005.31(b)(3).</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>As discussed below, consumer group commenters opposed the combined disclosures, but otherwise generally supported the disclosures as proposed. These commenters stated that senders currently lack the information about exchange rate, fees, and timing that is required in the disclosures. Many industry commenters generally opposed the proposed disclosures. One industry commenter stated that the Board's consumer testing demonstrated that senders were satisfied with remittance transfer providers' existing disclosures, and that the new requirements would impose significant costs without commensurate benefits to senders.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters further argued that compliance with the disclosure requirements was not possible for wire transfers and international ACH transactions. Specifically, industry commenters opposed the requirements to disclose the exchange rate, fees and taxes imposed by a person other than the provider, and the date of funds availability. One money transmitter commenter stated that these disclosure requirements could also be problematic for some money transmitters, where an international wire transfer is part of the transaction, such as when a sender conducts an account-to-account remittance transfer through a money transmitter.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>As discussed below, the Bureau understands the unique compliance challenges for institutions that send remittance transfers via wire transfer or ACH. However, as previously noted, the statute specifically applies the disclosure requirements in EFTA sections 919(a)(2)(A) and (B) to both open network and closed network transactions and provides a specific accommodation to address the compliance challenges faced for open network transactions. As such, the final rule requires all remittance transfer providers to provide either the pre-payment disclosure and a receipt, or a combined disclosure, except to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to EFTA section 919(a)(2), information on a pre-payment disclosure and a receipt need only be provided to the extent applicable to the transaction. Similarly, the information required on a combined disclosure need only be provided as applicable because the combined disclosure is simply a consolidation of the pre-payment disclosure and the receipt. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A) and (B). Proposed comment 31(b)-1 clarified that a remittance transfer provider could choose to omit an inapplicable item provided in proposed § 205.31(b). Alternatively, a remittance transfer provider could disclose a term and state that an amount or item is “not applicable,” “N/A,” or “None.” The proposed comment provided examples of when certain disclosures may not be applicable. For example, if fees or taxes are not imposed in connection with a particular transaction, the provider need not provide the disclosures about fees and taxes generally required by proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(ii) and (vi). Similarly, a Web site need not be disclosed if the provider does not maintain a Web site. The proposed comment also included an example of instances in which exchange rate information was not required on the disclosures for transactions that are both funded and received in U.S. dollars.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>One industry trade association commenter argued that dollar-to-dollar transactions should be completely excluded from the disclosure requirements. The Bureau believes, however, that fee and tax information should be disclosed to senders, even if there is no exchange rate applied to the transfer. The final rule does not exclude dollar-to-dollar transactions from the disclosure requirements, but clarifies that the exchange rate disclosure is not required for such transactions.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed, with clarifying revisions providing that an exchange rate is not required to be disclosed if an exchange rate is not applied to the transfer, even if it is not a dollar-to-dollar transaction. As such, the final comment states that a provider need not provide the exchange rate disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) if a recipient receives funds in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, or if funds are delivered into an account denominated in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded. For example, if a sender in the United States transfers funds from an account denominated in Euros to an account in France denominated in Euros, no exchange rate would need to be provided. Similarly, if a sender funds a remittance transfer in U.S. dollars and requests that a remittance transfer be delivered to the recipient in U.S. dollars, a provider need not disclose an exchange rate.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(b)-2 addressed the requirements in proposed § 205.31(b) that certain disclosures be described either using the terms set forth in § 205.31(b) or substantially similar terms. As discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the Board developed and selected the terms used in proposed § 205.31(b) through consumer testing to ensure that senders could understand the information disclosed to them. However, the May 2011 Proposed Rule provided remittance transfer providers with flexibility in developing their disclosures, both for disclosures in English and in each of the foreign languages principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers, either orally or in writing, at that office. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(g) below.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comment regarding proposed comment 31(b)-2, and it is finalized substantially as proposed. In the final rule, comment 31(b)-2 states that terms may be more specific than the terms used in the final rule. For example, a remittance transfer provider sending funds to Colombia may describe a tax disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) as a “Colombian Tax” in lieu of describing it as “Other Taxes.” Foreign language disclosures required under § 1005.31(g) must contain accurate translations of the terms, language, and notices required by § 1005.31(b).</analysisParagraph>

              <title>31(b)(1) Pre-Payment Disclosures</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A), proposed § 205.31(b)(1) stated that a remittance transfer provider must make specified pre-payment disclosures to a sender, as applicable. The disclosures are discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
            </analysisSection>
            <analysisSection>
              <title>31(b)(1)(i) Transfer Amount</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(i) provided that the remittance transfer provider must disclose the amount that will be transferred to the designated recipient using the term “Transfer Amount” or a substantially similar term. Under the proposal, the transfer amount would have to be disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be transferred because the Board believed the disclosure of the transfer amount would help demonstrate to a sender how a provider calculates the total amount of the transaction, discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters agreed that the disclosure of the transfer amount as a separate line item would help senders understand the total amount to be paid in order to send the requested amount of currency to a recipient. Industry commenters asked the Bureau to clarify how to make a disclosure in the currency in which funds will be transferred. These commenters asked if this requirement only applied where a remittance transfer provider performed the conversion. These commenters suggested that the final rule should clarify that the disclosures should be provided in the denomination of the account used to fund the transfer or in the currency submitted by the sender for the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that the transfer amount should be disclosed as proposed in order to help demonstrate the cost of the transfer to a sender. Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau deems is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to finalize this requirement in § 1005.31(b)(1)(i). For clarity, the final rule provides that the transfer amount must be disclosed in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, rather than the currency in which funds will be transferred. The Bureau believes that disclosing the transfer amount in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded—whether the sender pays with cash, with currency in an account, or by other means—will, when combined with the other required disclosures, help senders calculate the effect of the exchange rate on the transaction, if there is a currency exchange. For example, if the funds will be exchanged from U.S. dollars to Mexican pesos, the transfer amount required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(i) must be disclosed in U.S. dollars. Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(1)(i) provides that the remittance transfer provider must disclose the amount that will be transferred to the designated recipient, in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, using the term “Transfer Amount” or a substantially similar term.</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisSection>
              <title>31(b)(1)(ii) Fees and Taxes Imposed by the Provider</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(ii) required that a remittance transfer provider disclose any fees and taxes that are imposed on the remittance transfer by the remittance transfer provider, in the currency in which the funds will be transferred. The proposal stated that the disclosure must be described using the term “Transfer Fees,” “Transfer Taxes,” or “Transfer Fees and Taxes,” or a substantially similar term. These disclosures were proposed pursuant to EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(ii), which requires a remittance transfer provider to disclose the amount of transfer fees and any other fees charged by the remittance transfer provider for the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.i. clarified that taxes imposed by the remittance transfer provider include taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a State or other governmental body. The proposed comment also provided guidance applicable to the disclosure of both fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider, as well as fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, which are discussed in detail below. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), below. The proposed comment addressed the requirement that a remittance transfer provider only disclose fees or taxes as applicable. The proposed comment also stated that if both fees and taxes are imposed, the fees and taxes may be disclosed as one disclosure or as separate, itemized disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters and an industry commenter argued that the Bureau should require itemized fees and tax disclosures. They believed itemized disclosures would help senders understand what costs are fixed, such as taxes, and what costs may vary depending on the provider, such as fees. However, another industry commenter stated that disclosing fees and taxes together provided senders with adequate information on the total cost of the transaction.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees that separately listing the fees and taxes on disclosures provides better information to the sender about fixed and variable costs of the transaction, and the final rule provides that fees and taxes must be disclosed separately. Section 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) also clarifies that the fees and taxes must be disclosed in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(b)(1)(i), above. Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) states that a remittance transfer provider must disclose any fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider, in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, using the terms “Transfer Fees” for fees and “Transfer Taxes” for taxes or substantially similar terms. Comment 31(b)(1)-1.i. in the final rule is changed from the proposal to state that if both fees and taxes are imposed, the fees and taxes must be disclosed as separate, itemized disclosures. For example, a provider would disclose all transfer fees using the term “Transfer Fees” or a substantially similar term and would separately disclose all transfer taxes as “Transfer Taxes” or a substantially similar term.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter argued that because a tax is imposed by the government, and not by the remittance transfer provider, EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(ii) does not require taxes to be disclosed and, as such, the rule should not require disclosure of taxes. The Bureau believes the statute intended to require the disclosure of all charges imposed on the remittance transfer that would affect the cost of a remittance transfer to the sender. To the extent taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a State or other governmental body are charged to the sender by the remittance transfer provider, the Bureau believes they are required to be disclosed under EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(ii), which requires a remittance transfer provider to disclose transfer fees and any other fees charged by the remittance transfer provider for the remittance transfer. Even if EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(ii) did not require that such taxes be disclosed to senders, the Bureau believes that disclosing the taxes imposed on the remittance transfer will demonstrate to the sender the calculation of the total amount that the sender pays for the transfer and how this amount relates to amount that will be received by the designated recipient and is therefore necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA. As such, to the extent necessary, the Bureau is also requiring these taxes to be disclosed pursuant to its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c). Therefore, as proposed, comment 31(b)(1)-1.i. in the final rule clarifies that taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the remittance transfer provider include taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a State or other governmental body.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Finally, as proposed, comment 31(b)(1)-1.i. addresses the disclosure of fees and taxes that are applicable to the transfer. The comment in the final rule states that a provider need only disclose fees or taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider in § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) and imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), as applicable. For example, if no transfer taxes are imposed on a remittance transfer, a provider would only disclose applicable transfer fees.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii. distinguished between the fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider and the fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider. This proposed comment is addressed in the discussion regarding fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), below.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>31(b)(1)(iii) Total Amount of the Transaction</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(iii) required the disclosure of the total amount of the transaction. Although this total is not required by the statute, the Board proposed to require the disclosure of the total amount of the transaction to further the purposes of the EFTA by enabling a sender to understand the total amount to be paid out-of-pocket for the transaction. The Bureau did not receive comment on the proposed provision. Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to adopt § 205.31(b)(1)(iii) as proposed in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iii).The final rule requires a remittance transfer provider to disclose the total amount of the transaction, which is the sum of § 1005.31(b)(1)(i) and (ii), in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, using the term “Total” or a substantially similar term.</analysisParagraph>
            </analysisSection>
            <analysisSection>
              <title>31(b)(1)(iv) Exchange Rate</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(iv) required the disclosure of any exchange rate used by the provider for the remittance transfer, rounded to the nearest 1/100th of a decimal point, consistent with EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(iii). The proposed rule stated that the exchange rate must be described using the term “Exchange Rate” or a substantially similar term. The proposed rule did not permit floating rates, where the exchange rate is set when the designated recipient claims the funds.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters strongly supported the prohibition of unknown or floating exchange rates. Many industry commenters, however, urged that the final rule should accommodate floating rates and other circumstances in which an exchange rate may not be known at the time the sender requests the remittance transfer. A few industry commenters argued that the statute does not require the disclosure of an exchange rate set by institutions other than the remittance transfer provider. The commenters stated that by requiring the disclosure of the exchange rate to be used by the remittance transfer provider for the remittance transfer, EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(iii) only requires disclosure of an exchange rate that the remittance transfers provider itself set for the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>For example, industry commenters stated that most credit unions offering international transfers do not perform currency conversions themselves, but instead rely on correspondent banks or other business partners to do so. Some industry commenters also stated that most credit unions offering international transfers work with currency providers in real time to contract for exchange rates. The commenters argued that this allows the credit unions to provide their members with the most competitive exchange rates. However, in such an arrangement the exchange rate that will be applied is only known at the time the contract is accepted, and would not be known at the time disclosures are provided to the senders. Similarly, other industry commenters stated that with their current processes and systems, they would know an exchange rate once a remittance transfer is processed, but not when the remittance transfer is requested.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters also stated the exchange rate cannot be determined at the time of the request when a sender designates the receipt of a transaction in one currency, but the receiving account is denominated in another currency. In those cases, the receiving institution must convert the funds into another currency in order to complete the transfer. One industry commenter stated that its customers sometimes request remittance transfers to be sent to their foreign accounts in U.S. dollars. These senders, however, have arrangements with the recipient institutions holding their foreign accounts to convert the funds to the currencies of the accounts either at the spot rates available at the time the accounts are credited or at rates pre-arranged by contracts between the senders and the recipient institutions. One industry commenter stated that, in some countries, a recipient may choose to be paid in one of multiple currencies. The commenter also stated that it permits consumers to change the designated country for pick up. In these cases, the currency in which funds will be received may change at the option of the recipient.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>A Federal Reserve Bank commenter, as well as industry commenters, argued that requiring a fixed exchange rate for purposes of providing an exchange rate disclosure would result in less favorable exchange rates for senders. These commenters stated that if providers are required to fix the exchange rate, they will increase the spread they use in order to minimize the risks associated with rate volatility, so the cost of sending remittance transfers would increase for senders. One money transmitter commenter argued that requiring a disclosure of a fixed rate could also lead remittance transfer providers to stop providing services to some locations in which they have historically used floating rates. This commenter noted that such a requirement would require it to renegotiate its contracts with approximately 100 foreign agents representing about 10,000 locations that currently offer only floating rates. This commenter stated that this change would affect about a half million customers annually.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter believed that a remittance transfer provider should instead be permitted to disclose that the exchange rate will be changed at the rate set by a daily central bank or other official rate plus or minus a fixed offset, such as a commission. Other industry commenters suggested permitting disclosure of an estimated exchange rate, as long as the provider also discloses that the rate is subject to change. A Federal Reserve Bank commenter believed that floating exchange rate products should be exempted from the disclosure provisions in the rule.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau interprets the statute to require a remittance transfer provider to disclose to the sender the exchange rate to be used for the remittance transfer to the sender, both at the time the sender requests the remittance transfer and when the sender pays for the transfer. This interpretation is based on several factors. First, the fact that the exchange rate may be set by another institution involved in the remittance transfer does not change the fact that it will be used by the remittance transfer provider in effectuating the sender's request. Second, the statute specifically requires disclosure of the amount to be received by the designated recipient, using the values of the currency into which the funds will be exchanged. This disclosure requires a provider to determine the exchange rate to be used to effectuate the transfer, whether that rate is set by the remittance transfer provider or a third party.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The purpose of the statute supports the same conclusion. As discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the disclosure was intended to provide senders with certainty regarding the exchange rate and the amount of currency their designated recipients would receive. Senders would not be able to tell, for example, whether the funds they transmit are sufficient to pay household expenses and other bills where remittance products are based on floating rates.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau understands, however, that there may be instances in which a sender will request funds to be delivered in a particular currency, but the funds are later converted into another currency due to facts that cannot be known to the provider. In these circumstances, the Bureau believes the remittance transfer provider complies with the requirement to disclose the exchange rate when it discloses information based on the request of the sender, even if the funds are ultimately received in a different currency. If the sender does not know the currency in which the funds will be received or requests funds to be received in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, the Bureau believes that the provider may assume that the currency in which funds will be received is the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded. <em data-original="E-03">See also</em> comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-1, below.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(b)(iv) of the final rule requires disclosure of the exchange rate used by the provider for the remittance transfer, as proposed. Comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-1 clarifies that if the designated recipient will receive funds in a currency other than the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, a remittance transfer provider must disclose the exchange rate to be used by the provider for the remittance transfer. An exchange rate that is estimated must be disclosed pursuant to the requirements of § 1005.32, discussed below. A remittance transfer provider may not disclose, for example, that an exchange rate is “unknown,” “floating,” or “to be determined.”</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-1 further clarifies that if a provider does not have specific knowledge regarding the currency in which the funds will be received, the provider may rely on a sender's representation as to the currency in which funds will be received for purposes of determining whether an exchange rate is applied to the transfer. For example, if a sender requests that a remittance transfer be deposited into an account in U.S. dollars, the provider need not disclose an exchange rate, even if the account is actually denominated in Mexican pesos and the funds are converted prior to deposit into the account. If a sender does not know the currency in which funds will be received, the provider may assume that the currency in which funds will be received is the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded. The Bureau notes that if a provider does not independently have specific knowledge of the currency in which funds will be received, the provider may rely on the sender's representation as to the currency in which funds will be received. For example, the rule does not impose on providers a duty to inquire about this information with a third party.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters also argued that the exchange rate should be permitted to include more than two decimal places, consistent with their current disclosure practices. One industry commenter stated that providing exchange rates that include more than two decimal places provides senders with more accurate and detailed exchange rate information.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees that it may be appropriate for some providers to disclose an exchange rate that includes more than two decimal places, because a provider may determine that the disclosure would provide a sender with a more accurate representation of the remittance transfer's cost, based on the particular type of transaction or type of currency being used. However, the Bureau also believes that some providers may determine that rounding to fewer digits may sufficiently inform senders of the cost of the exchange. The Bureau is also mindful that a disclosure that includes a long string of numbers could confuse some senders. The Bureau believes it is appropriate to permit a remittance transfer provider to disclose an exchange rate rounded to a number of decimal places that best reflects the cost to the sender, within a range that will not potentially confuse the sender.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) authority in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) to permit the exchange rate to be rounded consistently for each currency to no fewer than two decimal places and no more than four decimal places. The exchange rate must be disclosed using the term “Exchange Rate” or a substantially similar term. Comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-2 of the final rule is revised to reflect the more flexible rounding requirements. Comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-2 clarifies that the exchange rate disclosed by the provider for the remittance transfer is required to be rounded. The provider may round to two, three, or four decimal places, at its option. For example, if one U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9483779 Mexican pesos, a provider may disclose that the U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9484 Mexican pesos. The provider may alternatively disclose, for example, that the U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.948 pesos or 11.95 pesos. On the other hand, if one U.S. dollar exchanges for exactly 11.9 Mexican pesos, the provider may disclose that “US$1=11.9 MXN” in lieu of, for example, “US$1=11.90 MXN.”</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Though the Bureau is permitting flexibility for rounding exchange rate disclosures, the Bureau believes that each provider should disclose its exchange rates in a consistent manner. The Bureau believes that if a provider were permitted to round exchange rates for a particular currency on a transaction-by-transaction basis, a provider could round exchange rates differently in order to make the exchange rate appear to be more favorable. For example, the Bureau does not believe a provider that typically rounds to four decimal places for a specific currency (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> the U.S. dollar exchanges for 0.7551 Euros) should be permitted to round to two decimal places for some of those currency transactions (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> the U.S. dollar exchanges for 0.76 Euros). Comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-2 thus clarifies that the exchange rate disclosed for the remittance transfer must be rounded consistently for each currency. For example, a provider may not round to two decimal places for some transactions exchanged into Euros and round to four decimal places for other transactions exchanged into Euros.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, a provider may use an exchange rate that is not necessarily set by the provider itself. The final rule adds a new comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-3 to clarify that the exchange rate used by the provider and applied to the remittance transfer need not be set by that provider. For example, an exchange rate set by an intermediary institution and applied to the remittance transfer would be the exchange rate used for the remittance transfer and must be disclosed by the provider.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters and an industry trade association asked the Bureau to clarify how the exchange rate requirements would apply when a remittance transfer involves a prepaid card. These commenters asked how disclosures, such as the exchange rate, could be provided in accordance with the timing provisions in the May 2011 Proposed Rule when a provider would not know when the recipient would withdraw funds abroad or how much the recipient would withdraw. To the extent a prepaid card is covered by the rule, <em data-original="E-03">see</em> § 1005.30(e), the funds that will be received by the designated recipient are those that are loaded on to the prepaid card by the sender at the time of the transaction. Often a prepaid card is both funded and loaded in U.S. dollars, and funds remain on the card in U.S. dollars until a cardholder withdraws funds in a foreign country. In these instances, a provider need not provide the exchange rate disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), because a recipient will receive the currency in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 31(b)-1.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Finally, a Federal Reserve Bank commenter noted that the exchange rate cannot be determined when a sender initiates payment on a recurring basis. The Bureau recognizes the unique challenges relating to recurring payments, and the final rule provides alternative provisions for these circumstances in § 1005.36, discussed below.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>31(b)(1)(v) Transfer Amount</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(v) generally required providers to repeat the disclosure of the transfer amount in proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(i). Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(v), however, required the transfer amount to be disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be received by the designated recipient to demonstrate to the sender how third party fees or taxes imposed under proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(vi), which are also required to be disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be received, would reduce the amount received by the designated recipient. Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(v), however, only required this repeat disclosure if third party fees or taxes are imposed under proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(vi), because it would not otherwise be necessary to demonstrate a reduction of the transfer amount by third party fees and taxes. The proposed disclosure was required to be described using the term “Transfer Amount” or a substantially similar term. Both the transfer amount required to be disclosed by proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(i) and the transfer amount required to be disclosed by proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(v) were proposed to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comment on the requirement to disclose the transfer amount in proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(v). Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to finalize this requirement as proposed in § 1005.31(b)(1)(v). The Bureau received comments regarding concerns about making disclosures in the currency in which the funds will be received by the designated recipient. These comments, and a clarification regarding the currency in which the funds will be received by the designated recipient, are discussed below. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-1.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(b)(1)-2 provided more guidance on the requirement to repeat the transfer amount disclosure in some circumstances, and it is adopted substantially as proposed. The comment reflects the clarification in the final rule that disclosure under § 1005.31(b)(1)(i) must be disclosed in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded. Comment 31(b)(1)-2 clarifies that two transfer amounts are required to be disclosed by § 1005.31(b)(1)(i) and (v). First, a provider must disclose the transfer amount in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded to show the calculation of the total amount of the transaction. Typically, the remittance transfer is funded in U.S. dollars, so the transfer amount would be expressed in U.S. dollars. However, if remittance transfer is funded, for example, from a Euro-denominated account, the transfer amount would be expressed in Euros.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Second, a provider must disclose the transfer amount in the currency in which the funds will be made available to the designated recipient. For example, if the funds will be picked up by the designated recipient in Japanese yen, the transfer amount would be expressed in Japanese yen. However, the comment also clarifies that this second transfer amount need not be disclosed if fees and taxes are not imposed for the remittance transfer under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). As discussed above, in such cases, there is no consumer benefit to the additional information if the transferred amount is not reduced by other fees and taxes.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(b)(1)(v) also requires a remittance transfer provider to use the term “Transfer Amount” or a substantially similar term to describe the disclosure required under this paragraph. Comment 31(b)(1)-2 clarifies, as proposed, that the terms used to describe each transfer amount should be the same.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau believes that the rounded exchange rate required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) is intended only to ensure that senders are not overwhelmed by a disclosure of an exchange rate with many numbers following the decimal point. The Bureau does not believe it is intended to constrain the number of decimal places involved in calculating other disclosures. Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(1)(v) adds the clarification that the exchange rate used to calculate the transfer amount in § 1005.31(b)(1)(v) is the exchange rate in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by § 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate. Comment 31(b)(1)-3 provides examples to demonstrate the exchange rate that must be used to calculate not only the transfer amount in § 1005.31(b)(1)(v), but also the fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) and the amount received in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii). For example, if one U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9483779 Mexican pesos, a provider must calculate these disclosures using this rate, even though the provider may disclose pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) that the U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9484 Mexican pesos. Similarly, if a provider estimates pursuant to § 1005.32 that one U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9483 Mexican pesos, a provider must calculate these disclosures using this rate, even though the provider may disclose pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) that the U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.95 Mexican pesos (Estimated). If an exchange rate need not be rounded, a provider must use that exchange rate to calculate these disclosures. For example, if one U.S. dollar exchanges for exactly 11.9 Mexican pesos, a provider must calculate these disclosures using this exchange rate.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>31(b)(1)(vi) Fees and Taxes Imposed by a Person Other Than the Provider</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(vi) stated that a remittance transfer provider must disclose any fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, in the currency in which the funds will be received by the designated recipient. Such fees and taxes could include lifting fees charged in connection with an international wire transfer, a fee charged by a recipient institution or agent, or a tax imposed by a government in the designated recipient's country. Because such fees and taxes affect the amount ultimately received by the designated recipient, the Board proposed the disclosure of other fees and taxes to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters supported the disclosure of third party fees and taxes to senders of remittance transfers, stating that such a disclosure would be consistent with the language and purpose of the statute, and would best inform the sender of the amount the recipient would ultimately receive. In contrast, industry commenters opposed the disclosure. Most industry commenters argued that compliance with the proposed disclosure requirement would be burdensome, if not impossible. Commenters stated that financial institutions sending wire transfers and international ACH transactions only have control over the delivery to the next institution, and in some cases do not have a relationship with all of the subsequent intermediary institutions involved in a transfer or with the recipient institution. The originating institution may, in some cases, know the routing, but in other cases have no legal or technological means to control routing of a transaction once the transfer has been initiated and, therefore, it cannot know what institutions might be imposing fees or taxes on the remittance transfer. One industry commenter suggested that providing the disclosures may be possible for repeat wire transfers, because fee and tax information is known from the previous transfers, but not for new wire transfers.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters and a Federal Reserve Bank commenter argued that third party fees and taxes may not be known at the time of the transaction, which could result in the remittance transfer provider providing misleading information to the sender. Industry commenters also argued that smaller institutions do not have the resources to obtain or monitor information about foreign tax laws or fees charged by unrelated financial institutions that may be involved in the transfer. Some commenters noted that intermediary financial institutions, both inside and outside of the United States, are not required to disclose their fees. Moreover, some industry commenters argued, the sharing of fee information among financial institutions could violate privacy and competition laws. Industry commenters stated that no comprehensive information is available regarding foreign tax laws. Because an institution may not have resources to track tax laws in every foreign country to which it sends a remittance transfer, the commenters argued that some providers would limit the locations to which they send remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Further, some industry commenters noted that a recipient may enter into an agreement with a recipient institution that permits the institution to impose fees for an international payment received by the institution and applied to the recipient's account. The commenters stated that remittance transfer providers would not know whether the recipient has agreed to pay such fees or how much the recipient may have agreed to pay. The commenters argued that such fees charged to a recipient by a third party pursuant to an agreement between the recipient and a third party should not be required to be disclosed.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters argued that the statute did not intend for third party fees and taxes to be included in the disclosure of the total amount that will be received by the designated recipient. For example, one industry commenter argued that the statute only intended to include in the calculation of the amount of currency to be received the elements specifically required to be disclosed under EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii) (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the amount of transfer fees and any other fees charged by the remittance transfer provider, and any exchange rate to be used by the remittance transfer provider for the remittance transfer). Another industry commenter argued that State laws that require a remittance transfer provider to disclose to a sender the total amount to be received by the designated recipient do not require disclosure of third party fees and taxes that may be imposed on the remittance transfer. Instead, the commenters argued, State laws only require the remittance transfer provider to disclose the amount of currency to be received after application of the exchange rate. Therefore, the commenters stated that fees or taxes set by a party other than the remittance transfer provider are not required to be included in the disclosure of the total amount received and, therefore, should not be required to be disclosed separately.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Overall, many industry commenters stated that the proposed disclosure requirements would cause financial institutions to withdraw from the market or restrict the locations to which wire transfers will be sent. The commenters also stated that the proposed requirements would increase costs to senders, and some argued that the proposed requirements would delay transactions while financial institutions determined the required information in order to make disclosures. Some industry commenters argued that the requirements put financial institutions at a competitive disadvantage compared to money transmitters, which, they argued, are typically able to know the required disclosures due to their closed network structure. Further, they argued that the proposed requirements could deter foreign financial institutions from agreeing to process U.S.-originated remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Generally, industry commenters urged the Bureau to exempt financial institutions that provide remittance transfers through correspondent relationships from the requirement to disclose third party fees or require different disclosures for these types of transactions. Industry commenters and a Federal Reserve Bank commenter also suggested that the final rule should incorporate a good faith standard with respect to these fee and tax disclosures. Some industry commenters further argued that the Bureau should not require foreign taxes to be provided, regardless of whether a remittance transfer was sent through a correspondent relationship. Industry commenters alternatively suggested that the Bureau only require a disclosure that the amount received may be subject to foreign taxes. A Federal Reserve Bank commenter suggested that the Bureau should provide a safe harbor for the foreign tax disclosure for providers that disclosed current or historical information available to the provider through reasonable efforts.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Commenters also suggested that the Bureau assist industry with determining unknown fees and taxes, particularly to help ease the disclosure burden on small providers. One industry commenter believed the Bureau should require correspondent institutions to publish the fees and taxes that are charged. Industry and consumer group commenters suggested that the Bureau should maintain a resource that provides relevant foreign taxes.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the introduction above, the Bureau recognizes the challenges for remittance transfer providers to determining fees and taxes imposed by third parties. However, the plain language of the statute requires disclosure of the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient. The Bureau believes this requires remittance transfer providers to determine the costs specifically related to the remittance transfer that may reduce the amount received by the designated recipient. Congress specifically recognized that these determinations would be difficult with regard to open network transactions by financial institutions and tailored a specific accommodation to allow use of reasonably accurate estimates for an interim period until financial institutions can develop methods to determine exact disclosures, such as fees and taxes charged by third parties.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>This disclosure provides consumer benefits by making senders aware of the impact of these fees and taxes, which is essential to fulfill the purpose of the statute. Providing a total to recipient that reflects the impact of third party fees and taxes, and separately disclosing those fees and taxes, will provide senders with a greater transparency regarding the cost of a remittance transfer. For many senders and recipients, disclosure of the amount of third party fees and taxes that may be deducted could be crucial to knowing whether the amount transferred will be sufficient to pay important household expenses and other bills. Senders also need to know the amount of such fees and taxes to determine whether to use the same provider for any future transfers. Without such information, it would be difficult for a sender to determine the costs of the transfer that would enable the sender to choose the most cost-effective method of sending remittance transfers. Moreover, as discussed below, the cost of third party taxes may vary depending on the types of institutions involved in the transmittal route, and disclosure of these taxes will assist senders comparing costs between providers. While the Bureau understands that tax information may not be readily available to a provider, the provider is in the best position to obtain the information to comply with the disclosure requirements. Because a provider will be engaged in sending remittance transfers to certain countries and, in some cases, will have relationships with entities in those countries, the Bureau believes the provider itself is in the best position to determine foreign tax information.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to require in § 1005.31(b)(vi) of the final rule the disclosure of any fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, using the terms “Other Fees” for fees and “Other Taxes” for taxes, or substantially similar terms.<footnote ref="76">Due to a scrivener's error, § 205.31(b)(vi) in the proposed rule had stated that these fees and taxes must be disclosed using the term “Other &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Transfer&lt;/em&gt; Fees,” “Other &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Transfer&lt;/em&gt; Taxes,” or “Other &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Transfer&lt;/em&gt; Fees and Taxes,” or a substantially similar term (emphasis added). The model forms as proposed, however, used the term “Other Fees and Taxes.” The terms set forth in § 1005.31(b)(vi) are adopted without the word “transfer” in order to more concisely describe the fees and taxes required to be disclosed in § 1005.31(b)(vi). The terms used in the final rule conform to the language used in the model forms, which participants in consumer testing generally understood to mean fees and taxes charged by a person other than the provider.</footnote>
                As discussed above, fees and taxes must be disclosed separately from one another in order to show which costs are fixed and which costs are variable. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 31(b)(1)-1.i. As discussed above, the Bureau believes that the rounded exchange rate required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) is not intended to constrain the number of decimal places involved in calculating other disclosures. Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) adds the clarification that the exchange rate used to calculate the fees and taxes in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) is the exchange rate in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by § 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate. As discussed above, comment 31(b)(1)-3 provides examples to demonstrate the exchange rate that must be used to calculate the fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As noted above, proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii. distinguished between the fees and taxes imposed by the provider, discussed above in § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii), and the fees and taxes imposed by a person other than the provider. The proposed comment provided examples of each of these types of fees and taxes. Proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii. also clarified that the terms used to describe each of these types of fees and taxes must differentiate between such fees and taxes and provided an example to illustrate this differentiation.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters requested clarification regarding the types of fees imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider. For example, an industry commenter and a Federal Reserve Bank commenter asked the Bureau to clarify that these fees and taxes do not include fees and taxes that banks and other parties charge one another for handling a remittance transfer, so long as the fees do not affect the amount of the transfer. Another industry commenter asked whether funds deducted from the amount received in a remittance transfer by a recipient institution exercising its rights of set-off would be required to be disclosed as a fee to a sender.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii. of the final rule clarifies that the fees and taxes required to be disclosed include only those that are charged to the sender or designated recipient and are specifically related to the remittance transfer. The Bureau does not believe that any fee or tax is required to be disclosed solely because it is charged at the same time that a remittance transfer is sent, because such fees and taxes are not necessarily “imposed on the remittance transfer.” For example, an overdraft fee charged by a bank at the same time that a remittance transfer is sent or received in an account is not imposed on the remittance transfer. In order to further clarify what charges should be disclosed to senders, the comment in the final rule provides examples of the types of fees that are not required to be disclosed under this provision, in addition to the examples of the types of fees that should be included that were included in the May 2011 Proposed Rule.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Specifically, comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii. states that the fees and taxes required to be disclosed by § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) include all fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider. For example, a provider must disclose a service fee and any State taxes imposed on the remittance transfer. In contrast, the fees and taxes required to be disclosed by § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) include fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider. Fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider include only those fees and taxes that are charged to the sender or designated recipient and are specifically related to the remittance transfer. For example, a provider must disclose fees imposed on a remittance transfer by the receiving institution or agent at pick-up for receiving the transfer, fees imposed on a remittance transfer by intermediary institutions in connection with an international wire transfer, and taxes imposed on a remittance transfer by a foreign government.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>However, the comment states that a provider need not disclose, for example, overdraft fees that are imposed by a recipient's bank or funds that are garnished from the proceeds of a remittance transfer to satisfy an unrelated debt, because these charges are not specifically related to the remittance transfer. Similarly, fees that banks charge one another for handling a remittance transfer or other fees that do not affect the total amount of the transaction or the amount that will be received by the designated recipient are not charged to the sender or designated recipient. For example, an interchange fee that is charged to a provider when a sender uses a credit or debit card to pay for a remittance transfer need not be disclosed. The comment also clarifies that the terms used to describe the fees or taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider in § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) and imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) must differentiate between such fees and taxes. For example, the terms used to describe fees disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) and (vi) may not both be described solely as “Fees.”</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-1 clarified how a provider must disclose fees and taxes in the currency in which funds will be received. Industry commenters expressed concern that a remittance transfer provider may not know the currency in which the funds will be received. As discussed above in comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-1, if a provider does not have specific knowledge regarding the currency in which the funds will be received, the provider may rely on a sender's representations as to the currency in which funds will be received.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed, with an added clarification regarding reliance on a sender's representation regarding the currency in which the funds will be received. The Bureau is also revising the comment to reflect the clarification that disclosures that require an exchange rate to be applied should use the exchange rate in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by § 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-1 states that § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) requires the disclosure of fees and taxes in the currency in which the funds will be received by the designated recipient. A fee or tax described in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) may be imposed in one currency, but the funds may be received by the designated recipient in another currency. In such cases, the remittance transfer provider must calculate the fee or tax to be disclosed using the exchange rate in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by § 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate. For example, an intermediary institution in an international wire transfer may impose a fee in U.S. dollars, but funds are ultimately deposited in the recipient's account in Euros. In this case, the provider would disclose the fee to the sender expressed in Euros, calculated using the exchange rate used by the provider for the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The comment further states that for purposes of § 1005.31(b)(1)(v), (vi), and (vii), if a provider does not have specific knowledge regarding the currency in which the funds will be received, the provider may rely on a sender's representation as to the currency in which funds will be received. For example, if a sender requests that a remittance transfer be deposited into an account in U.S. dollars, the provider may provide the disclosures required in § 1005.31(b)(1)(v), (vi), and (vii) in U.S. dollars, even if the account is denominated in Mexican pesos and the funds are subsequently converted prior to deposit into the account. If a sender does not know the currency in which funds will be received, the provider may assume that the currency in which funds will be received is the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The final rule also adds a new comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-2 to address situations where the information needed to determine the foreign taxes that apply to a transaction is not known to the provider and not publically available. Some industry commenters stated that foreign taxes may depend on variables other than the country to which the remittance transfer is sent, such as by the specific tax status of the sender and receiver, account type, or type of financial institution. The commenters stated that a sender may not be aware of the information needed to determine the tax obligation that applies to the transaction.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that when these types of variables affect the foreign taxes that apply to the transaction, providers may have to rely on representations made by the sender. If the sender does not know the information, and the provider does not otherwise have specific knowledge of the information, the Bureau believes it is necessary to provide a reasonable mechanism by which the provider may disclose the foreign tax. The Bureau believes it is appropriate in these instances to disclose the highest tax that could be imposed with respect to a particular variable, so the sender is not surprised that the amount received is reduced by more taxes than what is disclosed.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-2 states that the amount of taxes imposed by a person other than the provider may depend on the tax status of the sender or recipient, the type of accounts or financial institutions involved in the transfer, or other variables. For example, the amount of tax may depend on whether the receiver is a resident of the country in which the funds are received or the type of account to which the funds are delivered. If a provider does not have specific knowledge regarding variables that affect the amount of taxes imposed by a person other than the provider for purposes of determining these taxes, the provider may rely on a sender's representations regarding these variables, pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). If a sender does not know the information relating to the variables that affect the amount of taxes imposed by a person other than the provider, the provider may disclose the highest possible tax that could be imposed for the remittance transfer with respect to any unknown variable.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that if a provider does not independently have specific knowledge regarding variables that affect the amount of taxes imposed by a person other than the provider, the provider may rely on the sender's representations regarding these variables. For example, the rule does not impose on providers a duty to inquire about this information with a third party. The Bureau also notes that a provider may continue to rely on the sender's representations in any subsequent remittance transfers, unless the provider has specific knowledge that information relating to such variables has changed.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>31(b)(1)(vii) Amount Received</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(vii) stated that a remittance transfer provider must disclose to the sender the amount that will be received by the designated recipient, in the currency in which the funds will be received. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(i). The proposed rule stated that the disclosures should be described using the term “Total to Recipient” or a substantially similar term. The proposed rule provided that the disclosure must reflect all charges that would affect the amount to be received.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>For the reasons discussed above, industry commenters objected to the proposal because, they argued, costs that are required to be known to disclose the amount received, such as the exchange rate and third party fees and taxes, cannot be known at the time the pre-payment disclosure and receipt are required to be disclosed. As discussed above, an industry commenter argued that the statute only intended the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient to reflect the other elements that are required to be disclosed separately under EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii). Other industry commenters argued that the disclosure should only reflect the exchange rate, fees, and taxes set by the remittance transfer provider itself, and not those set or charged by persons other than the provider. Some industry commenters believed the amount that will be received by the designated recipient should be subject to a good faith standard, should be permitted to be estimated, or should include a statement that the total amount is subject to change.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(i) requires a remittance transfer provider to disclose the amount received by the designated recipient using the values of the currency into which the funds will be exchanged. The Bureau interprets the amount to be received by the designated recipient as the amount net of all fees and taxes that will be paid for the transfer. An exchange rate, if one is applied, is just one of the factors that could affect the actual amount received by the designated recipient. Providing a total amount to be received that does not take into account all cost elements would not be consistent with the statute's goal of providing disclosures of the total costs of a remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is not persuaded that the amount to be received by the designated recipient should only reflect those elements that are separately required to be disclosed under the statute. Under the plain language of EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(i), the amount of funds that will be received by the designated recipient must be disclosed to the sender. The Bureau believes this amount must reflect all fees and taxes specifically related to the remittance transfer, regardless of the entity that charges them. Moreover, the Bureau believes that the exchange rate to be used to calculate the total to recipient is the exchange rate that is used for the remittance transfer, whether or not the remittance transfer provider itself sets the exchange rate or merely applies an exchange rate set by another entity to the transaction. Absent this approach, providers could disclose different amounts received depending only on whether the provider itself or a different institution applies the exchange rate. The Bureau believes such a result would be inconsistent with the statutory goal of providing the sender with the actual amount that will be received by the designated recipient.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Therefore, proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(vii) is adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii), with an addition to clarify the appropriate exchange rate that must be used to calculate the amount received, discussed below. Comment 31(b)(1)(vii)-1 is also adopted substantially as proposed to clarify the charges that must be reflected in the amount received. The comment is amended to clarify that the disclosed amount received must be reduced by the amount of any fee or tax, whether the fee or tax is imposed on the remittance transfer by the remittance transfer provider or by a person other than the remittance transfer provider. The comment clarifies that the fees and taxes that must be disclosed are those fees and taxes that are imposed on the remittance transfer. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 31(b)(1)-1-ii. Specifically, comment 31(b)(1)(vii)-1 states that the disclosed amount to be received by the designated recipient must reflect all charges imposed on the remittance transfer that affect the amount received, including the exchange rate and all fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the remittance transfer provider, the receiving institution, or any other party in the transmittal route of a remittance transfer. The disclosed amount received must be reduced by the amount of any fee or tax that is imposed on the remittance transfer by any person, even if that amount is imposed or itemized separately from the transaction amount.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Finally, § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) revises proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(vii) to clarify the exchange rate that should be used in calculating the amount received. One industry commenter stated that using a rounded exchange rate may add some <em data-original="E-03">de minimis</em> value to the amount received. For some currencies, this may result in a transaction amount being disclosed in a foreign currency for which no coins are available to complete the transaction. The commenter recommended a <em data-original="E-03">de minimis</em> exemption for error resolution triggered based on rounding. As discussed above, the Bureau believes that the rounded exchange rate required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) is not intended to constrain the number of decimal places involved in calculating other disclosures. Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) adds the clarification that the exchange rate used to calculate the amount received in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) is the exchange rate in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by § 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate. As discussed above, comment 31(b)(1)-3 provides examples to demonstrate the exchange rate that must be used to calculate the amount received.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>31(b)(2) Receipt</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(2) provided that a remittance transfer provider must disclose a written receipt to a sender when payment is made for the remittance transfer. As with the proposed pre-payment disclosure, the disclosures required on the receipt could be omitted if not applicable. The required disclosures are discussed below.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>31(b)(2)(i) Pre-Payment Disclosures on Receipt</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(i) provided that the same disclosures included in the pre-payment disclosure must be disclosed on the receipt, pursuant to EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(i)(I). As discussed above, the Bureau is requiring providers to disclose some information in the pre-payment disclosure, such as the transfer amount, that is not specifically required by EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A). The Bureau did not receive comment regarding the requirement to provide the same pre-payment disclosures on the receipt. Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to finalize that requirement in renumbered § 1005.31(b)(2)(i), as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
            </analysisSection>
            <analysisSection>
              <title>31(b)(2)(ii) Date Available</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(2) also provided for the disclosure of additional elements on the receipt. EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(i)(II) requires the disclosure of the promised date of delivery to the designated recipient on a receipt. The Board stated its belief that the statute requires disclosure of the date the currency will be available to the designated recipient, not the date the funds are physically picked up by the designated recipient, because the recipient may not pick up the funds for some period of time after the funds are available. Thus, proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(ii) stated that a remittance transfer provider must disclose the date of availability of funds to the designated recipient, using the term “Date Available” or a substantially similar term. Proposed comment 31(b)(2)-1 provided further guidance on this disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In the proposal, the Board recognized that in some instances, it may be difficult to determine the exact date on which a remittance transfer will be available to a designated recipient. For example, an international wire transfer may pass through several intermediary institutions prior to becoming available at the institution of a designated recipient, and the time it takes to pass through these intermediaries may be difficult to determine. As a result, the Board recognized that remittance transfer providers would likely disclose the latest date on which the funds would be available, even if funds are often available sooner. Thus, proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(ii) permitted a provider to include a statement that funds may be available to the designated recipient earlier than the date disclosed, using the term “may be available sooner” or a substantially similar term. The Board had tested various terms in consumer testing for communicating the fact that funds may be available earlier than the date disclosed. Participants generally understood the meaning of the statement that funds “may be available sooner” better than other terms.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters supported the disclosure of the date funds will be available. Many industry commenters argued, however, that it would be difficult or impossible to determine when funds would be made available to a recipient in an open network system, such as where transfers are made to an account at a financial institution with which the provider does not have a correspondent relationship. Industry commenters argued that even if the date of receipt by a recipient financial institution is known, there could be a delay in depositing the funds into a recipient account due to delays at intermediary financial institutions or at the recipient institution. One industry trade association stated that infrastructure deficiencies in some countries may make it impossible to determine the actual date on which funds will be available.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>An industry commenter supported the flexibility provided by the term “may be available sooner,” but stated that dates still may be unpredictable for reasons beyond a provider's control. One industry trade association argued that in order to mitigate compliance risks, some remittance transfer providers will disclose a date well past a reasonable estimate of the date funds will be made available, which would render the disclosure meaningless.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Due to these factors, some industry commenters urged the Bureau to permit an estimated date of availability, including an estimate of the date that funds may be available to a recipient institution, and not the recipient. One commenter suggested that the disclosure could state that a transfer may be delayed by intermediaries or other factors beyond the provider's control.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As stated in the proposal, EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(i)(II) requires disclosure of a single, promised date of delivery of the funds. Neither EFTA section 919(a)(4) nor EFTA section 919(c) permit a remittance transfer provider to provide an estimate of this promised date, despite the fact that the statute permits estimates in other circumstances. Moreover, because the statute requires a remittance transfer provider to provide a disclosure of the promised date of delivery to the designated recipient, the Bureau believes that permitting a provider to disclose the date that funds will be made available to the recipient institution would not comply with the statute.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that by permitting the provider to disclose a date by which funds will certainly be delivered, but also stating that funds “may be available sooner,” a provider can comply with the disclosure requirement. The Bureau recognizes that providers may overestimate the disclosed date on which funds will be available to mitigate compliance risks. However, the Bureau believes that competitive pressures will give providers an incentive to provide as accurate a date as possible.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) is finalized substantially as proposed. Section 1005.31(b)(2)(ii), however, clarifies in the rule, rather than the commentary, as proposed, that a provider must disclose the date in the foreign country on which funds will be available to the designated recipient. This clarification is included to account for instances where time zone differences result in a date in the United States being different from the date in the country of the designated recipient.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The final rule also adopts comment 31(b)(2)-1 substantially as proposed. The comment clarifies that a remittance transfer provider may not provide a range of dates that the remittance transfer may be available, nor an estimate of the date on which funds will be available. If a provider does not know the exact date on which funds will be available, the provider may disclose the latest date on which the funds will be available. For example, if funds may be available on January 3, but are not certain to be available until January 10, then a provider complies with § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) if it discloses January 10 as the date funds will be available. However, a remittance transfer provider may also disclose that funds “may be available sooner” or use a substantially similar term to inform senders that funds may be available to the designated recipient on a date earlier that the date disclosed. For example, the provider may disclose “January 10 (may be available sooner).”</analysisParagraph>

The proposed rule stated that the remittance transfer provider must describe the disclosure using the term “Recipient” or a substantially similar term. The Bureau did not receive comment on proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(iii), which is adopted as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(b)(2)(iii).</analysisParagraph>

              <title>31(b)(2)(iv) Rights of Sender</title>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail below regarding §§ 1005.33 and 1005.34, EFTA section 919(d) provides the sender with substantive error resolution and cancellation rights. EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(ii)(I) requires a remittance transfer provider to provide a statement containing information about the rights of the sender regarding the resolution of errors on the receipt or combined disclosure. EFTA section 919(d)(3) requires the Bureau to issue final rules regarding appropriate cancellation and refund policies for senders. The Board stated its belief that providing a lengthy disclosure to the sender each time the sender makes a remittance transfer could be ineffective at conveying the most important information that a sender would need to resolve an error or cancel a transaction. However, the Board also stated that a sender should have access to a complete description of the sender's error resolution and cancellation rights in order to effectively exercise those rights. As a result, the Board proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(iv) in conjunction with a long form error resolution notice in proposed § 205.31(b)(4). The two disclosures were intended to balance the interest in providing a sender a concise disclosure with the sender's ability to obtain a full explanation of those rights.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(iv) stated that a remittance transfer provider must disclose to a sender an abbreviated statement about the sender's error resolution and cancellation rights using language set forth in Model Form A-37 of Appendix A or substantially similar language. The proposed statement included a brief disclosure of the sender's error resolution and cancellation rights, as well as a notification that a sender may contact the remittance transfer provider for a written explanation of these rights.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters argued that the abbreviated disclosure in proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(iv) should provide more comprehensive information to a sender. These commenters also suggested that the abbreviated disclosure would not comply with the statute. One of the consumer group commenters stated that all of the senders' rights should be disclosed on the receipt, instead of a shorter disclosure, because senders of remittance transfers may be less educated or less likely to have access to phone and internet compared to other consumers.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees that education of senders about the consumer protections created by EFTA section 919 is an important statutory and policy goal. However, the Bureau believes EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(ii)(I) does not require a remittance transfer provider to enumerate a sender's error resolution rights. Rather, the statute requires the provider to disclose information about the rights of the sender under EFTA section 919 regarding the resolution of errors, and the Bureau believes the proposed language satisfies this requirement. Moreover, consumer testing participants understood and responded positively to the concise, abbreviated disclosure and favorably compared the statement against current error resolution disclosures with which they had experience and which they noted could be long and in “fine print.” Thus, the Bureau is finalizing the abbreviated disclosure requirement in renumbered § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv). <em data-original="E-03">See also</em> § 1005.31(b)(4), below. The Bureau, however, is amending the language in the abbreviated statement about senders' error resolution rights on Model Form A-37 to include a more explicit statement informing senders that they have such rights. The Bureau is also adding a requirement in § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) to account for the alternative cancellation requirements in § 1005.36(c) for remittance transfers scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, as discussed below. Section 1005.31(b)(2)(iv), therefore, also provides that for any remittance transfer scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, the statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation must instead reflect the requirements of § 1005.36(c).</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(ii)(II) generally requires that the remittance transfer provider disclose appropriate contact information for the remittance transfer provider, its State regulator, and the Bureau. The Board stated that appropriate contact information includes the name, telephone number, and Web site of these entities, so that senders would have multiple options for addressing any issues that may arise with respect to a remittance transfer provider. Proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(v) provided for the disclosure of the name, telephone number, and Web site of the remittance transfer provider. The Bureau did not receive comment on proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(v), and the Bureau is finalizing it substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(b)(2)(v). The final rule adds language to allow providers to disclose more than one telephone number to account for circumstances, for example, where a provider maintains a separate TTY/TDD telephone number.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>31(b)(2)(vi) Agency Contact Information</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(vi) provided for disclosure of a statement that the sender can contact the State agency that regulates the remittance transfer provider and the Bureau for questions or complaints about the remittance transfer provider, using language set forth in Model Form A-37 of Appendix A or substantially similar language. The proposed statement included contact information for these agencies, including the toll-free telephone number of the Bureau established under section 1013 of the Dodd-Frank Act.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Board requested comment on several aspects of proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(vi). First, the Board solicited comment on whether and how a remittance transfer provider should be required to disclose information regarding a State agency that regulates the provider for remittance transfers conducted through a toll-free telephone number or online and, if so, what would be the appropriate State agency to disclose to a sender. Some commenters believed the disclosure of Bureau contact information would be sufficient. Several industry commenters argued that the Bureau should not require a remittance transfer provider to disclose the State agency that regulates the remittance transfer. These commenters believed the requirement would create operational hurdles for providers that operate in multiple states and would provide negligible consumer protection benefit.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>One money transmitter commenter stated that it would be difficult to tailor State regulator disclosures to each individual agent, and that managing State-specific receipts and forms would be costly. This commenter stated that agents that provide services in multiple states often distribute forms to their locations as part of their chain of distribution. Requiring these agents to manage State-specific forms, the commenter argued, would be a significant change in distribution processes and could create liability risk for the remittance transfer provider. This commenter believed remittance transfer providers would thus create a multi-State disclosure form, which would provide senders with superfluous information.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Another money transmitter commenter noted that many states already have guidance regarding the prominence and placement of contact information on a remittance transfer provider's Web site and in storefront locations. The commenter stated that many states prefer senders to contact the remittance transfer provider before contacting a State agency for questions and complaints. The commenter believed that the Bureau should instead require a statement that would refer to other sources, such as a Web site or toll-free number, to obtain contact information for the appropriate State agency, and that the Bureau should maintain contact information for State agencies, so that senders could contact the Bureau for appropriate State agency information.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(ii)(II) requires a remittance transfer provider to provide appropriate contact information for the State agency that regulates the remittance transfer provider. The Bureau does not believe that providing contact information for an alternative source that maintains a list of State agencies would satisfy the statutory requirement. The Bureau recognizes that remittance transfer providers that have locations in multiple states, or that provide remittance transfers online or by telephone, will have to determine the appropriate State agency to disclose on a receipt. The Bureau believes that due to segregation and other formatting requirements, discussed below, a remittance transfer provider may not disclose contact information for agencies in other states. Therefore, the final rule maintains the requirement to disclose information regarding a State agency that regulates the remittance transfer provider.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>However, several changes are made in the final rule to clarify which State agency should be disclosed, because a remittance transfer provider may be regulated by more than one agency in a particular State. The Bureau believes that the statute is meant to provide senders a resource for addressing problems regarding a particular remittance transfer and that the State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider is the appropriate State agency to provide such assistance to senders. Thus, in § 1005.31(b)(2)(vi), the final rule adds the clarification that the disclosure must disclose the State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider with respect to the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Second, the Board requested comment on whether a remittance transfer provider should be required to disclose the contact information for the Bureau, including the toll-free telephone number, in cases where the Bureau is not the primary Federal regulator for consumer complaints against the remittance transfer provider. The Board also requested comment on whether it would be appropriate to instead require the contact information of the primary Federal regulator of the remittance transfer provider for consumer complaints.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters and an industry commenter stated that the Bureau's contact information should be included on the receipt. These commenters stated that listing the Bureau's contact information, rather than the primary Federal regulator, would ensure that consumer complaints about remittance transfer provider were centralized in one Federal agency. The commenter suggested that even if the Bureau does not directly regulate a remittance transfer provider, the Bureau could track complaints and launch an investigation if a pattern and practice of non-compliance emerges.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees that it is appropriate to provide the Bureau's contact information, even in instances where the Bureau is not the provider's primary Federal regulator, as required by EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(ii)(II)(bb). The Bureau believes that providing a single Federal agency as the appropriate contact for senders will assist in tracking complaints. The Bureau is not requiring a separate disclosure of a primary Federal regulator in the final rule, because the disclosure of multiple Federal agencies could confuse senders. Instead, the Bureau believes consumers are better served by contacting the Bureau, which can direct senders to the appropriate Federal agency as necessary. Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(2)(vi) in the final rule requires a remittance transfer provider to disclose the contact information for the Bureau, including the toll-free telephone number.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Board requested comment on whether financial institutions that are primarily regulated by Federal banking agencies, such as national banks, should be required to disclose State regulatory agency information. The Board requested comment regarding the circumstances in which it might be appropriate to disclose such a State regulatory agency.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters stated that the rule should only require Federally-chartered depository institutions to provide contact information for their primary Federal regulator. One industry commenter argued that providing information regarding State regulators would be confusing and ineffective, since its primary Federal regulator already has an established procedure for addressing errors.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes the final rule sufficiently accounts for circumstances in which an institution may not be licensed or chartered by a State agency. Under the final rule, the provider must disclose the State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider. However, disclosures must only be disclosed as applicable. Consequently, if no State agency licenses or charters a particular provider, then no State agency is required to be disclosed.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adding several other changes to § 1005.31(b)(2)(vi) in the final rule for clarity. The final rule adds language to allow providers to disclose more than one telephone number for the State agency that licenses or charters the provider and the Bureau to account for circumstances, for example, where these agencies maintain separate TTY/TDD telephone numbers. The provision also adds the requirement that a remittance transfer provider must disclose the name of both the State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider and the Bureau, in addition to the telephone number(s) and Web site of each agency.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(b)(2)(vi) of the final rule states that a remittance transfer must provide a statement that the sender can contact the State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider with respect to the remittance transfer and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for questions or complaints about the remittance transfer provider. The statement must use the language set forth in Model Form A-37 of Appendix A to this part or substantially similar language. The disclosure also must provide the name, telephone number(s), and Web site of the State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider with respect to the remittance transfer and the name, toll-free telephone number(s), and Web site of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(2)-2 has been added to the final rule to clarify that a remittance transfer provider must only disclose information about a State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider with respect to the remittance transfer, as applicable. For example, if a financial institution is solely regulated by a Federal agency, and not licensed or chartered by a State agency, then the institution need not disclose information about a State agency and would solely disclose information about the Bureau, whether or not the Bureau is the provider's primary Federal regulator.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The final rule also adds comment 31(b)(2)-3 to clarify that a remittance transfer provider must only disclose information about one State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider with respect to the remittance transfer, even if other State agencies also regulate the remittance transfer provider. For example, a provider may disclose information about the State agency which granted its license. If a provider is licensed in multiple states, and the State agency that licenses the provider with respect to the remittance transfer is determined by a sender's location, a provider may make the determination as to the State in which the sender is located based on information that is provided by the sender and on any records associated with the sender. For example, if the State agency that licenses the provider with respect to an online remittance transfer is determined by a sender's location, a provider could rely on the sender's statement regarding the State in which the sender is located and disclose the State agency that licenses the provider in that State. A State-chartered bank must disclose information about the State agency that granted its charter, regardless of the location of the sender.</analysisParagraph>
            </analysisSection>
            <analysisSection>
              <title>31(b)(3) Combined Disclosure</title>
              <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(5)(C) grants the Bureau authority to permit a remittance transfer provider to provide to a sender a single written disclosure instead of the pre-payment disclosure and receipt, if the information disclosed is accurate at the time at which payment is made. The combined disclosure must include the content provided in the pre-payment disclosure and the receipt under EFTA sections 919(a)(2)(A) and (B). As discussed above, the Bureau is also requiring providers to disclose some information in the pre-payment disclosure and receipt, such as the transfer amount, that is not specifically required by EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A) or (B). The Board determined through consumer testing that participants understood the information provided on the combined disclosure, and about half of the participants stated that they would prefer to receive the single, combined disclosure rather than a pre-payment disclosure and a separate receipt. Therefore, proposed § 205.31(b)(3) generally permitted a remittance transfer provider to provide the disclosures described in proposed § 205.31(b)(1) and (2) in a single disclosure prior to payment, as applicable, as an alternative to providing the two disclosures described in proposed § 205.31(b)(1) and (2).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters urged the Bureau not to permit combined disclosures. One consumer group commenter stated that requiring both a pre-payment disclosure and a receipt would permit consumers to audit the transaction and ensure that providers do not impose hidden fees. This commenter noted that the combined disclosure would not likely reduce compliance burdens for providers because State laws may already mandate a post-transaction receipt. Another consumer group commenter argued that two disclosures were necessary to perform two different legal functions. This commenter stated that a pre-transaction disclosure serves as an offer that provides terms of written contract, and a receipt indicates that the contract has been agreed upon. This commenter believed a combined disclosure would be too confusing to senders and that the proposed rule did not address how the combined disclosure will ensure information is accurate. Some industry commenters argued that the Bureau should permit the combined disclosure, but maintained that it should be permitted to be provided after payment is made. <em data-original="E-03">See also</em> § 1005.31(e), discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Some consumer testing participants stated that they would prefer to receive a pre-payment disclosure and a receipt because they were concerned that the combined disclosure would not provide proof of payment for the remittance transfer. Therefore, in the proposal, the Board solicited comment on whether proof of payment should also be required for remittance transfer providers using the combined disclosure and, if so, solicited comment on appropriate methods of demonstrating proof of payment for the combined disclosure. Consumer group commenters contended that methods for providing proof of payment could not be adequately set forth in the final rule. An industry commenter argued against requiring proof of payment for the combined disclosure, based on the challenges posed by the required timing of combined disclosures. Another industry commenter maintained that senders were satisfied with the existing proof of payment provided to them.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes a combined disclosure has benefits. Based on the Board's consumer testing, the Bureau believes that senders will understand the combined disclosures provided to them and that some senders will prefer to receive disclosures in a combined format. As discussed with respect to § 1005.31(f), below, the provider must ensure that the combined disclosure is accurate when payment is made. Moreover, the Bureau believes that the combined disclosure could reduce the compliance burden for some providers because the provider would only be required to provide one disclosure, rather than two, with mandated content in a specified format. Therefore, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to permit this alternative disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>However, the Bureau also believes that senders need to be able to confirm that they have completed the transaction. A proof of payment enables senders to demonstrate that the combined disclosure they received was part of a completed transaction. A proof of payment would also help remittance transfer providers determine which transfers have actually been completed, so that a sender cannot assert error resolution rights based on a combined disclosure, where a sender has not made payment for the transfer. Thus, the Bureau is adding a proof of payment requirement to the final rule.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to finalize the combined disclosure requirement. Section 1005.31(b)(3) states that as an alternative to providing the disclosures described in § 1005.31(b)(1) and (2), a remittance transfer provider may provide the disclosures described in § 1005.31(b)(2), as applicable, in a single disclosure pursuant to the timing requirements of § 1005.31(e)(1). If the remittance transfer provider provides the combined disclosure and the sender completes the transfer, the remittance transfer provider must provide the sender with proof of payment when payment is made for the remittance transfer. The proof of payment must be clear and conspicuous, provided in writing or electronically, and provided in a retainable form. The final rule also adds new comment 31(b)(3)-1, which clarifies that the combined disclosure must be provided to the sender when the sender requests the remittance transfer, but prior to payment for the transfer, pursuant to § 1005.31(e)(1), and the proof of payment must be provided when payment is made for the remittance transfer. The comment also clarifies that the proof of payment for the transaction may be provided on the same piece of paper as the combined disclosure or on a separate piece of paper. For example, a provider may feed a combined disclosure through a computer printer when payment is made to add the date and time of the transaction, a confirmation code, and an indication that the transfer was paid in full. A provider may also provide this additional information to a sender on a separate piece of paper when payment is made.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that the use of the term “proof of payment” does not suggest or establish an evidentiary standard. The requirement to provide a sender with proof of payment is only intended to convey to a sender that payment has been received. To this end, new comment 31(b)(3)-1 also clarifies that a remittance transfer provider does not comply with the requirements of § 1005.31(b)(3) by providing a combined disclosure with no further indication that payment has been received.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>31(b)(4) Long Form Error Resolution and Cancellation Notice</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(4) stated that a remittance transfer provider must provide a notice to the sender describing the sender's error resolution and cancellation rights under proposed §§ 205.33 and 205.34 upon the sender's request. As discussed above, consumer group commenters argued that comprehensive error resolution and cancellation rights should be stated on the receipt or combined disclosure in lieu of an abbreviated disclosure, and not only upon request by a sender. The Bureau is retaining the abbreviated disclosure in the final rule. However, the Bureau also believes that a sender must have access to a complete description of the sender's error resolution and cancellation rights.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The requirement to provide a long form error resolution and cancellation notice is adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(b)(4). The final rule adds the requirement that the notice must be provided promptly to the sender. The Bureau believes that adding a timing requirement to the provision will ensure that providers do not delay in providing the notice to a sender, and the requirement to provide notices promptly is consistent with other provisions in Regulation E. <em data-original="E-03">See, e.g.,</em> § 1005.11(d)(1). Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(4) states that, upon the sender's request, a remittance transfer provider must promptly provide to the sender a notice describing the sender's error resolution and cancellation rights, using language set forth in Model Form A-36 of Appendix A to this part or substantially similar language. As discussed above with respect to § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv), the Bureau is adding a requirement in § 1005.31(b)(4) to account for the alternative cancellation requirements in § 1005.36(c) for remittance transfers scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, as discussed below. Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(4) also provides that for any remittance transfer scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, a description of the rights of the sender regarding cancellation must instead reflect the requirements of § 1005.36(c).</analysisParagraph>

            <title>36(b) Accuracy</title>
            <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.36(b) sets forth requirements for the accuracy of disclosures for preauthorized remittance transfers. For the first scheduled transfer, the disclosure requirements follow the accuracy rule set forth in § 1005.31(f) that generally applies to remittance transfers. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.36(b)(1). Thus, except as permitted by § 1005.32, the pre-payment disclosure and receipt provided for the first scheduled transfer must be accurate when payment is made; that is, at the time the transfer is authorized.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>However, for subsequent scheduled transfers, the disclosures described in § 1005.36(a)(2) must be accurate when the transfer is made. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.36(b)(2). Thus, for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers, the final rule provides that senders must receive an accurate pre-payment disclosure shortly before the transfer is made, and then an accurate receipt shortly after the transfer is made. Providers may continue to disclose estimates to the extent permitted by § 1005.32.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau believes that it would be problematic to apply the general rule about accuracy in § 1005.31(f) to subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. For example, some preauthorized remittance transfers are set up to vary in amount, so the provider cannot predict, at the time such transfers are authorized, the amount to be transferred in subsequent months. Therefore, the provider could not provide an accurate pre-payment disclosure and receipt at the time the preauthorized remittance transfers, and payment for the transfers, are authorized. The accuracy requirement in § 1005.31(f) also would present a challenge to determining an applicable exchange rate for subsequent transfers, in that the provider may not know the exchange rate that will apply to subsequent transfers at the time of authorization. Accordingly, to effectuate the purposes of the Act and to facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to adopt special requirements for accurate disclosures about subsequent scheduled transfers in § 1005.36(b). In the January 2012 Proposed Rule published elsewhere in today's <em data-original="E-04">Federal Register</em>, the Bureau is also soliciting comment on the use of estimates for certain disclosures with respect to the first scheduled transfer.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>36(c) Cancellation</title>
            <analysisParagraph>Under § 1005.34(a), senders are permitted to cancel a remittance transfer if the request to cancel the remittance transfer is received by the provider no later than 30 minutes after the sender makes payment in connection with the remittance transfer, if certain conditions are met. As noted above, for purposes of subpart B, payment is made when payment is authorized. The Bureau believes that requiring a sender to cancel a transaction no later than 30 minutes after payment is authorized would not be appropriate for certain remittance transfers that a sender schedules in advance, including preauthorized remittance transfers. Such a rule would permit cancellation only for a short time after the transfers are authorized, even though the remittance transfer may not occur for many days, weeks, or months. For example, if on March 1 a sender scheduled a remittance transfer for March 23, under the general cancellation rule, the sender would be required to cancel 30 minutes after the transfer was authorized on March 1, despite the fact that the transfer is not being made until March 23. The Bureau believes it is appropriate to adopt a different cancellation period in these circumstances because payment is authorized well before the transfer is to be made.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Consequently, the Bureau is adopting a special cancellation rule in § 1005.36(c) that it believes is more appropriate for these types of transfers. Section 1005.36(c) states that, for any remittance transfer scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, a remittance transfer provider shall comply with any oral or written request to cancel the remittance transfer from the sender if the request to cancel: (i) Enables the provider to identify the sender's name and address or telephone number and the particular transfer to be cancelled; and (ii) is received by the provider at least three business days before the scheduled date of the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that this time period is more beneficial to senders because it generally provides them more time to decide whether to go through with a scheduled transfer. Senders will have the opportunity to change their minds about sending a transfer if, for example, circumstances change between when the transfer is authorized and when the transfer is to be made. At the same time, the Bureau believes that requiring a sender to cancel at least three days before a transfer is made gives providers sufficient time to process any cancellation requests before a transfer is made. Many financial institutions that permit senders to schedule remittance transfers at least three business days before the date of the transfer are already subject to the stop payment provisions in Regulation E for preauthorized transfers that are EFTs, which require consumers to notify the institution at least three business days before the scheduled date of a preauthorized EFT. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.10(c).</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The cancellation provisions in both §§ 1005.34(a) and 1005.36(c) permit a sender to cancel a remittance transfer after the transfer has been authorized. Under both provisions, a cancellation period may expire before the transfer itself is made. As noted above, the Bureau expects financial institutions making transfers by ACH or wire transfer may decide to wait to execute the payment order until the cancellation period has passed because these types of remittance transfers generally cannot easily be cancelled once the payment order has been accepted by the sending institution. For the same reason, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to require a sender to cancel before a transfer is made in § 1005.36(c).</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Under § 1005.36(c), a transfer must be cancelled only if the request to cancel is received by the provider at least three business days before the scheduled date of the remittance transfer, so that a provider has sufficient time to prevent the transfer from taking place on the scheduled date. Therefore, under the final rule, only transfers scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer are subject to the cancellation requirements in § 1005.36(c). Remittance transfers that are scheduled less than three business days before the date of the transfer are subject to the cancellation requirements in § 1005.34(a). For example, if a sender on March 1 requests a remittance transfer provider to send a wire transfer to pay a bill in a foreign country on March 3, the sender may cancel up to 30 minutes after scheduling the payment on March 1. Thus, in every case, a sender has an opportunity to cancel a remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting commentary to provide further guidance on the application of § 1005.36(c). Comment 36(c)-1 clarifies that a remittance transfer is scheduled if it will require no further action by the sender to send the transfer after the sender requests the transfer. For example, a remittance transfer is scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, and § 1005.36(c) applies, where a sender on March 1 requests a remittance transfer provider to send a wire transfer to pay a bill in a foreign country on March 15, if it will require no further action by the sender to send the transfer after the sender requests the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Comment 36(c)-1 also clarifies three circumstances where the provisions of § 1005.36(c) do not apply, such that a provider should instead comply with the 30-minute cancellation rule in § 1005.34. For example, § 1005.36(c) does not apply when a sender on March 1 requests a remittance transfer provider to send a wire transfer to pay a bill in a foreign country on March 3. In this instance, § 1005.36(c) does not apply because the transfer is scheduled less than three business days before the date of the transfer. Section 1005.36(c) also does not apply when a sender on March 1 requests that a remittance transfer provider send a remittance transfer on March 15, but the provider requires the sender to confirm the request on March 14 in order to send the transfer. In this example, § 1005.36(c) does not apply because the transfer requires further action by the sender to send the transfer after the sender requests the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The other example in comment 36(c)-1 demonstrates situations where § 1005.36(c) does not apply because a transfer occurs more than three days after the date the sender requests the transfer solely due to the provider's processing time and not because a sender schedules the transfer at least three business days before the date of the transfer. For example, § 1005.36(c) does not apply when a sender on March 1 requests that a remittance transfer provider send an ACH transfer, and that transfer is sent on March 2, but due to the time required for processing, funds are not deducted from the sender's account until March 5.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Comment 36(c)-2 clarifies how a remittance transfer provider should treat requests to cancel preauthorized remittance transfers in a manner consistent with the stop payment provisions of Regulation E. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.10(c) and comment 10(c)-2. The comment clarifies that for preauthorized remittance transfers, the provider must assume the request to cancel applies to all future preauthorized remittance transfers, unless the sender specifically indicates that it should apply only to the next scheduled remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Finally, comment 36(c)-3 clarifies that a financial institution that is also a remittance transfer provider may have both stop payment obligations under § 1005.10 and cancellation obligations under § 1005.36. If a sender cancels a remittance transfer under § 1005.36 with a remittance transfer provider that holds the sender's account, and the transfer is a preauthorized transfer under § 1005.10, then the cancellation provisions of § 1005.36 exclusively apply. The Bureau notes that in these circumstances, a provider would not be permitted to require the sender to give written confirmation of a cancellation within 14 days of an oral notification, as is permitted for stop payment orders in § 1005.10(c)(2). The Bureau believes that a sender should be able to orally cancel any remittance transfer, including a remittance transfer that is scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, without the additional burden of providing written confirmation of the cancellation.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In the January 2012 Proposed Rule published elsewhere in today's <em data-original="E-04">Federal Register</em>, the Bureau is also soliciting comment on the cancellation period for a remittance transfer scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>36(a) Timing</title>
            <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.36(a) sets forth the disclosure timing requirements for disclosures relating to preauthorized remittance transfers. Under § 1005.36(a)(1), for the first scheduled transfer, the provider is required to provide both the pre-payment disclosure described in § 1005.31(b)(1) and the receipt described in § 1005.31(b)(2) in accordance with the timing rules set forth in § 1005.31(e) that generally apply to remittance transfers. In effect, under the final rule, the first scheduled transfer of a preauthorized remittance transfer is treated the same as other individual transfer requests by a sender.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>However, under § 1005.36(a)(2), different timing requirements apply to disclosures relating to subsequent scheduled transfers. Under § 1005.36(a)(2)(i), the provider must mail or deliver a pre-payment disclosure, as described in § 1005.31(b)(1), within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of each subsequent transfer. If the general timing rule in § 1005.31(e) applied, the provider would be required to provide a pre-payment disclosure at the time the scheduled payments are authorized. By requiring a pre-payment disclosure at this alternative time for each subsequent transfer, senders will receive information about their transfers in closer proximity to the scheduled transfer date, and the provider should be in a better position to make the required disclosures. This approach also reminds senders about the pending transfer, which will enable them to confirm that sufficient funds are available for the transfer. In the January 2012 Proposed Rule published elsewhere in today's <em data-original="E-04">Federal Register</em>, the Bureau is also soliciting comment on a safe harbor with respect to the reasonable time requirement.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In addition, under § 1005.36(a)(2)(ii), the provider must provide the receipt described in § 1005.31(b)(2) for each subsequent transfer. As with pre-payment disclosures, the Bureau does not believe a receipt given at the time payment for the transfer is authorized would be as useful to senders as a receipt received closer in time to the actual transfer that contains more relevant information about the particular scheduled transfer. The final rule requires the receipt to be mailed or delivered to the sender no later than one business day after the date on which the transfer is made. However, if the transfer involves the transfer of funds from the sender's account held by the provider, the receipt may be provided on or with the next regularly scheduled periodic statement for that account or within 30 days after payment is made for the remittance transfer if a periodic statement is not provided. Section 1005.36(a)(2)(ii) closely tracks the receipt timing rule for receipts in transactions conducted entirely by telephone under § 1005.31(e)(2).</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that these special timing rules for pre-payment disclosures and receipts for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers will result in more meaningful disclosures to senders than if providers were required to provide these disclosures at the time the transfers were authorized.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>30(h) Third-Party Fees</title>
            <analysisParagraph>As discussed in detail below in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.31, the Bureau is eliminating the requirement to disclose certain recipient institution fees and to include such fees in the calculation of the disclosed amount to be received by the designated recipient.  In order to differentiate between fees that must be disclosed and included in the calculation of the amount to be received and those that are no longer required to be disclosed and included in such calculation, the Bureau is adopting definitions under § 1005.30(h) for covered third-party fees, required to be calculated and disclosed under subpart B of Regulation E, and non-covered third-party fees, which are not required to be calculated and disclosed.  Section 1005.30(h)(1) defines the term “covered third-party fees” to mean any fee that is imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider, except for non-covered third-party fees as described in § 1005.30(h)(2).  Section 1005.30(h)(2) defines the term “non-covered third-party fees” to mean any fees imposed by the designated recipient's institution for receiving a transfer into an account, except if the institution acts as an agent of the remittance transfer provider.  The rationale underlying the distinctions made in these definitions is discussed further below in the discussion of § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi).</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The 2013 Final Rule adds new commentary to 30(h) to explain the scope of these fees.  Drawing from applicable examples of fees imposed by a person other than the remittance transfer provider that were in comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii in the 2012 Final Rule, as well as proposed comments 31(b)(1)-iii and -iv which would have provided additional clarification on how to disclose recipient institution fees, comment 30(h)-1 explains that fees imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider include only those fees that are charged to the designated recipient and are specifically related to the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Comment 30(h)-1 additionally provides examples of fees that are or are not specifically related to the remittance transfer.  For example, overdraft fees that are imposed by a recipient's bank or funds that are garnished from the proceeds of a remittance transfer to satisfy an unrelated debt are not fees imposed on the remittance transfer because these charges are not specifically related to the remittance transfer.  Comment 30(h)-1 further states that account fees are also not specifically related to a remittance transfer if such fees are merely assessed based on general account activity and not for receiving transfers.  Comment 30(h)-1 additionally clarifies that fees that banks charge one another for handling a remittance transfer or other fees that do not affect the total amount that will be received by the designated recipient are not fees imposed on the remittance transfer. Comment 30(h)-1 also clarifies that fees that specifically relate to a remittance transfer may be structured on a flat per-transaction basis, or may be conditioned on other factors (such as account status or the quantity of remittance transfers received) in addition to the remittance transfer itself.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In addition, the 2013 Final Rule adds new commentary to explain the difference between covered and non-covered third-party fees.  Comment 30(h)-2.i explains that under § 1005.30(h)(1), a covered third-party fee means any fee that is imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider including fees imposed by a designated recipient's institution for receiving a transfer into an account where such institution acts as an agent of the provider for the remittance transfer.  As noted above, the rationale for this distinction is discussed further below in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi).  Comment 30(h)-2.ii provides examples of covered third-party fees including fees imposed on a remittance transfer by intermediary institutions in connection with a wire transfer and fees imposed on a remittance transfer by an agent of the provider at pick-up for receiving the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>With respect to non-covered third-party fees, comment 30(h)-3 explains that a non-covered third-party fee means any fee imposed by the designated recipient's institution for receiving a transfer into an account, unless the institution is acting as an agent of the remittance transfer provider.  It further provides as an example that a fee imposed by the designated recipient's institution for receiving an incoming transfer could be a non-covered third-party fee provided such institution is not acting as the agent of the provider.  In addition, comment 30(h)-3 explains that designated recipient's account in § 1005.30(h)(2) refers only to an asset account, regardless of whether it is a consumer asset account, established for any purpose and held by a bank, savings association, credit union, or equivalent institution.  It does not, however, include a credit card, prepaid card, or a virtual account held by an Internet-based or mobile telephone company that is not a bank, savings association, credit union or equivalent institution.  The rationale for this interpretation is also discussed further below in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi).</analysisParagraph>

              <title>34(a) Sender Right of Cancellation and Refund</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.34(a) stated that a remittance transfer provider must comply with a sender's oral or written request to cancel a remittance transfer received no later than one business day from when the sender makes payment in connection with the remittance transfer provider. In the proposal, the Board recognized that remittance transfers sent by ACH or wire transfer generally cannot be cancelled once the payment order has been accepted by the sending institution. <em data-original="E-03">See, e.g.,</em> UCC Article 4A-211 (providing that a payment order cannot be cancelled or amended once it has been accepted unless the receiving bank agrees or a funds-transfer system rule allows cancellation or amendment without agreement of the bank). The Board stated that it believed that under such circumstances, a bank or credit union making transfers by ACH or wire transfer would likely wait to execute the payment order until the cancellation period had passed, which could delay the receipt of the funds in the foreign country. The Board stated that one business day would provide a reasonable time frame for a sender to evaluate whether to cancel a remittance transfer after providing payment for the transfer, but requested comment regarding whether the proposed minimum time period should be longer or shorter than proposed.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters objected to the proposed cancellation right. One industry commenter believed a cancellation right was unnecessary for remittance transfers because fees incurred by the sender for a remittance transfer were minimal. A Federal Reserve Bank commenter argued that a cancellation right would give senders less incentive to provide accurate information. One industry commenter believed senders could use the cancellation right to take advantage of more favorable exchange rates. The industry commenter believed remittance transfer providers would increase exchange rates to compensate for the risk of loss.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Industry and trade group commenters agreed with the Board that the proposed cancellation period would delay processing routine remittance transfers because remittance transfers sent by ACH or wire transfer would likely be held until the cancellation period passed. Some industry commenters believed that the delay in processing would make it more difficult to determine an exchange rate. A member of Congress urged the Bureau to take into consideration senders' expectation for timely execution of remittance transfers in determining the appropriate cancellation period. A Federal Reserve Bank commenter believed a sender would want to remit funds as quickly as possible, and that the proposed cancellation right could cause senders to make payments using remittance mechanisms that are not subject to Regulation E.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters believed that the Bureau should require a one business day cancellation period, but suggested that the Bureau study when cancellations typically occur. These commenters suggested that a study could help the Bureau determine that decreasing the cancellation period could adequately protect senders. Many industry commenters believed that if the Bureau required a cancellation period, the period should be shorter than one business day. The commenters suggested a variety of shorter cancellation periods that could be more appropriate. Some industry commenters believed the cancellation period should be shortened to the same day or an hour. Several industry commenters believed the right to cancel should end when the remittance transfer provider executes the payment instruction. Several industry commenters believed the cancellation period should be shortened to 30 minutes, noting that this time period would be consistent with Texas law.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters suggested that institutions sending remittance transfers through ACH or wire transfer should be exempt from the cancellation rules. Other industry commenters suggested that a sender should have the right to opt out of the cancellation right to have the transfer sent immediately. Another industry commenter suggested that the provider should only be required to cancel if the provider has a reasonable opportunity to act upon the request. One industry commenter believed a right to refund remittance transfers that are unclaimed was a more appropriate cancellation policy. An industry commenter believed the provider should not be required to honor cancellation requests that are made for fraudulent purposes.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Other industry commenters believed the cancellation rules should be disclosure-based. One industry commenter believed that instead of a cancellation right, the provider should disclose that once a sender signs the remittance transaction agreement, it cannot be cancelled and that a failure to carry out a sender's cancellation request once a remittance agreement has been signed is not an error. Another industry commenter believed that if a provider had a cancellation policy, that the Bureau should require that it be properly disclosed.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that a cancellation right could be helpful to senders of remittance transfers. The Bureau also believes, however, that providers sending remittance transfers through ACH or wire transfer likely will delay transactions for the length of the cancellation period because such transfers are often difficult to retract once they are sent. A cancellation period of one business day thus could prevent a sender from sending a remittance transfer quickly. In addition, a long cancellation period could create an unfair competitive advantage for closed network money transmitters, who are less likely to delay sending a remittance transfer until the end of the cancellation period. Therefore, the Bureau believes a cancellation period shorter than one business day is appropriate.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The final rule requires a 30-minute cancellation period.<footnote ref="83">The 30-minute cancellation period is the same time period as the remittance transfer cancellation period under Texas law. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; TX Admin. Code § 278.052, which provides that a consumer may cancel a transfer for any reason within 30 minutes of initiating the transfer provided the customer has not left the premises. Unlike the Texas law, under § 1005.34(a), a sender may cancel within 30 minutes, regardless of whether the sender has left the premises.</footnote>
                A 30-minute cancellation period provides the sender the opportunity to review both the pre-payment disclosure and the receipt to ensure that the transfer was sent as the sender intended. However, the 30-minute cancellation period should not substantially delay transactions for senders who want to send funds quickly. The Bureau notes that 30 minutes is the minimum time that a provider must allow senders to cancel transactions, but providers may choose to permit senders to cancel transactions after the 30 minute period has passed. Moreover, even after the cancellation period has passed, senders may still assert their rights under § 1005.33 and obtain a refund or other remedy for transactions where an error occurred.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the final rule sets forth new cancellation requirements in a new § 1005.36 with respect to certain remittance transfers that a sender schedules in advance, including preauthorized remittance transfers. As discussed below, the Bureau believes that when a sender schedules a remittance transfer more than three days in advance of when the remittance transfer is made, a cancellation period tied to when the transfer is made, rather than when the transfer is authorized, is more beneficial to a sender. In those circumstances, the Bureau believes a sender should have the flexibility to cancel the transfer more than 30 minutes after scheduling the transfer to be made, given the potentially significant delay between when the sender authorizes the remittance transfer and when the sender schedules the remittance transfer to be made. Circumstances could change in the intervening period that would negate the purpose of the transfer. At the same time, allowing the sender to cancel certain remittance transfers that a sender schedules in advance for up to 30 minutes after the transfer is made could be burdensome to both senders and providers. A sender may not know the precise time of day that the transfer is scheduled, and such a rule would extend the period of uncertainty for providers, who may delay a transfer until the cancellation period has expired. Consequently, the 30-minute cancellation period described in § 1005.34(a) does not apply to remittance transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, and a remittance transfer provider must instead comply with the cancellation requirements in § 1005.36(c).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.34(a) of the final rule provides that, except as provided in § 1005.36(c), a remittance transfer provider shall comply with the requirements of § 1005.34 with respect to any oral or written request to cancel a remittance transfer from the sender that is received by the provider no later than 30 minutes after the sender makes payment in connection with the remittance transfer, if the following two conditions are met.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>First, under proposed § 205.34(a)(1), a valid request to cancel a remittance transfer must enable the provider to identify the sender's name and address or telephone number and the particular transfer to be cancelled. Proposed comment 34(a)-1 clarified that the request to cancel a remittance transfer is valid so long as the remittance transfer provider is able to identify the remittance transfer in question. For example, the sender could provide the confirmation number or code that would be used by the designated recipient to pick up the transfer, or other identification number or code supplied by the provider in connection with the transfer. The proposed comment also permitted the provider to request, or the sender to provide, the sender's email address instead of a physical address, so long as the provider can identify the transfer to which the cancellation request applies.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Second, proposed § 205.34(a)(2) provided that a sender's timely request to cancel a remittance transfer is effective so long as the transferred funds have not been picked up by the designated recipient or deposited into an account held by the recipient.<footnote ref="84">As discussed in the proposal, such accounts need not be accounts held by a financial institution so long as the recipient may access the transferred funds without any restrictions regarding the use of such funds. For example, some Internet-based providers may track consumer funds in a virtual account or wallet and permit the holder of the account or wallet to make purchases or withdraw funds once funds are credited to the account or wallet.</footnote>
                Proposed comment 34(a)-2 reiterated that a remittance transfer provider must include an abbreviated notice of the sender's right to cancel a remittance transfer in the receipt or combined notice, as applicable. In addition, the proposed comment clarified that the remittance transfer provider must make available to a sender upon request, a notice providing a full description of the right to cancel a remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comment on the two conditions on the right to cancel. The final rule adopts the two conditions as proposed in renumbered § 1005.34(a)(1) and (a)(2). In addition, the Bureau adopts comments 34(a)-1 and 34(a)-2 substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adding comment 34(a)-3 to explain how a remittance transfer provider could comply with the cancellation and refund requirements of § 1005.34 if the cancellation request is received by the provider no later than 30 minutes after the sender makes payment. The comment states that a provider may, at its option, provide a longer time period for cancellation. The comment clarifies that a provider must provide the 30-minute cancellation right regardless of the provider's normal business hours. For example, if an agent closes less than 30 minutes after the sender makes payment, the provider could opt to take cancellation requests through the telephone number disclosed on the receipt. The provider could also set a cutoff time after which the provider will not accept requests to send a remittance transfer. For example, a financial institution that closes at 5:00 p.m. could stop accepting payment for remittance transfers after 4:30 p.m.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter believed that the Bureau should require a sender to contact the remittance transfer provider directly in order to cancel a transaction. The commenter believed that agents should not be required to handle cancellation requests, noting that under certain State laws, the agent does not have a right to the funds paid for a remittance transfer and therefore could not make a refund.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that a sender's cancellation request should be valid if the sender contacts the agent. Many participants in consumer testing indicated that they would contact an agent first if they encountered a problem with their remittance transfer. The Bureau also believes that requiring a sender to contact a remittance transfer provider by, for example, calling the telephone number listed on the receipt could frustrate the sender's ability to cancel within the 30-minute cancellation period. Consequently, the Bureau clarifies in comment 34(a)-4 that a cancellation request provided by a sender to an agent of the remittance transfer provider is deemed to be received by the provider under § 1005.34(a) when received by the agent. The Bureau understands, however, that an agent may not be able to provide a sender with the refund for legal or operational reasons, and, as discussed below, the final rule does not require an agent to provide a refund if the agent is unable to do so.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau is adding a comment to clarify when a sender makes a payment for a remittance transfer, for purposes of determining when the 30-minute cancellation period has passed. Comment 34(a)-5 clarifies that, for purposes of subpart B, payment is made, for example, when a sender provides cash to the remittance transfer provider or when payment is authorized.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>34(b) Time Limits and Refund Requirements</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.34(b) established the time frames and refund requirements applicable to remittance transfer cancellation requests. The proposed rule stated that a remittance transfer provider must refund, at no additional cost to the sender, the total amount of funds tendered by the sender in connection with the remittance transfer, including any fees imposed in connection with the requested transfer, within three business days of receiving the sender's valid cancellation request.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters objected to the requirement in the May 2011 Proposed Rule to refund the total amount of funds to the sender. Industry commenters believed that requiring a refund of the total amount of funds raised significant safety and soundness concerns for institutions sending wire transfers because some remittance transfer providers would be unable to recover the funds from subsequent institutions in a transfer chain. One money transmitter commenter stated that once a transfer is booked at an agent location, the provider is obligated to pay the agent its portion of the transfer fees for the transaction. If a sender cancels the transaction after settlement, the provider would be required to negotiate the return of the fee from the agent or bear the total loss of the fee. Similarly, the commenter noted that it acted as an agent of international billers and is obligated to the billers for the funds when it sends data to the biller. Several industry commenters believed requiring a remittance transfer provider to refund all fees could increase costs for senders, since providers may increase fees to account for losses due to refund. A money transmitter commenter also argued that refunding a third party fee or tax could be impermissible under local law.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters suggested that the Bureau permit a remittance transfer provider to charge reasonable fees, even if the sender cancels the transaction. Some of the commenters noted that this was consistent with a bank's ability to charge fees in connection with a stop payment order on a check to cover the bank's costs. An industry trade association believed providers should be permitted to charge a $45 fee to stop the transaction. Another industry commenter suggested that if the exchange rate changes between the time the order is placed and the refund is requested such that the amount of local currency originally promised would be equivalent to less U.S. dollars, the refund of the principal should be at the new exchange rate.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Some commenters believed a remittance transfer provider should not be required to provide a refund in certain circumstances. One industry commenter believed a provider should not be required to refund fees charged by intermediaries. Another industry commenter suggested that a provider should not have to refund the portion of any fees that are not attributable to costs incurred by them prior to receiving a cancellation request. A trade association believed a provider should not be required to refund fees when the provider has not made any errors.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes it is appropriate to require a provider to refund the total amount of funds provided by the sender in connection with the remittance transfer. The Bureau believes senders could be discouraged from exercising their cancellation rights if they could not recover the cost of the remittance transfer. Although the Bureau recognizes that a provider may not be able to recover some fees or taxes charged for a transfer, the Bureau believes that the shorter cancellation period adopted in the final rule helps address these concerns. Under the final rule, a provider can mitigate some of the risk of losing fees or taxes charged for a transfer by sending a transfer after the 30-minute cancellation period ends. Therefore, the Bureau is requiring the total amount of funds provided by the sender to be refunded in the final rule in § 1005.34(b) with the additional clarification that refunding the total amount of funds provided by the sender in connection with a remittance transfer requires a provider to refund taxes on the remittance transfer. However, as noted by one industry commenter, for certain jurisdictions, the remittance transfer provider may be prohibited by law from refunding taxes. Consequently, the requirement in § 1005.34(b) to refund taxes is only to the extent such refund is not prohibited by law. In the final rule, § 1005.34(b) provides that a remittance transfer provider shall refund, at no additional cost to the sender, the total amount of funds provided by the sender in connection with a remittance transfer, including any fees and, to the extent not prohibited by law, taxes imposed in connection with the remittance transfer, within three business days of receiving a sender's request to cancel the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 34(b)-1 addressed the permissible ways in which a provider could provide a refund. The proposed comment clarified that a remittance transfer provider may, at the provider's discretion, issue a refund in cash or in the same form of payment that was initially tendered by the sender for the remittance transfer. For example, if the sender originally provided a credit card as payment for the transfer, the remittance transfer provider may issue a credit to the sender's credit card account in the amount of the payment.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comment on proposed comment 34(b)-1. However, as discussed above regarding comment 33(c)-6, the Bureau is amending comment 34(b)-1 with respect to refunds if a sender initially provided cash for the remittance transfer. Specifically, comment 34(b)-1 states that a provider may issue a refund by check if a sender initially provided cash for the remittance transfer. For example, if the sender originally provided cash as payment for the transfer, the provider may mail a check to the sender in the amount of the payment.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also finalizing comment 34(b)-2, which addresses costs that must be refunded upon a sender's timely request to cancel a remittance transfer. The comment is adopted substantially as proposed, with amendments clarifying that all funds provided by the sender in connection with the remittance transfer would include taxes that are assessed by a State or other governmental body, to the extent not prohibited by law. Therefore, the final comment states that if a sender provides a timely request to cancel a remittance transfer, a remittance transfer provider must refund all funds provided by the sender in connection with the remittance transfer, including any fees and, to the extent not prohibited by law, taxes that have been imposed for the transfer, whether the fee or tax was assessed by the provider or a third party, such as an intermediary institution, the agent or bank in the recipient country, or a State or other governmental body.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Finally, industry commenters suggested amendments to the requirement in the proposal to provide a refund within three business days of receiving a sender's request to cancel the remittance transfer. One industry commenter believed the refund rule should not require the refund to be delivered to the sender within three business days. The commenter cited examples of when it could be difficult to deliver the funds to the sender in three days, such as when the provider mails a refund check and the check takes several days to be delivered to the sender; when the refund is available at an agent location, but the sender takes several days to pick-up the refund; and when the provider issues a chargeback to the sender's credit or debit card account, but the credit takes several days to appear due to card processing systems. The Bureau notes that the requirement to refund funds to a sender does not require a provider to ensure that a refund is delivered to a sender within three business days after receiving the sender's request to cancel the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.30(a) stated that an “agent” means an agent, authorized delegate, or person affiliated with a remittance transfer provider under State or other applicable law, when such agent, authorized delegate, or affiliate acts for that remittance transfer provider. The final rule adopts the definition as proposed in renumbered § 1005.30(a).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919 does not use consistent terminology concerning agents of remittance transfer providers. For example, EFTA section 919(f)(1) uses the phrase “agent, authorized delegate, or person affiliated with a remittance transfer provider,” when that person “acts for that remittance transfer provider,” while other provisions use the phrase “agent or authorized delegate” (EFTA section 919(f)(2)) or simply “agent” (EFTA section 919(b)). The Bureau does not believe that these statutory wording differences are intended to establish different standards across the rule. Therefore, the rule generally refers to “agents,” as defined in § 1005.30(a), to provide consistency across the rule.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Commenters suggested that the Bureau provide further clarity on the definition of “agent,” including clarifying that financial institutions' relationships with intermediary and correspondent institutions are not agency relationships unless an agreement creates such a relationship as a matter of law. The final rule does not contain these suggested clarifications. The Bureau believes that because the concept of agency has historically been defined by common law, it is appropriate for the definition to defer to applicable law regarding agents, including with respect to what creates or constitutes an agency relationship.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>30(b) Business Day</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Several provisions in the final rule use the term “business day.” <em data-original="E-03">See, e.g.,</em> §§ 1005.31(e)(2) and 1005.33(c)(1). Because the definition of “business day” in § 1005.2(d) of Regulation E applies only to financial institutions and includes inapt commentary, the Board proposed an alternative definition of “business day” applicable to remittance transfer providers. The proposed rule stated that “business day” means any day on which a remittance transfer provider accepts funds for sending remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Commenters generally objected to the proposed definition. In particular, financial institution commenters expressed concern that the date on which an institution “accepts funds” is unclear, because it could be interpreted either as the date on which funds are deposited into an account, or when the institution accepts a sender's order to transfer funds. Other commenters suggested replacing the proposed definition with a definition closer to the definition of “business day” in § 1005.2(d) Regulation E. Upon further review, and for greater consistency among definitions, the Bureau is adopting a revised “business day” definition in renumbered § 1005.30(b) as explained in related commentary that more closely tracks the general definition of “business day” in § 1005.2(d), but that is tailored to the particular aspects of remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Specifically, § 1005.30(b) states that “business day” means any day on which the offices of a remittance transfer provider are open to the public for carrying on substantially all business functions. Similar to proposed comment 30(b)-1, final comment 30(b)-1 clarifies that with respect to subpart B, a business day includes the entire 24-hour period ending at midnight, and a notice given under any section of subpart B is effective even if given outside of normal business hours. However, comment 30(b)-1 states that a remittance transfer provider is not required under subpart B to make telephone lines available on a 24-hour basis.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Comment 30(b)-2 explains that “substantially all business functions” include both the public and the back-office operations of the provider. For example, if the offices of a provider are open on Saturdays for customers to request remittance transfers, but not for performing internal functions (such as investigating errors), then Saturday is not a business day for that provider. In this case, Saturday does not count toward the business-day standard for subpart B for purposes of determining the number of days for resolving errors, processing refunds, etc.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Comment 30(b)-3 clarifies that a provider may determine, at its election, whether an abbreviated day is a business day. For example, if a provider engages in substantially all business functions until noon on Saturdays instead of its usual 3 p.m. closing, it may consider Saturday a business day. Finally, comment 30(b)-4 states that if a provider makes a telephone line available on Sundays for cancelling the transfer, but performs no other business functions, Sunday is not a business day under the “substantially all business functions” standard.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>30(c) Designated Recipient</title>
              <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(g)(1) provides that “designated recipient” means “any person located in a foreign country and identified by the sender as the authorized recipient of a remittance transfer to be made by a remittance transfer provider, except that a designated recipient shall not be deemed to be a consumer for purposes of [the EFTA].” Proposed § 205.30(c) implemented EFTA section 919(g)(1), with several edits for clarity. First, the Board proposal noted that a remittance transfer provider will generally only know the location where funds are to be sent, rather than where a designated recipient is physically located. For instance, although the sender may indicate that funds are to be sent to the recipient in Mexico City, the recipient could actually be in the United States at the time of the transfer. Thus, the Board stated that the statutory reference to a “person located in a foreign country” should be read with a view to the location where funds are to be sent. Additionally, the statute references a remittance transfer “to be made by a remittance transfer provider.” As discussed below, the definition of “remittance transfer” requires that it be sent by a remittance transfer provider, so this language is unnecessary. Accordingly, proposed § 205.30(c) stated that a designated recipient is any person specified by the sender as an authorized recipient of a remittance transfer to be received at a location in a foreign country. The final rule adopts the proposed rule as proposed in renumbered § 1005.30(c), but with additional explanatory commentary to address issues raised by commenters.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 30(c)-1 stated that a designated recipient can be either a natural person or a business. Several commenters argued that transfers to entities other than natural persons should be excluded, so that the rule would cover only consumer-to-consumer transfers. However, the statute clearly anticipates covering consumer-to-business transfers, as it defines “designated recipient” to include transfers to “persons,” and does not limit its application to consumer recipients. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 15 U.S.C. 1693p(g)(1). The EFTA defines “consumer” to mean a natural person, but does not define the term “person.” Nonetheless, the EFTA uses the term “person” in many provisions, and the context of how the term “person” is used in those EFTA provisions indicates that it includes entities that are natural persons, as well as organizations. For example, the EFTA defines the term “financial institution” to mean “a State or National bank, a State or Federal savings and loan association, a mutual savings bank, a State or Federal credit union, or any <em data-original="E-03">other</em> person who, directly or indirectly, holds an account belonging to a consumer.” (emphasis added). As a result, Regulation E has long defined “person” to mean a natural person or an organization. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.2(j). The Bureau believes that the statute by using the term “person” intended to cover remittance transfers sent by consumers not just to family members, but also directly to businesses abroad to pay tuition, mortgage, medical, utilities, or other bills or to fulfill other obligations. Accordingly, the final rule does not generally exclude consumer-to-business transfers where a remittance transfer provider is acting as an electronic intermediary. Instead, the Bureau is adopting comment 30(c)-1 to state that a designated recipient can be either a natural person or an organization, such as a corporation.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 30(c)-2 explained that a remittance transfer is received at a location in a foreign country if funds are to be received at a location physically outside of any State.<footnote ref="67">The term “State” is defined in 12 CFR 1005.2(l).</footnote>
                One money transmitter commenter noted that it may know the country to which a transfer is being sent, but not the specific payout location. The comment was intended to address the receipt of funds at a foreign location in the general sense; that is, any location that is outside of a State. Thus, the final comment, adopted as renumbered comment 30(c)-2.i., clarifies that a sender need not designate a specific pick-up location.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In addition, commenters requested further clarification for determining whether there is a designated recipient when a transfer is made to an account. For example, in a wire transfer transaction, commenters stated that the consumer requesting the transfer may only identify the recipient of funds by an account number or the location or routing number of the receiving institution. Other commenters argued that transfers to an account associated with an institution in a State should not be viewed as transfers to a designated recipient, even if a person in a foreign country has exclusive access to the account.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>New comment 30(c)-2.ii. provides further guidance to address these issues. For transfers to a designated recipient's account, comment 30(c)-2.ii. states that whether funds are to be received at a location physically outside of any State depends on where the account is located. If the account is located in a State, the funds will not be received at a location in a foreign country.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau concurs with the Board's statement that the statutory reference to a “person located in a foreign country” should be read with a view to the location where funds are to be sent, and believes that comment 30(c)-2.ii. is consistent with this approach. Thus, the Bureau agrees that transfers to domestic accounts should not be considered transfers to a location in a foreign country. The Bureau also agrees that providers may not always know where a recipient is physically located at the time a consumer requests a transfer to be sent, and believes that directing providers to look to the location of the account, rather than the location of the individual recipient, creates an appropriate bright line that will facilitate compliance with the final rule, ease compliance burden, and most effectively accomplish the purpose of the statute to apply the provisions to transfers to foreign countries.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>One commenter suggested revising the definition of “designated recipient” to exclude senders, such that transfers made by a sender to a sender's separate account abroad would be excluded. However, nothing in the statute indicates that the definition of “designated recipient” should exclude transfers to a foreign-based account of the sender. The Bureau believes that a sender would also benefit from disclosures indicating the ultimate amount to be received in a transfer, particularly where an exchange rate is applied. The final rule adopts comment 30(c)-3 to clarify that a sender may also be a designated recipient, such as where a sender requests that a provider send an electronic transfer of funds from the sender's checking account in a State to the sender's checking account located in a foreign country.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Board solicited comment on whether there could be instances where a remittance provider may receive a recipient's email address but no other information to determine the location where funds are to be received. Several commenters affirmed this could happen. For example, one commenter stated that consumers can provide a recipient's email address to use its transfer service; while recipients must register with the provider to access the transferred funds, it is possible that the provider would not know whether the transferred funds will be received at a location in a foreign country until the funds are claimed.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Final comment 30(c)-2.iii. addresses this scenario. Where the sender does not specify information about a recipient's account, but instead just provides information about the recipient, a remittance transfer provider must determine whether the funds will be received at a location in a foreign country based on information that is provided by the sender, and other information the provider may have, at the time the transfer is requested. For example, if a consumer gives a provider the recipient's email address, and the provider has no other information about whether the funds will be received by the recipient at a location in a foreign country, then the provider may determine that funds are not to be received at a location in a foreign country. However, if the provider has additional information at the time the transfer is requested indicating that funds are to be received in a foreign country, such as where the recipient's email address is registered with the provider and associated with a foreign account, then the provider has sufficient information to conclude that the remittance transfer is to be received at a location in a foreign country.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Commenters also noted that, with regard to prepaid cards, the provider may not know at the time the prepaid card is purchased whether the funds will be received at a location physically outside of any State. These commenters stated that where general-purpose reloadable prepaid cards or payroll cards are issued to two persons—one person in a State and another person in a foreign country—and both cards access the same funds, the provider may not be able to ascertain at the time of the request for the cards that funds will be received at a location physically outside of any State. In this case, the issuer does not know at the time of the request the ultimate recipient of the funds.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that funds that can be accessed by a prepaid card are generally not considered to be an “account” as defined in § 1005.2(b) of Regulation E. Thus, where the funds that can be accessed by a prepaid card are held does not determine whether a prepaid card is being issued to a designated recipient. The Bureau believes when a participant in a prepaid card program, such as a prepaid card issuer or a prepaid card program manager, issues prepaid cards, the participant in the prepaid card program must look to where it or another participant in the prepaid card program sends the prepaid cards, to determine whether the prepaid card funds will be received in a foreign country. Likewise, when a participant in a prepaid card program adds additional funds at the sender's direct request to prepaid cards that it or any other participant previously issued, the participant in the prepaid card program must look to where it or another participant in the prepaid card program has sent the cards to determine whether the prepaid card funds will be received in a foreign country. The Bureau does not believe that it is appropriate for a participant in the prepaid card program to determine whether the funds will be received in a foreign country based on where the participants have decided to hold the funds the cards access. The Bureau believes that such a rule would allow participants in the prepaid card program to circumvent the remittance transfer rules by holding the funds in a State. Under such an approach, participants in the prepaid card program would not be required to comply with the remittance transfer rules if the funds are located in a State even where prepaid cards that access the funds are sent only to recipients located in a foreign country.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In the case where two prepaid cards are issued to two persons—one person in a State and another person in a foreign country—and both cards access the same funds, the Bureau believes that the provider has sufficient information to determine that the funds will be received in a foreign country because it has sent one of the prepaid cards to a person in a foreign country. Proposed comment 30(d)-3 suggested that in this situation, the transfer would not be to a designated recipient because the sender retained the ability to draw down the funds on the prepaid card. Proposed comment 30(d)-3 is not adopted. The Bureau is concerned that if it adopted a rule that the transfer is not to a designated recipient in this case, a provider that sends prepaid cards abroad with the intent of providing a service where funds loaded in a State are intended to be accessed in a foreign country could circumvent the remittance transfer rules by always automatically providing a second prepaid card to the sender, even if the sender did not request a second card.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Thus, final comment 30(c)-2.iii. clarifies that if a consumer in a State purchases a prepaid card, the provider has sufficient information to conclude that the funds are to be received in a foreign country if the remittance transfer provider sends a prepaid card to a specified recipient in a foreign country, even if a person located in a State, including the sender, retains the ability to access funds on the prepaid card. In this case, the prepaid issuer knows at the time of the request that a prepaid card has been sent to a recipient located in a foreign country. In contrast, if the provider provides the card directly to the consumer, the provider may conclude that funds are not to be received in a foreign country, because the provider does not know whether the consumer will subsequently send the prepaid card to a recipient in a foreign country.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisParagraph>In the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the Board requested comment on the treatment of preauthorized bill payments under the definition of “remittance transfer.” This issue, and its resolution, are discussed in more detail below in the discussions of § 1005.30(e) and new § 1005.36.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The term “preauthorized electronic fund transfer” is currently defined under 12 CFR 1005.2(k) to mean an “electronic fund transfer authorized in advance to recur at substantially regular intervals.” Because subpart B applies to more than just EFTs, the final rule includes a new definition of “preauthorized remittance transfer” in § 1005.30(d). The definition tracks the definition in § 1005.2(k), but revises its applicability to “remittance transfers authorized in advance to recur at substantially regular intervals.” Similarly, the final rule adopts a new comment 30(d)-1 that tracks existing comment 2(k)-1, but with references to remittance transfers replacing references to EFTs.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>30(f) Remittance Transfer Provider</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.30(e) incorporated the definition of “remittance transfer provider” from EFTA section 919(g)(3). Proposed § 205.30(e) stated that a remittance transfer provider (or provider) means any person that provides remittance transfers for a consumer in the normal course of its business, regardless of whether the consumer holds an account with such person. To eliminate redundancy, the proposed rule revised statutory references to “any person or financial institution” to “any person,” because the term “person” under Regulation E includes financial institutions. Proposed comment 30(e)-1 clarified that an agent is not deemed to be a remittance transfer provider by merely providing remittance transfer services on behalf of the remittance transfer provider. The proposed regulation is adopted generally as proposed in renumbered § 1005.30(f). Comment 30(f)-1 is revised for clarity to state that a person is not deemed to be acting as a remittance transfer provider when it performs activities as an agent on behalf of a remittance transfer provider. New comments 30(f)-2 and -3 are added as described below. The Bureau notes that this comment 30(f)-1 applies only for purposes of this rule. In other contexts, a person may act as a provider when it performs activities on behalf of a provider.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>Normal Course of Business</title>
                <analysisParagraph>The Board solicited comment on whether guidance should be adopted interpreting the phrase “normal course of business” based on the number of remittance transfers in a given year. Many industry commenters argued that the final rule should provide for a <em data-original="E-03">de minimis</em> exception based on the number of remittance transfers sent in a given time period, although one credit union commenter stated that it could be difficult to track numbers. Suggestions ranged from 1,200 or fewer transfers annually to 2,400 transfers annually, per method (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> 2,400 wire transfers plus 2,400 international ACH transfers).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The commenters did not provide any data on the overall distribution and frequency of remittance transfers across various providers to support treating such high numbers of transactions as being outside the normal course of business. Nor did they suggest other means of determining when remittance transfer providers are engaging in transfers merely as an accommodation to occasional consumer requests rather than part of a business of payment services. Absent significant additional information, the Bureau is skeptical that Congress intended to exclude companies averaging 100 or more remittance transfer providers per month from the statutory scheme. Based on the data presented by commenters, such a range would appear to exclude the majority of providers of open network transfers, such as international wire transfers and ACH transactions, from the rule. For example, one trade association commenter stated that most respondents to an information request said that they make fewer than 2,400 international transactions per year. As discussed above, the Bureau believes that the statute clearly covers open network transfers, such as wire transfers and ACH transactions. Providing an exception based on the ranges suggested by these commenters would allow many financial institutions that arguably regularly and in the normal course of business provide remittance transfers to not be subject to the regulation. The Bureau believes in general that the term “normal course of business” covers remittance transfer activities at a level significantly lower than the ranges suggested by these commenters.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In other contexts, regulatory coverage is triggered by a relatively small number of transactions. For example, under Regulation Z, 12 CFR part 1026, a creditor is a person who regularly extends consumer credit under specified circumstances. A person regularly extends consumer credit when it extends consumer credit more than 25 times in the preceding calendar year or in the current year (and five times for transactions secured by a dwelling, or even one time for certain high-cost mortgages).<footnote ref="73">The Bureau notes that it has issued a separate notice of request for information in which the Bureau requests comment on whether it should revise these threshold numbers in Regulation Z. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 76 FR 75825 (Dec. 5, 2011).</footnote>
                  <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 12 CFR 1026.2(a)(17). Under State law, a single money transmission may trigger a requirement to register as a money transmitter.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe it has sufficient information on the frequency with which entities engage in remittance transfers to set a specific numerical threshold based on the current administrative record. Accordingly, the final rule adopts a new comment 30(f)-2 addressing “normal course of business.” Comment 30(f)-2 states that whether a person provides remittance transfers in the normal course of business depends on the facts and circumstances, including the total number and frequency of remittance transfers sent by the provider. For example, if a financial institution generally does not make international consumer wire transfers available to customers, but sends a couple of international consumer wire transfers in a given year as an accommodation for a customer, the institution does not provide remittance transfers in the normal course of business. In contrast, if a financial institution makes international consumer wire transfers generally available to customers (whether described in the institution's deposit account agreement, or in practice) and makes transfers multiple times per month, the institution provides remittance transfers in the normal course of business.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>While the final comment does not include a numerical threshold for “normal course of business,” the Bureau recognizes that a bright-line number may ease compliance. Thus, in the January 2012 Proposed Rule, published elsewhere in the <em data-original="E-04">Federal Register</em> today, the Bureau is soliciting further comment on a potential safe harbor threshold.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>Multiple Remittance Transfer Providers</title>
                <analysisParagraph>New comment 30(f)-3 provides guidance where more than one remittance transfer provider is involved in providing a remittance transfer. The Bureau recognizes that in some situations more than one remittance transfer provider may be involved in providing a remittance transfer. For example, prepaid card programs may involve, among others: (i) A program sponsor that establishes the program relationships, identifies and procures the necessary parties and sets contractual terms and conditions; (ii) a program manager which functions as a day-to-day operations “control center” for the program; and (iii) an issuing bank whose contractual involvement is required to invoke the payment network and which also may serve as the holder of funds that have been prepaid and are awaiting instructions to be disbursed. Any and all of these entities may be a “remittance transfer provider” if they meet the definition as set forth in § 1005.30(f).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Comment 30(f)-3 provides that if the remittance transfer involves more than one remittance transfer provider, only one set of disclosures must be given, and the remittance transfer providers must agree among themselves which provider must take the actions necessary to comply with the requirements that subpart B imposes on any or all of them. Even though the providers must designate one provider to take the actions necessary to comply with the requirements that subpart B imposes on any or all of them, all remittance transfer providers involved in the remittance transfer remain responsible for compliance with the applicable provisions of the EFTA and Regulation E.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>30(g) Sender</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.30(f) incorporated the definition of “sender” from EFTA section 919(g)(4) with minor edits for clarity. Specifically, proposed § 205.30(f) defined “sender” to mean “a consumer in a state who requests a remittance transfer provider to send a remittance transfer to a designated recipient.” The final rule adopts the definition largely as proposed in renumbered § 1005.30(g), with additional clarifications and a new explanatory comment.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Several commenters suggested that the Bureau limit remittance transfers to those sent for personal, family, or household purposes. Although Regulation E's applicability is generally limited to such consumer-purpose transactions, the limitation is contained in the definition of “account” in § 1005.2(b). However, the remittance transfer rule applies to more than just account-based transfers. As a result, these commenters stated that an individual who requests a transfer for business purposes could arguably be a “sender” under the rule.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>To address these concerns, the Bureau is revising the definition of “sender” in § 1005.30(g) to clarify that a sender is a consumer in a State who primarily for personal, family, or household purposes requests a remittance transfer provider to send a remittance transfer to a designated recipient. This revision is consistent with § 1005.2(b) and clarifies that the final rule does not apply to business-to-consumer or business-to-business transactions or to transactions that are not for personal, family or household purposes. For example, a transfer requested by a sole proprietor on behalf of his or her company would not be covered by the rule.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As with the definition of “designated recipient,” some commenters requested guidance as to how they should determine whether a consumer is located in a State for account-based transfers. Commenters also requested clarification on how to determine where a consumer is located if the transfer request is made electronically or by telephone, and where the consumer's presence is not readily apparent. To address these questions, new comment 30(g)-1 clarifies that for transfers from an account, whether a consumer is located in a State depends on where the consumer's account is located. If the account is located in a State, the consumer will be located in a State for purposes of the definition of “sender” in § 1005.30(g), notwithstanding comment 3(a)-3. Where a transfer is requested electronically or by telephone and the transfer is not from an account, the provider may make the determination of whether a consumer is located in a State on information that is provided by the consumer and on any records associated with the consumer that it might have, such as an address provided by the consumer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>One commenter asked the Bureau to clarify the application of Regulation E's comment 3(a)-3 to subpart B. Comment 3(a)-3 addresses the foreign applicability of Regulation E with respect to EFTs. The proposed definition of “sender” and the proposed commentary did not address how comment 3(a)-3 would apply with respect to remittance transfers that are EFTs, such as international ACH transfers from an account. The statutory definition of “sender,” and thus the definition in § 1005.30(g), does not turn on a consumer's residency; rather, the definition only requires that there be a consumer in a State requesting a remittance transfer. As with the definition of “designated recipient,” the Bureau believes that directing providers to look to the location of the account as a proxy for the location of the sender will create a bright line that will facilitate compliance with the final rule and ease compliance burden. Thus, as discussed above, under the final rule, for remittance transfers from an account, providers must look to the location of the account to determine whether there is a sender, and not the residency of the consumer requesting the transfer. Accordingly, final comment 30(g)-1 clarifies that the provider should make its determination notwithstanding comment 3(a)-3.</analysisParagraph>

As discussed in more detail below, many commenters requested clarification on specific definitions, and also urged the Bureau to consider a number of revisions and exemptions to limit the application of the rule to different types of transactions. Final § 1005.30 incorporates the statutory definitions generally as proposed, with additional interpretations and clarifications in response to specific concerns raised by commenters. The final rule revises the definition of “business day” in § 1005.30(b) to more closely track the definition of “business day” in § 1005.2(d) of Regulation E. In addition, the final rule adds a new definition of “preauthorized remittance transfer.”</analysisParagraph>

            <title>30(c) Designated Recipient</title>
            <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(g)(1) provides that “designated recipient” means “any person located in a foreign country and identified by the sender as the authorized recipient of a remittance transfer to be made by a remittance transfer provider, except that a designated recipient shall not be deemed to be a consumer for purposes of [the EFTA].” Proposed § 205.30(c) implemented EFTA section 919(g)(1), with several edits for clarity. First, the Board proposal noted that a remittance transfer provider will generally only know the location where funds are to be sent, rather than where a designated recipient is physically located. For instance, although the sender may indicate that funds are to be sent to the recipient in Mexico City, the recipient could actually be in the United States at the time of the transfer. Thus, the Board stated that the statutory reference to a “person located in a foreign country” should be read with a view to the location where funds are to be sent. Additionally, the statute references a remittance transfer “to be made by a remittance transfer provider.” As discussed below, the definition of “remittance transfer” requires that it be sent by a remittance transfer provider, so this language is unnecessary. Accordingly, proposed § 205.30(c) stated that a designated recipient is any person specified by the sender as an authorized recipient of a remittance transfer to be received at a location in a foreign country. The final rule adopts the proposed rule as proposed in renumbered § 1005.30(c), but with additional explanatory commentary to address issues raised by commenters.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 30(c)-1 stated that a designated recipient can be either a natural person or a business. Several commenters argued that transfers to entities other than natural persons should be excluded, so that the rule would cover only consumer-to-consumer transfers. However, the statute clearly anticipates covering consumer-to-business transfers, as it defines “designated recipient” to include transfers to “persons,” and does not limit its application to consumer recipients. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 15 U.S.C. 1693p(g)(1). The EFTA defines “consumer” to mean a natural person, but does not define the term “person.” Nonetheless, the EFTA uses the term “person” in many provisions, and the context of how the term “person” is used in those EFTA provisions indicates that it includes entities that are natural persons, as well as organizations. For example, the EFTA defines the term “financial institution” to mean “a State or National bank, a State or Federal savings and loan association, a mutual savings bank, a State or Federal credit union, or any <em data-original="E-03">other</em> person who, directly or indirectly, holds an account belonging to a consumer.” (emphasis added). As a result, Regulation E has long defined “person” to mean a natural person or an organization. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.2(j). The Bureau believes that the statute by using the term “person” intended to cover remittance transfers sent by consumers not just to family members, but also directly to businesses abroad to pay tuition, mortgage, medical, utilities, or other bills or to fulfill other obligations. Accordingly, the final rule does not generally exclude consumer-to-business transfers where a remittance transfer provider is acting as an electronic intermediary. Instead, the Bureau is adopting comment 30(c)-1 to state that a designated recipient can be either a natural person or an organization, such as a corporation.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 30(c)-2 explained that a remittance transfer is received at a location in a foreign country if funds are to be received at a location physically outside of any State.<footnote ref="67">The term “State” is defined in 12 CFR 1005.2(l).</footnote>
              One money transmitter commenter noted that it may know the country to which a transfer is being sent, but not the specific payout location. The comment was intended to address the receipt of funds at a foreign location in the general sense; that is, any location that is outside of a State. Thus, the final comment, adopted as renumbered comment 30(c)-2.i., clarifies that a sender need not designate a specific pick-up location.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In addition, commenters requested further clarification for determining whether there is a designated recipient when a transfer is made to an account. For example, in a wire transfer transaction, commenters stated that the consumer requesting the transfer may only identify the recipient of funds by an account number or the location or routing number of the receiving institution. Other commenters argued that transfers to an account associated with an institution in a State should not be viewed as transfers to a designated recipient, even if a person in a foreign country has exclusive access to the account.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>New comment 30(c)-2.ii. provides further guidance to address these issues. For transfers to a designated recipient's account, comment 30(c)-2.ii. states that whether funds are to be received at a location physically outside of any State depends on where the account is located. If the account is located in a State, the funds will not be received at a location in a foreign country.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau concurs with the Board's statement that the statutory reference to a “person located in a foreign country” should be read with a view to the location where funds are to be sent, and believes that comment 30(c)-2.ii. is consistent with this approach. Thus, the Bureau agrees that transfers to domestic accounts should not be considered transfers to a location in a foreign country. The Bureau also agrees that providers may not always know where a recipient is physically located at the time a consumer requests a transfer to be sent, and believes that directing providers to look to the location of the account, rather than the location of the individual recipient, creates an appropriate bright line that will facilitate compliance with the final rule, ease compliance burden, and most effectively accomplish the purpose of the statute to apply the provisions to transfers to foreign countries.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>One commenter suggested revising the definition of “designated recipient” to exclude senders, such that transfers made by a sender to a sender's separate account abroad would be excluded. However, nothing in the statute indicates that the definition of “designated recipient” should exclude transfers to a foreign-based account of the sender. The Bureau believes that a sender would also benefit from disclosures indicating the ultimate amount to be received in a transfer, particularly where an exchange rate is applied. The final rule adopts comment 30(c)-3 to clarify that a sender may also be a designated recipient, such as where a sender requests that a provider send an electronic transfer of funds from the sender's checking account in a State to the sender's checking account located in a foreign country.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Board solicited comment on whether there could be instances where a remittance provider may receive a recipient's email address but no other information to determine the location where funds are to be received. Several commenters affirmed this could happen. For example, one commenter stated that consumers can provide a recipient's email address to use its transfer service; while recipients must register with the provider to access the transferred funds, it is possible that the provider would not know whether the transferred funds will be received at a location in a foreign country until the funds are claimed.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Final comment 30(c)-2.iii. addresses this scenario. Where the sender does not specify information about a recipient's account, but instead just provides information about the recipient, a remittance transfer provider must determine whether the funds will be received at a location in a foreign country based on information that is provided by the sender, and other information the provider may have, at the time the transfer is requested. For example, if a consumer gives a provider the recipient's email address, and the provider has no other information about whether the funds will be received by the recipient at a location in a foreign country, then the provider may determine that funds are not to be received at a location in a foreign country. However, if the provider has additional information at the time the transfer is requested indicating that funds are to be received in a foreign country, such as where the recipient's email address is registered with the provider and associated with a foreign account, then the provider has sufficient information to conclude that the remittance transfer is to be received at a location in a foreign country.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Commenters also noted that, with regard to prepaid cards, the provider may not know at the time the prepaid card is purchased whether the funds will be received at a location physically outside of any State. These commenters stated that where general-purpose reloadable prepaid cards or payroll cards are issued to two persons—one person in a State and another person in a foreign country—and both cards access the same funds, the provider may not be able to ascertain at the time of the request for the cards that funds will be received at a location physically outside of any State. In this case, the issuer does not know at the time of the request the ultimate recipient of the funds.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that funds that can be accessed by a prepaid card are generally not considered to be an “account” as defined in § 1005.2(b) of Regulation E. Thus, where the funds that can be accessed by a prepaid card are held does not determine whether a prepaid card is being issued to a designated recipient. The Bureau believes when a participant in a prepaid card program, such as a prepaid card issuer or a prepaid card program manager, issues prepaid cards, the participant in the prepaid card program must look to where it or another participant in the prepaid card program sends the prepaid cards, to determine whether the prepaid card funds will be received in a foreign country. Likewise, when a participant in a prepaid card program adds additional funds at the sender's direct request to prepaid cards that it or any other participant previously issued, the participant in the prepaid card program must look to where it or another participant in the prepaid card program has sent the cards to determine whether the prepaid card funds will be received in a foreign country. The Bureau does not believe that it is appropriate for a participant in the prepaid card program to determine whether the funds will be received in a foreign country based on where the participants have decided to hold the funds the cards access. The Bureau believes that such a rule would allow participants in the prepaid card program to circumvent the remittance transfer rules by holding the funds in a State. Under such an approach, participants in the prepaid card program would not be required to comply with the remittance transfer rules if the funds are located in a State even where prepaid cards that access the funds are sent only to recipients located in a foreign country.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In the case where two prepaid cards are issued to two persons—one person in a State and another person in a foreign country—and both cards access the same funds, the Bureau believes that the provider has sufficient information to determine that the funds will be received in a foreign country because it has sent one of the prepaid cards to a person in a foreign country. Proposed comment 30(d)-3 suggested that in this situation, the transfer would not be to a designated recipient because the sender retained the ability to draw down the funds on the prepaid card. Proposed comment 30(d)-3 is not adopted. The Bureau is concerned that if it adopted a rule that the transfer is not to a designated recipient in this case, a provider that sends prepaid cards abroad with the intent of providing a service where funds loaded in a State are intended to be accessed in a foreign country could circumvent the remittance transfer rules by always automatically providing a second prepaid card to the sender, even if the sender did not request a second card.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Thus, final comment 30(c)-2.iii. clarifies that if a consumer in a State purchases a prepaid card, the provider has sufficient information to conclude that the funds are to be received in a foreign country if the remittance transfer provider sends a prepaid card to a specified recipient in a foreign country, even if a person located in a State, including the sender, retains the ability to access funds on the prepaid card. In this case, the prepaid issuer knows at the time of the request that a prepaid card has been sent to a recipient located in a foreign country. In contrast, if the provider provides the card directly to the consumer, the provider may conclude that funds are not to be received in a foreign country, because the provider does not know whether the consumer will subsequently send the prepaid card to a recipient in a foreign country.</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisParagraph>Under the 2012 Final Rule, the term “designated recipient” is defined to mean any person specified by the sender as the authorized recipient of a remittance transfer to be received at a location in a foreign country.

Comment 30(c)-1 further clarifies that a designated recipient can be either a natural person or an organization, such as a corporation. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.2(j) (definition of person).  Relatedly, § 1005.31(b)(2)(iii) requires a remittance transfer provider to disclose to a sender the name of the designated recipient.

            <analysisParagraph>As discussed below in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv), the Bureau is adopting certain revisions to 2012 Final Rule's error resolution provisions in § 1005.33 where a transfer is delivered to someone other than the designated recipient.  In particular, § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) creates a new exception to the definition of error in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) that applies when a sender provides an incorrect account number or recipient institution identifier, and the conditions in § 1005.33(h) are met.  Based on comments received regarding these proposed changes, and, in particular, concerning the specific mistakes by a sender that might result in an error under the 2012 Final Rule, the Bureau believes that it would be useful to provide further clarity on how the designated recipient is determined for purposes of determining whether an error has occurred or the new exception under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) applies.  In particular, the Bureau believes it necessary to address situations in which the transfer is delivered to someone other than the designated recipient named by the sender at the time of the transfer.

            <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed § 205.33(c) to implement the statutory time frame for investigating errors and set forth the procedures for resolving an error, including the applicable remedies. The Bureau is adopting proposed § 205.33(c) in renumbered § 1005.33(c) with the changes discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisSection>
              <title>33(c)(1) Time Limits for Investigation and Report to Consumer of Error</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Consistent with EFTA section 919(d)(1)(B), proposed § 205.33(c)(1) provided that a remittance transfer provider must promptly investigate a notice of error to determine whether an error occurred within 90 days of receiving the sender's notice. Some industry commenters suggested that the time to investigate a notice of error should be extended. One industry trade association commenter stated that for one of its member banks, while international wire “exceptions” (including non-timely delivery) averaged less than 1% of its international wire transfers, more than 15% of these exceptions took longer than 90 days to resolve.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that the 90-day time period is set by the statute. Furthermore, compared to the time period to resolve errors for EFTs (including those a consumer may have initiated abroad), which can be either 10 business days or 45 calendar days, 90 days is twice the length of the longest allowable time period. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.11(c). Although a longer period than the one available for EFTs may be justified given the international nature of these transactions, the Bureau believes that senders should have errors resolved in a timely manner. Consequently, the Bureau does not believe use of its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to extend the statutorily-imposed 90-day period is warranted.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>To effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Board also proposed to include in proposed § 205.33(c)(1) a requirement that the remittance transfer provider report the results to the sender within three business days after completing its investigation. As the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, this timing is consistent with the time frame for reporting the results of an error investigation under Regulation E, § 1005.11(c)(2)(iv). In addition, under proposed § 205.33(c)(1), the report or notice of results would have to alert the sender of any remedies available for correcting any error that the provider determines has occurred.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(d)(1) does not expressly require a notice to be provided to the sender when the provider determines that an error has occurred. However, the Board proposed to require that a notice be given in these circumstances to alert the sender of the results of the investigation, as well as to inform the sender of available remedies. In proposing this requirement, the Board did not propose that the notice to a sender that an error occurred as asserted had to be in writing because such a requirement could unnecessarily delay a sender's ability to receive an appropriate remedy. Accordingly, the Board proposed comment 33(c)-1 to clarify that if the error occurred as described by the sender, the provider may inform the sender of its findings either orally or in writing. If the error did not occur as described, however, the remittance transfer provider would have to provide a written notice of its findings under § 1005.33(d), as discussed below. The Bureau agrees with the Board's reasoning in proposing both § 205.33(c)(1) and comment 33(c)-1. Accordingly, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to adopt these provisions substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(c)(1) and comment 33(c)-1, respectively.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters also requested that the Bureau specify that the burden of proof should be on the remittance transfer provider so that if a sender presents evidence that there has been an error, the burden should unequivocally shift to the remittance transfer provider to show that there was not an error. The Bureau notes that the EFTA establishes various burdens of proof. For example, under EFTA section 909(b), in any action involving a consumer's liability for an unauthorized EFT, the burden of proof is upon the financial institution to show that the EFT was authorized. However, under EFTA section 910(b), a financial institution is not liable for an incorrect or delayed EFT if it can show by a preponderance of the evidence that its action or failure to act resulted from an act of God or other circumstance beyond its control or a technical malfunction known to the consumer at the time the consumer attempted to initiate the EFT. Section 1073 of the Dodd-Frank Act did not amend the EFTA to adopt a specific burden of proof for errors related to remittance transfers that are not EFTs. Therefore, the Bureau does not believe it is appropriate to address this issue.</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisSection>
              <title>33(c)(2) Remedies</title>
              <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed § 205.33(c)(2) to establish the procedures and remedies for correcting an error. Proposed § 205.33(c)(2)(i) and (ii) included the two remedies that are specified in EFTA section 919(d)(1)(B). Under proposed § 205.33(c)(2), the sender may designate the preferred remedy in the event of an error, consistent with EFTA section 919(d)(1)(B). Thus, under proposed § 205.33(c)(2)(i), the sender could choose to obtain a refund of the amount tendered in connection with the remittance transfer that was not properly transmitted, or an amount appropriate to resolve the error. Alternatively, under proposed § 205.33(c)(2)(ii), the sender could choose to have the remittance transfer provider send to the designated recipient the amount appropriate to resolve the error, at no additional cost to the sender or the designated recipient. The Bureau did not receive any comments objecting to these remedies. Therefore, the statutory remedies set forth in proposed § 205.33(c)(2)(i) and (ii) are adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(c)(2)(i)(A) and (B), respectively, for errors under § 1005.33(a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(iii), and § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) and (<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), respectively, for an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv). Thus, the final rule clarifies that these remedies do not apply to a sender's request for documentation or for additional information or clarification under § 1005.33(a)(1)(v), where the appropriate remedy is the requested documentation, information, or clarification. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) as discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>However, as discussed above with respect to proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(B), the Bureau believes that if the failure to make funds from a remittance transfer available on the disclosed date of availability is caused by the sender providing incorrect information in connection with the remittance transfer to the provider, the sender's mistake should not obligate a remittance transfer provider to bear all the costs for resending the remittance transfer. As noted above, many industry commenters objected to the requirement that the remittance transfer provider absorb the costs of amending and resending a transfer when the sender is at fault because doing so would require the remittance transfer provider and other senders, through higher fees, to bear the responsibility for a sender's mistake.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Therefore, § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) does not require that providers send to the designated recipient the amount appropriate to resolve the error at no additional cost to the sender or the designated recipient if the sender provided incorrect information in connection with the remittance transfer to the provider. Instead, § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) provides that if the sender provided incorrect information to the remittance transfer provider in connection with the remittance transfer, third party fees may be imposed for resending the remittance transfer with the corrected information. Section 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) permits third party fees and taxes that were actually incurred in the earlier transmission attempt to be imposed for the resend, but does not permit remittance transfer providers to charge senders a second time for the provider's own fees.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is making this distinction in order to apply the rule without requiring complicated individualized analyses and allocations of the expenses actually incurred in connection with a failed transaction. The Bureau believes this approach strikes a more appropriate balance between the interests of providers and senders than the proposed rule of not permitting any fees to be imposed for the resend, given that third party fees and taxes are not controlled by the provider and are simply being passed on from other actors. Furthermore, the Bureau believes that affiliates of remittance transfer providers, like providers themselves, should not assess fees for resending a remittance transfer with corrected information.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also believes that if a sender provides insufficient information to enable the remittance transfer provider to complete the transfer as requested, third party fees should be permitted to be imposed for resending the remittance transfer with the additional information. For example, a sender may only provide a partial name for the designated recipient such that the entity distributing the funds cannot determine whether the person picking up the funds or the name associated with the account is the intended designated recipient. Therefore, § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) provides that if the sender provided insufficient information to the remittance transfer provider in connection with the remittance transfer, third party fees may be imposed for resending the remittance transfer with the additional information.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adopting a new comment 33(c)-2 to clarify § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>). The comment generally incorporates proposed comment 33(a)-6 to clarify that if the failure to make funds from a transfer available by the disclosed date of availability occurred due to the provider's miscommunication of information necessary for the designated recipient to pick up the transfer, such as providing the incorrect location where the transfer may be picked up or providing the wrong confirmation number or code for the transfer, such failure would not be treated as a failure caused by the sender providing incorrect or insufficient information in connection with the remittance transfer to the provider. The comment also clarifies that while third party fees may be imposed for resending the remittance transfer with the corrected or additional information, the remittance transfer provider may not require the sender to provide the principal transfer amount again.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, if funds were not exchanged in the first unsuccessful attempt of the remittance transfer, the provider must use the exchange rate it is using for such transfers on the date of the resend. The Bureau recognizes that this approach is different from the approach adopted for other errors, where the provider must apply the exchange rate stated in the receipt or combined disclosure. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 33(c)-3, discussed below. For errors where the failure was not caused by the sender providing incorrect or insufficient information, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate for the remedy to reflect what was promised to the sender. In contrast, when the failure is caused by the sender providing incorrect or insufficient information, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to generally put the provider and the sender in the same position as if the first unsuccessful attempt of the remittance transfer had never occurred.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>For example, if a sender instructs a remittance transfer provider to send US$100 to a designated recipient in a foreign country in local currency, for which the remittance transfer provider charges a transfer fee of US$10, and the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information that resulted in non-delivery of the remittance transfer, the remittance transfer provider may not require the sender to provide another US$100 to the remittance transfer provider to send or charge the sender another US$10 transfer fee. If the funds were not exchanged in the first unsuccessful attempt of the remittance transfer, the provider must use the exchange rate it is using for such transfers on the date of the resend.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Based on this rule, if a remittance transfer is deposited in an account that does not belong to the designated recipient named in the receipt because the sender provided the wrong account number for the designated recipient, the provider may charge the sender for resending the remittance transfer, but may not have the sender provide the principal transfer amount again in the event that the remittance transfer provider is unable to have the funds extracted from the wrong account. The Bureau believes that this approach will encourage providers and other parties involved in the remittance transfer to develop security procedures to limit the risk of funds being deposited in an account when the name of the designated recipient named in the receipt does not match the name associated with the account number. The Bureau notes that remittance transfer providers will be supplied with both the name, and if provided by the sender, the telephone number and/or address of the designated recipient, which the provider must disclose on the receipt under § 1005.31(b)(2)(iii).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>New comment 33(c)-2 clarifies that although third party fees may be imposed on the sender for resending the remittance transfer with the corrected or additional information, third party fees that were not incurred during the first unsuccessful remittance transfer attempt may not be imposed again for resending the remittance transfer. For example, suppose a sender instructed the remittance transfer provider to send US$100 to a designated recipient in a foreign country, for which a remittance transfer provider charges a transfer fee of US$10 and an intermediary institution charges a lifting fee of US$5, such that the designated recipient is expected to receive only US$95, as indicated in the receipt. If the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information that resulted in non-delivery of the remittance transfer and the US$5 lifting fee was incurred in the first attempt, the sender may choose to provide an additional amount to offset the US$5 lifting fee deducted in the first unsuccessful remittance transfer attempt and ensure that the designated recipient receives US$95 or may choose to resend the US$95 amount with the understanding that another fee may be deducted by the intermediary institution, as indicated in the receipt. Otherwise, if the US$5 lifting fee was not incurred in the first attempt, then the remittance transfer provider must send the original US$100 for the resend, and the sender may expect a US$5 lifting fee to be imposed by the intermediary institution, as indicated in the receipt. Comment 33(c)-2 also reminds providers that a request to resend a remittance transfer is a request to send a remittance transfer. Therefore, a provider must provide the disclosures required by § 1005.31 for a resend of a remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Board proposed to add a separate, cumulative remedy that would apply if the transfer was not made available to the designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv). This additional remedy was proposed pursuant to the Board's authority under EFTA section 919(d)(1)(B) to provide “such other remedy” as the Board determines appropriate “for the protection of senders.” Under proposed § 205.33(c)(2)(iii), if the remittance transfer was not sent or delivered to the designated recipient by the stated date of availability, the remittance transfer provider would be required to refund all fees charged or imposed in connection with the transfer, even if the consumer asks the provider to send the remittance transfer to the designated recipient as the preferred remedy. If the funds have already been delivered to the recipient, however, even if on an untimely basis, the sole remedy in such case would be the refund of fees.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters objected to the remedy to refund all fees associated with the remittance transfer. As the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, requiring the provider to refund all fees imposed in connection with the remittance transfer, including the transfer fee, is appropriate under such circumstances because the sender did not receive the contracted service, specifically the availability of funds in connection with the transfer by the disclosed date. Furthermore, the Board noted that in some cases, the sender may have paid an additional fee for expedited delivery of funds.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Based on some industry comments, the Bureau believes there may be some confusion regarding when the proposed remedy of refunding fees associated with the remittance transfer may be available. As stated in proposed § 205(c)(2)(iii), the remedy is only available in the case of an error asserted under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv) (adopted as § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) above). Accordingly, if the remittance transfer provider finds that the error that occurred is, for example, an incorrect amount paid by a sender in connection with a remittance transfer under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(i) (adopted as § 1005.33(a)(1)(i) above), the provider would be under no obligation to refund the fees associated with the remittance transfer to a sender. Instead, the only remedies required to be available to a sender would be a refund of the amount appropriate to resolve the error under proposed § 205(c)(2)(i) (adopted as § 1005(c)(2)(i)(A) above) or to have the amount appropriate to resolve the error sent to the designated recipient, at no additional cost to the sender or the designated recipient under proposed § 205.33(c)(2)(ii) (adopted as § 1005(c)(2)(i)(B) above).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with the Board that the remedy of refunding all fees imposed for the remittance transfer is appropriate if the remittance transfer was not made available to the designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, the Bureau believes that taxes should also be refunded. One industry commenter noted that for certain jurisdictions, the remittance transfer provider may be prohibited by law from refunding taxes. Therefore, the Bureau adopts proposed § 205.33(c)(2)(iii) in renumbered § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B) with the additional requirement to refund taxes to the extent not prohibited by law.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Moreover, consistent with § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), which provides that third party fees may be imposed for resending the remittance transfer if the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information to the remittance transfer provider in connection with the remittance transfer, § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B) provides that the provider need not refund fees imposed for the remittance transfer if the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information to the remittance transfer provider in connection with the remittance transfer. The Bureau is also adopting new § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) to clarify that in the case of an error asserted under § 1005.33(a)(1)(v), which is a request for documentation, additional information or clarification concerning a remittance transfer, the appropriate remedy is providing the requested documentation, information, or clarification.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(c)(2) also provided that the remittance transfer provider must correct the error within one business day of, or as soon as reasonably practicable after, receiving the sender's instructions regarding the appropriate remedy. The Board explained that the proposed rule would provide additional flexibility to address the limited circumstances where the particular method of sending a remittance transfer may present practical impediments to a provider's ability to correct an error within one business day. For example, it may not be practicable for a wire transfer that goes through several intermediary institutions before reaching the designated recipient to make the amount in error available to the recipient within one business day in accordance with a sender's request. The Bureau agrees with the Board's rationale in requiring the remittance transfer provider to correct the error within one business day of, or as soon as reasonably practicable after, receiving the sender's instructions regarding the appropriate remedy. The Bureau retains this aspect of proposed § 205.33(c)(2) in renumbered § 1005.33(c)(2) and also includes other clarifying, non-substantive changes.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 33(c)-2 clarified that the remittance transfer provider may request that the sender designate the preferred remedy at the time the sender provides notice of error. As the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, permitting such requests may enable providers to process error claims more expeditiously without waiting for the sender's subsequent instructions after notifying the sender of the results of the investigation. If the sender does not indicate the desired remedy at the time of providing notice of error, the proposed comment provided that the remittance transfer provider must notify the sender of any available remedies in the report provided under proposed § 205.33(c)(1) (adopted as § 1005(c)(1) above) after determining an error occurred. Proposed comment 33(c)-2 is adopted as comment 33(c)-3.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>However, the Board recognized in the May 2011 Proposed Rule that by giving the sender the ability to choose the remedy, the statute, and thus the rule, may make it impossible for a remittance transfer provider to promptly correct an error if the consumer fails to designate an appropriate remedy either at the time of providing the notice of error or in response to the provider's notice informing the consumer of its error determination and available remedies. The Board therefore requested comment on whether remittance transfer providers should be permitted to select a default method of correcting errors.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Both industry and consumer group commenters agreed that there should be a default method of correcting errors. Industry commenters suggested that the remittance transfer provider should be permitted to select the default remedy. Consumer group commenters, however, recommended that the Bureau should set the default remedy of refunding to the sender the appropriate amount.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Based on the comments received, the Bureau adopts a new comment 33(c)-4 to permit a remittance transfer provider to select a default remedy that the provider will use if the sender does not designate a remedy within a reasonable time after the sender receives the report provided under § 1005.33(c)(1). The Bureau believes that providing for a default remedy after a sender has had a reasonable opportunity to choose a remedy would balance the statute's aim to provide a sender the chance to choose his or her preferred remedy with the goal of promptly resolving the sender's outstanding error claim. Furthermore, allowing remittance transfer providers to select the default remedy reduces burden on providers without consumer harm because providers have the ability to provide a preferred remedy without compromising a sender's opportunity to choose.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In addition, new comment 33(c)-4 provides a safe harbor for the amount of time that would be considered reasonable after the report under § 1005.33(c)(1) is provided. Specifically, comment 33(c)-4 states that a provider that permits a sender to designate a remedy within 10 days after the provider has sent the report provided under § 1005.33(c)(1) before selecting the default remedy is deemed to have provided the sender with a reasonable time to designate a remedy. In selecting the 10-day time frame as a safe harbor, the Bureau notes the existence of a similar provision under Regulation Z. Under the commentary to 12 CFR 1026.5(b)(1)(i), a creditor that provides an account-opening disclosure in connection with a balance transfer may effectuate the balance transfer if the consumer has not withdrawn the balance transfer request within 10 days after the creditor has sent the account-opening disclosure. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 5(b)(1)(i)-5 under Regulation Z. New comment 33(c)-4 also clarifies that in the case a default remedy is provided, the remittance transfer provider must correct the error within one business day, or as soon as reasonably practicable, after the reasonable time for the sender to designate the remedy has passed.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters also suggested that the Bureau adopt guidance on how to handle cases where a sender cannot be contacted after an error is discovered by the provider, sender, or recipient. These commenters recommended that three phone calls or emails should constitute a good faith effort to contact the sender. The Bureau notes that the error resolution procedures only apply if the sender asserts an error. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 33(b)-1 adopted above. A notice of error from a sender must contain information to enable the provider to identify the sender's name and telephone number or address. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(b)(1)(ii)(A) adopted above. Therefore, the Bureau believes that remittance transfer providers will have valid contact information from the sender when the sender asserts the error and that remittance transfer providers will make a reasonable effort to contact senders to fulfill their error resolution requirements.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters requested that the final rule clarify the meaning of “amount appropriate to resolve the error.” The Bureau agrees that clarification of this term would be helpful. New comment 33(c)-5 provides that for the purposes of the remedies set forth in § 1005.33(c)(2)(i)(A), (c)(2)(i)(B), (c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>), and (c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), the amount appropriate to resolve the error is the specific amount of transferred funds that should have been received if the remittance transfer had been effected without error. New comment 33(c)-5 further clarifies that the amount appropriate to resolve the error does not include consequential damages.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters requested further guidance on the form a refund may take. In particular, commenters were concerned that remittance transfer providers not be permitted to provide store credit in the refund amount. The Bureau agrees that the form of any refund provided under § 1005.33(c)(2)(i)(A) should generally be the same as the form of payment for the remittance transfer. The Bureau also believes that a provider should also be permitted to provide a refund in cash. Therefore, the Bureau adopts new comment 33(c)-6 to clarify that a remittance transfer provider may, at its discretion, issue a refund either in cash or in the same form of payment that was initially provided by the sender for the remittance transfer. The comment is similar to comment 34(b)-1, discussed below, regarding the form of refund after a cancellation.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is, however, amending comment 34(b)-1 in one respect, which is also reflected in new comment 33(c)-6. Specifically, the Bureau recognizes that if a sender provided cash to the remittance transfer provider for the remittance transfer, there may be instances when a cash refund may not be possible or convenient to the sender. Generally, it is undesirable for a provider to mail cash, and agents may be prohibited from providing cash to consumers. Even if agents were permitted to provide cash refunds, it may be inconvenient to the sender to return to the remittance transfer provider or agent location to pick up the cash refund. Consequently, comments 33(c)-6 and 34(b)-1 state that a provider may issue a refund by check if a sender initially provided cash for the remittance transfer. For example, if the sender originally provided cash as payment for the transfer, the provider may mail a check to the sender in the amount of the payment.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters also suggested that the Bureau consider emphasizing that remittance transfer providers should comply with applicable State escheat laws if the sender cannot be contacted to receive a refund. The Bureau believes that such clarification is unnecessary. Furthermore, the Bureau is concerned that an explicit reference to State escheat laws in this instance may imply that other State laws (for example, State disclosure requirements for money transmitters) do not apply. Consequently, the Bureau declines to adopt this suggestion.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 33(c)-3 provided additional guidance regarding the appropriate remedies where the sender has paid an excess amount to send a remittance transfer. Under that circumstance, the sender may request a refund of the amount paid in excess or may request that the remittance transfer provider make that excess amount available to the designated recipient at no additional cost. The Bureau did not receive any comments on the proposed comment. The Bureau adopts proposed comment 33(c)-3 substantially as proposed in comment 33(c)-7.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Under proposed comment 33(c)-4, fees that must be refunded to a sender for a failure to make funds from a remittance transfer available by the stated date of availability under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) include all fees imposed for the transfer, regardless of the party that imposed the fee, and are not limited to fees imposed by the provider. Some industry commenters objected to having to refund fees not imposed by the remittance transfer provider. As explained above, however, the Bureau believes that refunding all fees is appropriate if the remittance transfer service was not provided as contracted because the funds were not made available by the disclosed date of availability.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is revising proposed comment 33(c)-4, however, to respond to a request from a Federal Reserve Bank commenter to resolve ambiguities in the relationship between the remedies in § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) and (<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) and the remedy in § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B). Specifically, the Bureau has revised proposed comment 33(c)-4, renumbered as comment 33(c)-8, to clarify that the remittance transfer provider must correct the error in accordance with § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A), as applicable. Therefore, if the remittance transfer was made available to the designated recipient, but on an untimely basis, the remedies under § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A) would not be applicable. In that circumstance, the “amount appropriate to resolve the error” would be zero since the entire transfer amount was made available to the designated recipient. The sender's only remedy in this case would be the refund of fees under § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B). If, however, the funds were never made available to the designated recipient, then the sender would have one of the remedies available under § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) or (<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) in addition to the remedy of the fee refund under § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B). The Bureau also believes the renumbering in § 1005.33(c)(2) should make this clear.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 33(c)-5 clarified that if an error occurred, whether as alleged or in a different amount or manner, a remittance transfer provider may not impose any charges related to any aspect of the error resolution process, including any charges for documentation or investigation. As discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the Board expressed concern that such fees or charges might have a chilling effect on a sender's good faith assertion of errors and noted that the proposed comment is similar to comment 11(c)-3 for EFTs. Proposed 33(c)-5, however, also stated that nothing would prohibit a remittance transfer provider from imposing a fee for making copies of documentation for non-error-resolution-related purposes, such as for tax documentation purposes under § 1005.33(a)(2)(iii). The Bureau did not receive any comments on the proposed comment. Therefore, the Bureau adopts proposed comment 33(c)-5 as proposed in comment 33(c)-9.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Finally, under proposed comment 33(c)-6, a remittance transfer provider may correct an error, without further investigation, in the amount or manner alleged by the sender to be in error. This is similar to comment 11(c)-4 for EFTs. As with comment 11(c)-4, the provider must otherwise comply with all other applicable requirements of the error resolution procedures, including providing notice of the resolution of the error. Commenters did not address this proposed comment. Therefore, the Bureau adopts proposed comment 33(c)-6 substantially as proposed in comment 33(c)-10.</analysisParagraph>

Comment 33(a)-5 to the 2012 Final Rule elaborates on the definition of the term “error” under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) and explains that such errors under subpart B of Regulation E include, among other things, the late delivery of funds, the total non-delivery of a remittance transfer, and the delivery of funds to the wrong account. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comments 33(a)-5.1 and .ii.  The commentary further notes that if only a portion of the funds are made available by the disclosed date of availability, then § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) does not apply, but § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) may apply instead.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>As explained under comment 33(c)-2 in the 2012 Final Rule, an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) would include situations where a remittance transfer provider failed to make funds in connection with a remittance transfer available to a designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability because the sender provided an incorrect account number to the remittance transfer provider.  After issuance of the 2012 Final Rule, the Bureau received comments from industry that providers often have no means to verify designated recipients' account numbers for remittance transfers into foreign bank accounts.  As a result, providers could have to bear the potentially significant costs of their customers' mistakes in cases in which funds were deposited in the wrong account and could not be recovered as a result of the sender's provision of an incorrect account number.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>In the December Proposal, the Bureau proposed to revise the definition of error in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) by adding a fourth, conditional exception.  Proposed § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) would have excluded from the definition of error a failure to make funds available to the designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability, where such failure resulted from the sender having given the remittance transfer provider an incorrect account number, provided that the provider met the conditions set forth in proposed § 1005.33(h).  These proposed conditions, would have required providers to notify senders of the risk that their funds could be lost, to investigate reported errors, and to attempt to recover the missing funds.  In addition, the exception would have been limited to situations in which the funds were actually deposited into the wrong account.  Where these conditions were met, the proposed exception would not have required providers to bear the cost of refunding or resending transfers.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau sought comment on the proposed exception generally and whether it should be limited to mistakes regarding account numbers or expanded to include other incorrect information provided by senders in connection with remittance transfers, such as routing numbers.  Each of these is discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisSection>
                    <title>Exception for Senders' Mistakes Regarding Account Numbers</title>
                    <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters uniformly supported the addition of the proposed exception to the definition of error where the error was caused by the sender's provision of an incorrect account number.  They put forth a number of reasons why they favored the proposed change.  In many respects, these comments expanded upon those received prior to the December Proposal.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters reiterated earlier concerns about the large potential exposure given their general inability of remittance transfer providers to validate the accuracy of a designated recipient's account number provided in connection with a wire transfers and similar types of open network transfers sent to accounts at banks and other institutions abroad.  These commenters argued that providers sending these transfers over open networks generally have limited ability to cross-check account numbers with the names of accountholders prior to sending transfers because they often have no direct relationships with recipient institutions and thus no means of accessing those institutions' account information.  Commenters further stated that as a result, the only way for a provider to validate such numbers may be to contact the recipient institution manually, which may be time-consuming and difficult due to language and time zone issues.  Such validation would necessitate manual handling of remittance transfers and limit the ability of providers to use automated systems, which are less costly than manual handling of each transfer.  Commenters stated their concern that manual validation could substantially increase costs to senders and delay the processing of remittance transfers.  Relatedly, several commenters claimed that it was infeasible to expect providers to develop account number verification systems, automated or otherwise, before the effective date of the 2012 Final Rule (which was scheduled to take effect on February 7, 2013) due to the number of institutions worldwide that would need to adjust their systems used for transmitting wires.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters also reiterated concerns expressed prior to the issuance of the December Proposal regarding the potential for fraud if a sender's provision of an incorrect account number is considered an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv).  As discussed in the December Proposal, commenters had stated that the 2012 Final Rule could enable fraudulent activity to flourish because, if unscrupulous senders provided incorrect account numbers and funds were sent to a coconspirator, remittance transfer providers might have to send transfer amounts again to another coconspirator without first recovering them.  Commenters argued that the fraud exception in the 2012 Final Rule—§ 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C)—is insufficient because for providers to use the exception would be difficult in most circumstances.  Many industry commenters stated that providers in the United States typically have a limited ability to gather evidence of fraud from a recipient institution abroad or to mandate cooperation from foreign institutions with whom they have no direct relationship.  Industry commenters also noted that even if a provider suspected fraud, the lack of evidence would cause providers to hesitate to accuse one of its own customers of fraud.  Industry commenters also stated that the 2012 Final Rule departed from current industry practice by requiring that remittance transfer providers resend or refund a remittance transfer even when a sender's mistake results in mis-delivery of funds that cannot be recovered.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters expressed concern that in light of the significant exposure under the 2012 Final Rule's sender error provisions, if the Bureau did not revise the error resolution procedures as it proposed to do in the December Proposal, many remittance transfer providers would curtail their remittance transfer offerings such as by limiting the amount permitted per transfer, limiting transfers to certain trusted customers, or by exiting the remittance transfer business altogether.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters also argued that the Bureau should not have adopted the approach taken in the 2012 Final Rule to sender error because it was not mandated by statute.  One of these commenters opined that because the Dodd-Frank Act was not specific with respect to who must bear the cost of a mis-directed remittance transfer, the Bureau's legal authority to require remittance transfer providers to bear the cost of mistakes made by senders was questionable.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>In contrast to comments from industry, consumer group commenters were divided on whether the Bureau should adopt the proposed exception for certain sender errors.  Two consumer groups supported the proposed change because, they contended, the proposed rule achieved the appropriate allocation of risk between senders and remittance transfer providers and incentivized providers to minimize the occurrence of errors.  These commenters also stated that it would be difficult for providers, particularly small providers, to retrieve funds sent to the wrong account.  They further asserted that it would be difficult for providers, and particularly credit unions, to accuse their customers or members of fraud in order to avail themselves of the fraud exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C).  As a result, these consumer group commenters argued that absent the proposed revision, many providers might choose to exit the remittance transfer business altogether, resulting in a loss of access to senders.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Other consumer groups opposed the proposed changes and urged the Bureau not to amend the 2012 Final Rule with respect to sender mistakes regarding account numbers that result in the loss of the transfer amount.  First, some of these groups argued that the Bureau would be undermining the intent of Congress, which, they argued, was to motivate industry to change existing practices to develop more secure means of sending remittance transfers.  By adopting the proposed exception, these commenters argued, the Bureau would eliminate any incentive for remittance transfer providers to develop enhanced security procedures.  Relatedly, some consumer groups also argued that the existing definition of error in subpart A of Regulation E, specifically § 1005.11(a)(ii), already addresses the situation in which a consumer provides an incorrect recipient account number by creating an error for “incorrect” electronic fund transfers.<footnote ref="8">Section 1005.11 of subpart A of Regulation E contains error resolution provisions for electronic fund transfers.  Section 1005.11(a)(ii) states that a potential error under the rule is an “incorrect electronic fund transfer to or from the consumer's account.”</footnote>
                      These commenters noted that insofar as § 1005.11(a)(ii) is phrased in general terms and refers to an “incorrect electronic fund transfer” by its plain language it does not exclude incorrect information provided by a consumer (or any other party).  Insofar as § 1005.11(a)(ii) has long applied to a portion of remittance transfers, the commenters contended that had Congress intended to deny the protections of this provision to consumers, it would have done so more explicitly.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Finally, some consumer group commenters suggested that the Bureau should not adopt the proposed exception to the definition of error, even if the 2012 Final Rule would result in some remittance transfer providers exiting the market because they are unable to implement adequate verification procedures today.  Alternatively, these commenters suggested that, in order to reduce the risk of market exit, that the Bureau could adopt the proposed revisions, but limit the proposed exception to the definition of error to transfers over a certain dollar amount so that senders of smaller transfers would still benefit from the error provisions in the 2012 Final Rule.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Upon consideration of these comments and further consideration and to facilitate compliance, the Bureau is finalizing § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) with several changes from the proposed provision, which are discussed below.  As in the December Proposal, the exception as finalized will only apply if a remittance transfer provider can meet certain conditions including warnings to senders and use of reasonable validation methods where available.  These conditions are set forth in § 1005.33(h) and also are discussed in detail below.  Where the exception applies, providers will not be required to bear the cost of refunding or resending transfers if funds ultimately cannot be recovered.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>As it noted in the December Proposal, the Bureau believes that this exception appropriately allocates risk based on remittance transfer providers' existing methods for sending transfers, which often do not allow for or facilitate verification of designated recipients' account numbers.  The Bureau continues to believe it is important for industry to develop improved security procedures and expects to engage in a dialogue with industry about how to encourage the growth of improved controls and communication mechanisms.  But the Bureau understands that industry is unlikely to be reasonably able to implement such changes in the near future.  Subpart B of Regulation E does not regulate most recipient institutions, and the Bureau has concluded that individual providers, and particularly those sending transfers through open networks have limited ability to influence the practices of financial institutions worldwide in the short term.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Absent such changes, the Bureau is concerned that remittance transfer providers will exit the market or reduce remittance offerings rather than risk having to bear the cost of the entire transfer amount where funds are deposited into the wrong  account due to the sender's provision of an incorrect account number.  The Bureau believes such an interim disruption would not be in consumers' best interests, and thus has finalized the proposed exception as discussed below.  The Bureau, however, will continue to evaluate the development of procedures as it monitors providers' implementation of and compliance with the 2013 Final Rule.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>The Bureau disagrees with those consumer group commenters that the 2012 Final Rule should be allowed to take effect absent the proposed exception for sender account number mistakes, and that the Bureau should instead monitor whether the concerns summarized in the December Proposal—such as increased fraud and remittance transfer providers exiting the market—actually materialize.  As stated above and in the December Proposal, the Bureau is concerned that absent the proposed change, some providers would severely curtail their offerings or withdraw from the remittance transfer business altogether, and such a market change could have a negative impact on senders.  The Bureau also does not believe, as commenters suggested, that it is appropriate to limit the scope of the exception to larger value transfers, because doing so could potentially encourage providers to limit senders' access to smaller value transfers.  In addition, the Bureau does not believe it appropriate to engage in line drawing or to provide differential protections in this circumstance.  Furthermore, the Bureau disagrees that the proposed exception would harm senders in that the exception in many ways maintains the status quo insofar as the Bureau believes that, today, senders typically bear the loss when their mistake leads to a mis-deposit.  Nor does the Bureau believe that the problem of senders losing the transfer amount is particularly widespread today; insofar as the status quo is maintained, the Bureau does not expect this to change.  The Bureau's outreach confirmed that in most cases where there is a problem in the transmission of a remittance transfer, the provider is able to retrieve the funds or have them routed properly.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>With regard to commenters' arguments about the Bureau's statutory authority, the Bureau disagrees both with industry participant and consumer group arguments that the EFTA or section 1073 of the Dodd-Frank Act specifies which party must bear the cost of a sender's mistake with respect to remittance transfer.  Rather, EFTA section 919 gives the Bureau broad discretion to set standards for remittance transfer providers with respect to error resolution, including to define errors, and does not mandate a specific result with regard to which party should bear the risk of loss under any particular circumstances.  Nor does the Bureau believe that the definition of error in subpart A of Regulation E, which does not apply to all remittance transfers, precludes the Bureau from adopting more specifically tailored error resolutions, and corresponding definitions, applicable to all remittance transfers under subpart B of Regulation E. <em data-original="E-03">See also</em> § 1005.33(f).  Accordingly, the Bureau has adopted the proposed exception for sender account number mistakes subject to specific conditions discussed below.</analysisParagraph>

                  <analysisSection>
                    <title>The Scope of the Sender Error Exception</title>
                    <analysisParagraph>As noted above the Bureau also sought comment on the scope of the proposed exception to the definition of error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) and whether it should apply to incorrect information provided by senders in addition to designated recipients' account numbers and, in particular, whether the proposed exception should apply in cases in which senders make mistakes regarding routing numbers or similar institution identifiers in addition to mistakes regarding account numbers.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>In response, many industry commenters suggested that the proposed exception be expanded to refer to sender mistakes regarding any information provided by a sender in connection with a remittance transfer rather than just mistaken account numbers, as proposed.  Other commenters listed specific types of incorrect information that should be addressed by the exception to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv), such as:  Routing numbers, Business Identifier Codes (BICs), Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication codes (SWIFT codes), International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs), local bank codes, prepaid, debit or credit card account numbers, recipient institutions' names, designated recipients' names, escrow account numbers, currencies in which transfers will be received, incomplete wire instructions, and recipients' email addresses, phone numbers, and addresses.  Commenters offered different reasons as to why the proposed exception should be expanded to include sender mistakes regarding each suggested type of information.  In addition to considering these comments, the Bureau conducted additional outreach to understand the nature of errors related to the suggested types of information and why remittance transfer providers thought they should be included in any exception to an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) in the 2012 Final Rule.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Many of the industry commenters that urged that the proposed exception should be extended to all mistakes made by senders argued, as noted above, that there is no statutory basis to make remittance transfer providers bear the cost of all senders' mistakes.  Relatedly, one commenter argued that no other consumer finance statute protects consumers from their own errors and that there is a distinction between allocating risk to a provider for mistakes by third parties, or where fault cannot be determined, and requiring providers to bear the cost of senders' mistakes.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>As for the specific types of information provided by senders, nearly all industry commenters and some consumer group commenters favored expanding the proposed exception to apply to sender mistakes regarding routing numbers and other recipient institution identifiers.  Commenters explained that for many remittance transfers into accounts, remittance transfer providers request, in addition to the number of the designated recipient's account, an alphanumeric identifier of the recipient institution, similar to the routing numbers used to identify depository institutions in the United States.<footnote ref="9">For example, in order to route a wire transfer to a foreign bank, a bank in the United States may require that the sender provide the name of the designated recipient and the recipient's institution as well as the BIC for the recipient's institution, and the recipient's account number.</footnote>
                      Providers, and any other intermediaries involved in the transfer, then use this identifier to determine the institution to which the transfer should be sent.  Commenters further explained that, in many cases, a sender's mistake regarding the identifier of a bank could pose a similar problem for a provider as an incorrect account number.  The commenters stated that, like account numbers, many providers lack the ability to verify the accuracy of alphanumerical identifiers related to recipient institutions that are provided by senders.  If a recipient institution identifier is incorrect and the provider does not match it with an institution name, funds could conceivably be mis-deposited if the institution represented by the incorrect routing number has an account matching the number provided by the sender.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>In addition to sender  mistakes regarding account numbers and recipient institution identifiers, several commenters asked that the Bureau exclude from the definition of error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) senders' mistakes regarding correspondent routing instructions (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> if the sender suggests that the remittance transfer provider send the transfer through a particular correspondent that is unable to complete the transfer).  Several commenters stated that generally this sort of mistake generally would lead to a delay of a transfer and not its mis-deposit into the wrong account.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Finally, several industry commenters argued that the proposed exception should be expanded to apply to senders' mistakes regarding designated recipients' names and information that the designated recipient themselves might need to apply the proceeds of remittance transfers after receipt.  For example, a trade association commenter asked that the Bureau expand the proposed exception to include sender mistakes about additional information a designated recipient needs to process a transfer it receives.  The commenter stated that if, for example, the designated recipient is an insurer, it might need the designated recipient's policy number to process the funds received.  Similarly, one commenter stated that if a designated recipient is a property lessor, the lessor might need an identifying apartment number in order to process a transfer that is a rent payment.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>After careful consideration of the comments received and upon further consideration, the Bureau is expanding the exception to the definition of error in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to include situations where a sender has provided an incorrect recipient institution identifier in addition to situations where a sender provides an incorrect account number, as long as the error results in a mis-deposit of the funds and that the remittance transfer provider meets the conditions set forth in § 1005.33(h).  As discussed below, the 2013 Final Rule includes as one such condition, that the provider use reasonably available means to verify the recipient institution identifier provided by the sender. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(h)(2).</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Based on its monitoring of the remittance market, review of comment letters, and other outreach, the Bureau believes that situations in which an incorrect recipient institution identifier could result in a transfer being deposited into the wrong account are exceedingly rare but not unheard of.  More typically, the Bureau understands, a mistaken identifier will result in a transfer that is returned to the remittance transfer provider because either the identifier does not match any institution or the account number does not match an account at the institution to which the transfer is mistakenly directed.  Nevertheless, the Bureau is expanding the exception in the 2013 Final Rule beyond what was proposed because, upon further consideration, it believes that it is appropriate to treat mistakes in recipient institution identifiers similarly to mistakes in account numbers.  The two types of identifiers are similar in purpose and, in some cases, are combined into one.  In addition, these identifiers may not be easily verifiable by providers sending remittance transfers over an open network and are used in straight-through, automated processing of transfers.  Additionally, although less likely than as with respect to account numbers, under the 2012 Final Rule an unscrupulous sender could potentially provide an incorrect routing number to perpetrate a fraud with a coconspirator abroad.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Contrary to requests by commenters that the Bureau extend the proposed exception for sender mistakes regarding account numbers to mistakes regarding all types of information, the Bureau is limiting the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to sender mistakes regarding account numbers and recipient institution identifiers because it does not believe it is appropriate to extend the exception to all mistakes a sender might make in connection with a remittance transfer for several reasons.  While the chance of mis-deposit is limited for all sender mistakes, the Bureau believes there is a greater risk for mistakes regarding account numbers and recipient institution identifiers.  However, for most other types of sender mistakes identified by commenters, such as mistakes regarding the recipient's address or wire instructions, the Bureau does not believe that the incorrect information would usually result in a mis-deposit of a remittance transfer.  Instead, the Bureau believes that these mistakes will at most result in a delay of delivery or in non-delivery of the remittance transfer.  In situations where the recipient institution identifies a customer with the same name as the designated recipient but is unable to match that customer's name to the provided account number, the Bureau believes that the recipient institution will generally be unable to apply the funds and that the transfer will be returned or otherwise delayed but that the funds will not be mis-deposited.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe that it is warranted to extend the exception to those sender mistakes that are likely to result only in either a delay or a return of the transfer to the remittance transfer provider, and not the loss of funds, because the cost to the provider of delay or non-delivery differs markedly from the cost of lost transfers.  Under the 2012 Final Rule, when a transfer is delayed or returned to the provider, the provider must refund its fee to the sender. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii).  Additionally, when the transfer is returned to the provider, the sender can request that the transfer be resent at no charge (although third-party fees may be imposed on the resend) or have the transfer amount refunded. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii).  The cost to the provider in these circumstances differs markedly from the cost to the provider under the 2012 Final Rule for a transfer that is mis-deposited into the wrong account and cannot be retrieved.  When a mis-deposit occurs, absent an exception, the provider may have to resend or refund the entire transfer amount if the transfer could not be retrieved from the wrong account rather than merely refund its fee or send a transfer at no cost. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii) and comment 33(c)-2 in the 2012 Final Rule.  Thus, for mis-deposited transfers, the fact that the provider is potentially at risk of having to absorb a loss of principal is far higher than for other types of errors and thus is far more likely to lead to a significant curtailment of services.  Furthermore, the Bureau believes that, in many respects, the remedy under the 2012 Final Rule for non-delivery is similar to many providers' existing practices in that they now resend funds at no charge with the corrected information.  Therefore, to maintain as an error sender mistakes that merely result in delay or non-delivery of the remittance transfer as part of this final rule would not require a significant adjustment for those providers.  Finally, the 2012 Final Rule already allows providers a mechanism to manage uncertainty regarding the date of delivery of funds. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) and comment 32(b)(2)-1 (interpreting § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) to allow a provider to disclose the “latest date on which funds will be available”).</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters suggested that the Bureau should make senders, rather than providers, bear the costs of their own mistakes because no other consumer protection regimes makes the regulated entities bear the costs of consumers' mistakes.  The Bureau does not think it is necessary or appropriate that the remittances rules' remedy provisions match perfectly those in other consumer protection regimes, given the unique statutory structure and nature of the transactions at issue.  The Bureau is maintaining the 2012 Final Rule's error provisions regarding sender mistakes other than those covered by the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D), because it believes providers are generally in the best position to institute systems to limit their occurrence and to work with other industry participants to resolve particular mistakes in transmissions.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>With respect to those mistakes that are likely to result only in a delay or non-delivery of a remittance transfer (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> mistakes other than those regarding account number or the recipient institution identifier), the Bureau believes that retaining the current rule, which does not include an exception for such mistakes, strikes the appropriate balance been protecting senders and encouraging providers to limit the incidence of such errors without exposing providers to the risk of loss of the transfer amount.  With respect to those sender mistakes that make it impossible for the recipient (as opposed to the recipient institution) to know how to use the funds received (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> an apartment number to apply a rent payment), the Bureau does not believe that such mistakes would give rise to an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv).  This is true because the 2013 Final Rule only does not define as an error the inability of the designated recipient to timely apply the funds for a particular purpose once a transfer is received.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also does not believe that a sender's provision of an incorrect name would result in an error under the 2013 Final Rule, and thus a sender's provision of an incorrect name need not be included in the exception from the term error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D).  As defined under § 1005.30(c), a designated recipient is “any person specified by the sender as the authorized recipient of a remittance transfer to be received at a foreign country.”  As noted above, comment 30(c)-1 in the 2012 Final Rule stated that a designated recipient can be either a natural person or an organization, such as a corporation.  The Bureau is further clarifying this comment in the 2013 Final Rule to explain that the designated recipient is identified by the name of the person provided by the sender to the remittance transfer provider and disclosed by the provider to the sender pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(iii). <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 30(c)-1.  Thus, assume for example that a sender tells a remittance transfer provider to send a transfer to “Jane Doe” at a foreign bank, the provider discloses “Jane Doe” pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(2)(iii), and the transfer is timely deposited by that bank into Jane Doe's account.  If the sender later asserts that an error occurred because the sender in fact intended the transfer to be sent to “John Doe” but had not communicated that to the provider, no error has occurred under the final rule because “Jane Doe” was the name of the designated recipient stated on the receipt provided to the sender.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>In some cases, however, a sender's name can result in an error.  If, for example, the recipient institution could not deliver the remittance transfer described above because no one named “Jane Doe” had an account at the recipient institution, or more than one person named “Jane Doe” had an account at that institution such that the funds could not be applied, the transfer would be delayed or rejected resulting in an error because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information.  Insofar as this would not lead to the deposit of the transfer in the wrong account, the Bureau is not inclined to include these mistakes in the exception.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Commenters also urged the Bureau to include in the exception to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) to mistakes regarding mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and debit, credit and prepaid card numbers, arguing that these additional categories of identifiers warrant the same treatment as those covered by proposed § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D).  Commenters supporting expansion of the exception to include these identifiers generally put forth the same reasons as those discussed above regarding account numbers and recipient institution identifiers.  These commenters generally did not address the practical differences between transfers sent between bank accounts and those sent to other types of accounts.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not think it appropriate to extend the exception to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to these sorts of identifiers for several reasons.  First, § 1005.31(b)(2)(iii) requires that a remittance transfer provider disclose the name of the designated recipient to the sender and comment 30(c)-1 now clarifies that the designated recipient is identified by the name of the person stated on the disclosure provided pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(iii) regardless of what other identifying information that the sender may also have provided to the provider.  Insofar as a provider must disclose the name of the designated recipient on the receipt provided to the sender, the provider is not permitted to process a remittance transfer under the 2013 Final Rule by only disclosing a non-name identifier, such as a card number, email address, or mobile number.  To the extent providers currently send transfers without disclosing a name to the sender, they will not be able to continue doing so once the 2013 Final Rule takes effect.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Second, the Bureau believes that in the current market, only a small number of providers send remittance transfers to designated recipients who are identified by mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and debit, credit and prepaid card numbers.  These providers are often conducting transfers between two of their own customers through a closed network, and thus are in position to verify designated recipients' identities.  In other words, for transfers conducted through these closed-networks, both the sender and recipient will have agreed to sign on to the provider's network in order to send or receive funds.  The Bureau understands that, today, a number of the providers using these identifiers may not verify that the identifier matches the name of the designated recipient in every instance.  However, the Bureau believes that unlike providers using account numbers to identify designated recipients in transfers through the open network system, these providers have a reasonable ability to implement security measures in order to limit the possibility that senders make mistakes regarding designated recipients' mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and debit, credit and prepaid card numbers.  These measures might include confirmation codes, test transactions, or other methods to prevent transfers from being sent to the wrong person.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>Third, the Bureau believes that the systems are still limited and nascent for transfers in which the mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and debit, credit and prepaid card numbers are used to identify designated recipients and the transfer is not sent entirely over the remittance transfer provider's own network.  As these systems grow, the Bureau expects that providers can proactively design systems in such a way as to allow for the development of better verification protocols.  If, in the future, providers intend to develop new systems to allow transfers using only names and mobile phone numbers to identify designated recipients, for example, the Bureau believes that such systems should be designed to verify that the provided names and numbers match before recipients can receive transfers.  The Bureau does not believe that such methods can be implemented for most transfers sent to bank accounts.  As described above, such transfers are generally sent as wire transfers, through an open network system.</analysisParagraph>
                    <analysisParagraph>As noted, the Bureau has limited the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to account numbers and recipient institution identifiers in order to encourage the growth of improved controls and communication mechanisms that may generally limit the possibility of other errors in the transmission of remittance transfers.  Furthermore, the Bureau intends to monitor closely industry's ability to verify account numbers and recipient institution identifiers and will consider modifying this exception if it thinks such verification methods become reasonably available and are able to prevent most errors from occurring.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>33(a) Definition of Error</title>
            <analysisSection>
              <title>Definition of Error Generally</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(a)(1) defined the term “error” for purposes of the remittance transfer error resolution provisions. Proposed § 205.33(a)(2) listed types of transfers or inquiries that do not constitute errors. The proposed commentary provided additional guidance illustrating errors under the rule.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters generally believed the proposed error definitions were overly broad because they would subject a remittance transfer provider to liability for errors caused by parties outside the control of the provider. Some of these commenters suggested that requiring providers to assume responsibility for errors when the provider has not erred nor controlled the circumstances that caused the error would undermine the safety and soundness of these transfer systems and could lead some financial institutions to eliminate remittance transfer services. Other industry commenters predicted that the financial impact of losses experienced as a result of errors caused by another party could be significant enough for providers to exit the market.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is amending certain error definitions in response to these comments, as discussed below. In general, under a number of financial consumer protection laws, the regulated entity has the responsibility to investigate errors asserted by consumers and generally assumes much of the liability when an error has occurred even where neither the regulated entity nor the consumer are at fault. <em data-original="E-03">See, e.g.,</em> 15 U.S.C. 1693f and 1693g; 15 U.S.C. 1643; 12 CFR 1005.11; and 12 CFR 1026.13. Thus, consistent with other error resolution procedures in Federal financial consumer protection laws, the Bureau believes that where neither a sender nor a remittance transfer provider are necessarily at fault, a provider generally is in a better position than a sender to identify, and possibly recover from, the party at fault.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, placing liability with the remittance transfer provider in these instances aligns the remittance transfer provider's incentives with those of the sender. Remittance transfer providers are likely better able to work with parties in the remittance transfer system or government entities to reduce errors to remittance transfers overall. Placing responsibility on providers increases the incentives of providers to develop such policies, procedures, and controls. As a result, the Bureau does not believe that whether a particular circumstance constitutes an error should necessarily depend on whether a provider is at fault. The Bureau further notes that this is similar to the approach taken in defining “errors” under § 1005.11 for EFTs where something may be considered an “error” even if the financial institution did not cause the error.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>33(a)(1)(i) Incorrect Amount Paid by Sender</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(i) defined “error” to include an incorrect amount paid by a sender in connection with a remittance transfer. This element of the definition is similar to the error described in § 1005.11(a)(1)(ii) of an incorrect EFT to or from a consumer's account. The Board also proposed comment 33(a)-1 to clarify that proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(i) was intended to cover circumstances in which the amount paid by the sender differs from the total amount of the transaction stated in the receipt or the combined disclosure. Proposed comment 33(a)-1 also stated that an error under § 205.33(a)(1)(i) covered incorrect amounts paid by a sender regardless of the form or method of payment tendered by the sender for the transfer, including when a debit, credit, or prepaid card is used to pay an amount in excess of the amount of the transfer requested by the sender plus applicable fees.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Commenters did not specifically address proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(i) or proposed comment 33(a)-1. The Bureau adopts proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(i) substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(a)(1)(i). The Bureau also adopts comment 33(a)-1 substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>33(a)(1)(ii) Computational or Bookkeeping Error</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(ii), an “error” also included “a computational or bookkeeping error made by a remittance transfer provider relating to a remittance transfer.” This provision is similar to an existing computational or bookkeeping error provision for EFTs in § 1005.11(a)(iv). In implementing this provision of Regulation E, the Board noted that § 1005.11(a)(iv) (formerly § 205.11(a)(iv)) is intended to include “arithmetical errors, posting errors, errors in printing figures, and figures that were jumbled due to mechanical or electronic malfunction.” <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 44 FR 59480 (Oct. 15, 1979). Proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(ii) was meant to cover similar types of errors with respect to remittance transfers, such as circumstances in which a remittance transfer provider fails to reflect all fees that will be imposed in connection with the transfer or misapplies the applicable exchange rate in calculating the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient. As noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, notwithstanding that the designated recipient may receive the amount of currency stated on the receipt or combined disclosure, an error could be asserted because the provider incorrectly calculated the amount that should have been received. The Bureau did not receive any comments on proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(ii). The Bureau adopts this provision as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(a)(1)(ii).</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisSection>
              <title>33(a)(1)(iii) Incorrect Amount Received by the Designated Recipient</title>
              <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iii) to provide that an “error” generally included the failure by a remittance transfer provider to make available to a designated recipient the amount of currency identified in the receipt or combined disclosure given to the sender, unless the disclosure provided an estimate made in accordance with proposed § 205.32 (adopted as § 1005.32 above). The Board also proposed guidance in comment 33(a)-2 regarding the scope of the error under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iii). Furthermore, proposed comment 33(a)-3 provided examples illustrating circumstances in which an incorrect amount of currency may be received by a designated recipient.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter recommended that the exclusion of estimated disclosures made pursuant to § 1005.32 from the definition of “error” under renumbered § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) should be applied to other errors listed in § 1005.33(a)(1). The Bureau notes, however, that none of the other errors in § 1005.33(a)(1) rely on the difference between what may be disclosed as an estimate and the actual amount. For example, suppose a remittance transfer is permitted to estimate disclosures under § 1005.32. If the remittance transfer provider fails to deliver any funds to the designated recipient, the sender should be able to assert an error even though the provider disclosed an estimate. As a result, the Bureau declines to make the requested change, and the exclusion of estimated disclosures made pursuant to § 1005.32 is adopted as renumbered § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii)(A).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau has added language to clarify that the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii)(A) from the definition of “error” applies if the difference results from application of the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes, rather than any estimated amounts. This clarification prevents a remittance transfer provider from relying on the exception for estimates if it makes available to the designated recipient an amount that is completely unrelated to the amount calculated using the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes. For example, if the remittance transfer provider estimated the amount to be received pursuant to § 1005.32 as 1,200 pesos in the receipt or combined disclosure, and the amount calculated using the applicable actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes is 1,150 pesos, the provider cannot use the § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii)(A) exception to claim that there is no error if it made only 100 pesos available to the designated recipient.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail below, several industry commenters requested expansion of the exception to the error defined in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) for extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated. The Bureau believes that it is appropriate to provide this exception for an error involving an incorrect amount received by the designated recipient. For example, suppose a foreign government in the country where a remittance transfer is to be delivered imposes an emergency tax on the transfer that was not in effect nor could have been reasonably anticipated at the time the provider was required to give the sender the receipt or combined disclosure. The failure to make available to the designated recipient the amount of currency identified in the receipt or combined disclosure given to the sender, which did not reflect the emergency tax, should not constitute an error if the designated recipient received the disclosed amount of currency less the emergency tax.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As a result, new § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii)(B) provides that the failure to make the amount of currency stated in the receipt or combined disclosure is not an error if the failure resulted from extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated. Furthermore, the Bureau adopts new comment 33(a)-4 to provide guidance on what types of extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated qualify for the exception. The comment is similar to the comment adopted as comment 33(a)-6 below, which describes extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated for purposes of the error for failure to make funds available by the disclosed date of availability in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 33(a)-2 is adopted with a change to clarify that if a provider rounds the exchange rate used to calculate the amount received consistent with § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) and comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-2 for the disclosed rate, there is no error if the designated recipient receives an amount of currency that results from applying the exchange rate used, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate, to calculate fees, taxes, and the amount received rather than the disclosed rate. The change is intended to be consistent with the Bureau's general approach to rounding exchange rates as described above in the supplementary information to comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-2. Proposed comment 33(a)-3 is adopted substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>33(a)(1)(iv) Failure To Make Funds Available by Date of Availability</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv) generally defined an “error” to include a remittance transfer provider's failure to make funds in connection with a remittance transfer available to the designated recipient by the date of availability stated on the receipt or combined disclosure, subject to two specified exceptions, discussed below. The Board proposed comment 33(a)-4 to provide examples of the circumstances that would have been considered errors under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv). These circumstances included: (i) The late delivery of a remittance transfer after the stated date of availability or non-delivery of the transfer; (ii) the deposit of a remittance transfer to the wrong account; (iii) retention of the transferred funds by a recipient agent or institution after the stated date of availability, rather than making the funds available to the designated recipient; and (iv) the fraudulent pick-up of a remittance transfer in a foreign country by a person other than the person identified by the sender as the designated recipient of the transfer. Fraudulent pick-up, however, did not include circumstances in which a designated recipient picks up a remittance transfer from the provider's agent as authorized, but subsequently the funds are stolen from the recipient.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters objected to the inclusion of fraudulent pick-up as an error. These commenters suggested that the remittance transfer provider should not be responsible for fraud that results in the pick-up of a remittance transfer by a person other than the designated recipient where the provider is unlikely to know or have control over all the intermediary institutions involved in the transfer or the final institution that will make the funds available to the designated recipient. Other commenters, including the OCC, suggested that this error might result in “friendly fraud” where a sender claims the amount was not an authorized pick-up when the pick-up was actually legitimate. The OCC was also concerned that the exposure to remittance transfer providers for this error may be aggravated in situations involving large dollar remittances and because of the long period of time that a sender could assert this error.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter noted that while there may be certain instances when fraudulent pick-up should be considered an error, there may be other circumstances when fraudulent pick-up should not be an error. In particular, this commenter suggested that where the name of the person picking up the funds does not match the name of the designated recipient set forth in the receipt, the sender should be able to assert an error. However, if an individual presents fake identification in the name of the designated recipient, this commenter stated that this fraudulent pick-up is outside of the remittance transfer provider's control and therefore, should not be considered an error. Industry commenters also believed that a remittance transfer provider should not be liable for a fraudulent pick-up when a provider and its agent has complied with fraud and risk management policies and procedures.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As the Board noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, treating fraudulent pick-up of a remittance transfer as an error is consistent with the scope of unauthorized EFTs under § 1005.2(m), which includes unauthorized EFTs initiated through fraudulent means. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 2(m)-3. Although identity theft can present a challenge to remittance transfer providers, financial institutions face similar challenges with respect to unauthorized EFTs and bear most of the risk. Moreover, similar to remittance transfers, the entity in the best position to verify the identity of the person initiating the EFT (for example, the merchant at a store who initiates an EFT using a debit card) may not be known or controlled by the financial institution, though such entities may have agreed to abide by system rules (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> payment card network rules, ACH system rules). However, under current laws governing EFTs, whether the financial institution knows or has control over that entity (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> a merchant) does not affect whether an EFT could be an unauthorized EFT. Similarly, the Bureau believes that whether a fraudulent pick-up should be considered an error should not be affected by the relationship between the remittance transfer provider and the entity distributing the remittance transfer to the designated recipient.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, the Bureau agrees with the Board's reasoning in the May 2011 Proposed Rule that it is appropriate to treat these circumstances as errors because the remittance transfer provider, rather than the sender, is in the best position to ensure that a remittance transfer is picked up only by the person designated by the sender. For example, in some models, remittance transfer providers could require or contract with the entity distributing the funds, if it is not the remittance transfer provider itself, to request and examine identification from the person picking up the funds. The Bureau believes that including fraudulent pick-up as an error would better align the remittance transfer provider's incentives to prevent this occurrence with the interests of the sender.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter suggested that a sender be required to inform the remittance transfer provider if the confirmation number or receipt is lost or stolen. For some remittance transfer providers, a designated recipient is required to give the confirmation number, which is generally printed on the receipt, in order to obtain access to the funds in a remittance transfer. The commenter suggested that this approach would be similar to the approach taken with respect to a lost or stolen access device in § 1005.6(b) with respect to unauthorized EFTs, where a consumer's liability for unauthorized EFTs is dependent on how quickly the consumer reports the lost or stolen access device to the account-holder financial institution.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes, however, the risk for a lost or stolen confirmation number is not the same as for a lost or stolen access device for EFTs. A lost or stolen access device could potentially be used to initiate an EFT by a person who is not the account holder immediately without an accomplice and without identification matching the name associated with the access device. By contrast, where a confirmation number given to the sender is lost or stolen, an unauthorized person who gains access to the number would not be able to take advantage of it unless he or she were located or had an accomplice in the recipient country. Furthermore, because access to funds sent by a remittance transfer provider is often limited to those with identification matching the designated recipient on the receipt, an unauthorized person who gains access to a lost or stolen confirmation number may be deterred from taking advantage of it. Consequently, the Bureau does not believe that a sender's liability should depend on whether he or she reports a confirmation number or receipt as lost or stolen.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Moreover, under § 1005.6(b), a consumer's liability for unauthorized EFTs is dependent on how quickly the consumer reports the lost or stolen access device because the speed with which a consumer reports the lost or stolen access device may be critical to preventing further unauthorized EFTs and further losses, and the possibility of increased liability provides incentives for a consumer to report quickly. In contrast, a lost or stolen confirmation number would not result in losses other than the specific remittance transfer in question. Therefore, the Bureau also does not believe that a sender's liability should depend on how quickly a sender reports a lost or stolen confirmation number.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting comment 33(a)-4, renumbered as comment 33(a)-5, generally as proposed. Specifically, the Bureau is including a statement to clarify that if only a portion of the funds were made available by the disclosed date of availability, then § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) does not apply, but § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) may apply instead.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisSection>
                <title>Exceptions to the Failure To Make Funds Available by Date of Availability</title>
                <analysisParagraph>As noted above, the proposed rule provided two exceptions to the definition of “error” in proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv). Under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(A), the failure to make funds from a remittance transfer available by the stated date of availability did not constitute an error if the failure resulted from circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control. Under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(B), the failure to make funds from a remittance transfer available on the stated date of availability did not constitute an error if it was caused by the sender providing incorrect information in connection with the remittance transfer to the provider, so long as the provider gives the sender the opportunity to correct the information and resend the transfer at no additional cost. The Bureau adopts one of these two exceptions with changes to respond to commenters' concerns, as discussed below. The other exception has been moved to the remedies section under § 1005.33(c)(2) for the reasons discussed below. The Bureau is also adopting two additional exceptions to the definition of “error” in proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv).</analysisParagraph>

                <title>Exception for Extraordinary Circumstances Outside of the Remittance Transfer Provider's Control</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(A) provided that the failure to make funds from a remittance transfer available by the stated date of availability did not constitute an error if the failure resulted from circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control. Proposed comment 33(a)-5 clarified that the exception was limited to circumstances that are generally referred to under contract law as force majeure, or uncontrollable or extraordinary circumstances that cannot be reasonably anticipated by the remittance transfer provider and that prevent the provider from delivering a remittance transfer, such as war, civil unrest, or a natural disaster. The proposed comment also provided that the exception for circumstances beyond a provider's control covered government actions or other restrictions that occur after the transfer has been sent but that could not have been reasonably anticipated by the remittance transfer provider, such as the imposition of foreign currency controls or the garnishment or attachment of funds.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters stated that the proposed comment limiting the circumstances beyond the provider's control to instances of force majeure or to other uncontrollable or extraordinary circumstances was too narrow. Several industry commenters recommended that the exception should be more broadly interpreted to exclude errors caused by acts of a third party beyond a remittance transfer provider's control. Consumer group commenters believed the approach in the proposed rule was a reasonable limitation and recommended that the commentary specifically state that mistakes by a recipient institution do not fall under the exception to the error to deliver funds by the date of delivery. Other consumer group commenters suggested that the final rule limit the circumstances even further to only include acts of war or terrorism or natural disaster.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau does not believe that whether a particular circumstance constitutes an error or not should necessarily depend on whether a provider is at fault. Even if the error is caused by a third party beyond the remittance transfer provider's control, the Bureau believes that the remittance transfer provider is often in a better position to identify and recover the loss from the third party than a sender, especially when there are multiple intermediary institutions involved in a transfer. Accordingly, the Bureau believes that with respect to third-party errors, the circumstances in proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(A) should include only a narrow category of third-party errors caused by uncontrollable or extraordinary circumstances that cannot be reasonably anticipated by the remittance transfer provider and that prevent the provider from delivering a remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, the Bureau believes the proposed comment is appropriately narrow in interpreting the limited set of circumstances for which the failure to make funds available by the disclosed date of delivery should not be an error. Therefore, proposed comment 33(a)-5 is adopted substantially as proposed in comment 33(a)-6. The Bureau is adopting proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(A) generally as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(A). However, the Bureau is adding language to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(A) to more accurately reflect the descriptions of the types of circumstances listed in comment 33(a)-6. Specifically, § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(A) provides that a failure to make funds available by the disclosed date of delivery is not an error if the failure resulted from extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>Exception for Sender Providing Incorrect or Insufficient Information</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(B) provided that the failure to make funds from a remittance transfer available on the stated date of availability did not constitute an error if it was caused by the sender providing incorrect information in connection with the remittance transfer to the provider, so long as the provider gives the sender the opportunity to correct the information and resend the transfer at no additional cost. Proposed comment 33(a)-6 clarified that if the failure to make funds from a transfer available by the stated date of availability occurred due to the <em data-original="E-03">provider's</em> miscommunication of information necessary for the designated recipient to pick up the transfer, such as providing the incorrect location where the transfer may be picked up or providing the wrong confirmation number or code for the transfer, such failure would have been treated as an error under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv).</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters objected to the requirement that the remittance transfer provider absorb the costs of amending and resending a transfer when the sender is at fault. These commenters noted that modifying transfers can be expensive and that the proposed rule would, in effect, require the remittance transfer provider and other senders, through higher fees, to bear the responsibility for a sender's mistake.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with commenters that a sender's mistake should not obligate a remittance transfer provider to bear all the costs for resending the remittance transfer. However, the Bureau believes that while the remittance transfer provider should not bear all the costs in these circumstances, the failure should still be considered an error such that the error resolution procedures apply. Therefore, the Bureau is moving the concept in proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(B) to a new § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), and proposed comment 33(a)-6 to renumbered comment 33(c)-2, as discussed further below.</analysisParagraph>

                <title>Additional Exceptions</title>
                <analysisParagraph>In the final rule, the Bureau is adding two additional exceptions to the definition of “error” in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) based on a consideration of comments received. New § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(B) provides that delays in making funds available to a designated recipient that are related to a provider's fraud screening procedures or in accordance with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), 31 U.S.C. 5311 <em data-original="E-03">et seq.,</em> Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) requirements, or similar laws or requirements would not constitute an error. Several industry commenters and the OCC noted that for fraud screening, BSA, or OFAC purposes, a remittance transfer provider may have further communications with the sender to ensure the legitimacy or the legality of a remittance transfer. This, in turn, may cause delays in making the funds available to a designated recipient. The Bureau believes it is appropriate to exclude these situations from the definition of “error” in order to encourage remittance transfer providers to continue to engage in activities that benefit the safety of the transfer system as a whole. The Bureau understands that under current procedures, these types of delays are generally infrequent, relative to the number of remittance transfers typically conducted by remittance transfer providers.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adopting a new § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C) in response to industry commenters' and the OCC's concerns about “friendly fraud.” Consequently, consistent with the definition of “unauthorized electronic fund transfer” under § 1005.2(m), and as suggested by the OCC to address its concerns regarding the error of fraudulent pick-up, § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C) provides an exception to the “error” definition for remittance transfers made with fraudulent intent by the sender or any person in concert with the sender. Therefore, if a sender is involved in a scheme to defraud the remittance transfer provider, for example, by fraudulently claiming that the designated recipient did not pick up funds that the designated recipient in fact did pick up, such action would not be considered an “error” under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C).</analysisParagraph>

              <title>33(a)(1)(v) Sender's Request for Documentation</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Finally, under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(v), an error included a sender's request for documentation provided in connection with a remittance transfer or additional information or clarification concerning a remittance transfer. This provision is similar to an existing provision in § 1005.11(a)(1)(vii) for EFTs. As the Board noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, an error under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(v) would also cover a sender's request for information to determine whether an error exists. The Bureau did not receive any comments on proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(v). The Bureau adopts proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(v) substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(a)(1)(v).</analysisParagraph>

              <title>33(a)(2) Types of Inquiries and Transfers Not Covered</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(a)(2) listed circumstances that would not constitute errors. In particular, proposed § 205.33(a)(2)(i) provided that an inquiry about a transfer of $15 or less does not constitute an error, since these small-value transfers do not fall within the scope of the definition of “remittance transfer.” <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.30(e)(2), discussed above. Under proposed § 205.33(a)(2)(ii), an inquiry about the status of a remittance transfer—for example, if the sender calls to ask whether the funds have been made available in the foreign country—would also not be an error (unless the funds have not been made available by the disclosed date of availability). Finally, similar to § 1005.11(a)(2)(ii) for EFTs, a sender's request for information for tax or other recordkeeping purposes would not constitute an error under proposed § 205.33(a)(2)(iii).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that because transfers of $15 or less are not “remittance transfers” under § 1005.30(e)(2), such transfers are not covered under the remittance transfer provisions in subpart B. Therefore, the Bureau believes it is not necessary to state that an inquiry involving a transfer of $15 or less is not an error, and is not adopting proposed § 205.33(a)(2)(i). A Federal Reserve Bank commenter noted that for certain assertions of error that exceed the $15 threshold, providers may still not have the ability to investigate the assertion because they are less than the minimum amount traceable in a foreign country. In order to ensure that senders are protected with respect to errors related to remittance transfers other than truly <em data-original="E-03">de minimis</em> amounts, however, the Bureau is not inclined to create another threshold amount above the $15 coverage threshold for which an inquiry is not an error. The Bureau did not receive comments on proposed § 205.33(a)(2)(ii) or (iii). These provisions are adopted as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(a)(2)(i) and (ii), respectively.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In the final rule, the Bureau is adopting provisions describing two other circumstances that do not constitute errors in response to comments received. Section 1005.33(a)(2)(iii) provides that a change requested by the designated recipient is not an error. Comment 33(a)-7 clarifies new § 1005.33(a)(2)(iii) by providing that the exception is available only if the change is made solely because the designated recipient requested the change. The comment also includes an illustrative example. The example explains that if a sender requests a remittance transfer provider to send US$100 to a designated recipient at a designated location, but the designated recipient requests the amount in a different currency (either at the sender-designated location or another location requested by the recipient) and the remittance transfer provider accommodates the recipient's request, the change does not constitute an error.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau understands that as a service to the recipient, a remittance transfer provider may offer to provide the remittance transfer in a different currency or permit the transfer to be picked up at a location different than originally requested by the sender. In such cases, the Bureau believes that this type of customer service should be preserved. The Bureau, however, is concerned that remittance transfer providers may try to provide the remittance transfer to the designated recipient in a different currency simply because the provider or its agent do not have sufficient amounts of the sender-requested currency on hand. Therefore, the Bureau believes that this exception should only be available if the change is made solely because the designated recipient requested the change.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.33(a)(2)(iv) is also new and provides that an error does not include a change in the amount or type of currency received by the designated recipient from the amount or type of currency stated in the disclosure provided to the sender under § 1005.31(b)(2) or (3) if the remittance transfer provider relied on information provided by the sender as permitted by the commentary accompanying § 1005.31 in making such disclosure. As discussed above, a remittance transfer provider may rely on the sender's representations in making certain disclosures. For example, a remittance transfer provider can rely on the representations of the sender regarding the currency that can be provided in the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>New comment 33(a)-8 elaborates on the exclusion by providing two illustrative examples. Under one example, a sender requests U.S. dollars to be deposited into an account of the designated recipient and represents that the account is U.S. dollar-denominated. If the designated recipient's account is actually denominated in local currency and the recipient account-holding institution must convert the remittance transfer into local currency in order to deposit the funds and complete the transfer, the change in currency does not constitute an error pursuant to § 1005.33(a)(2)(iv). Similarly, if the remittance transfer provider relies on the sender's representations regarding variables that affect the amount of taxes imposed by a person other than the provider for purposes of determining these taxes, the change in the amount of currency the designated recipient actually receives due to the taxes actually imposed does not constitute an error pursuant to § 1005.33(a)(2)(iv).</analysisParagraph>

              <title>33(b) Notice of Error From Sender</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(b) set forth the timing and content requirements for a notice of error provided by a sender in connection with a remittance transfer. Consistent with EFTA section 919(d)(1)(A), proposed § 205.33(b)(1)(i) stated that a sender must provide a notice of error orally or in writing to the remittance transfer provider no later than 180 days after the date of availability of the remittance transfer stated in the receipt or combined disclosure. Under proposed § 205.33(b)(1)(ii), such notice of error must enable the remittance transfer provider to identify: the sender's name and telephone number or address; the recipient's name, and if known, the telephone number or address of the recipient; and the remittance transfer to which the notice of error applies. Proposed § 205.33(b)(1)(iii) stated that the notice must also indicate why the sender believes the error exists and include to the extent possible the type, date, and amount of the error, except in the case of requests for documentation, additional information, or clarification under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(v).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters suggested that the time period for senders to assert an error is too long. Some industry commenters recommended that the time period be shortened to 60 days, similar to the time period that consumers have to assert errors for EFTs. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.11(b)(3). Other industry commenters suggested 30 days. The Bureau notes that the 180-day time period for senders to assert an error is expressly stated in the statute. Given the international nature of remittance transfers, the additional time a sender may need to communicate with persons abroad, and the lack of information about problems associated with this time period, the Bureau does not believe that using its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to change this time period is currently warranted.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters also requested that the sender be required to assert an error in writing at a centralized address. The Bureau believes that requiring senders to assert an error in writing would have a chilling effect on the error resolution process, especially given that some senders may not feel comfortable writing in English. Although in some cases, a sender may have the ability to assert the error in a foreign language and be assured a response in that language, that ability may depend on the foreign languages used at the office of the remittance transfer provider where the error is asserted to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers under § 1005.31(g), as discussed above. Moreover, the current error resolution process for EFTs does not require a consumer to assert an error in writing.<footnote ref="81">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; § 1005.11(b). Although a financial institution may request that a consumer assert the error in writing, a consumer's failure to do so does not cancel the error resolution process, but gives the financial institution 45 days to investigate the error without having to provide provisional credit. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; § 1005.11(b)(2) and (c)(2).</footnote>
                Therefore, the Bureau declines to make the requested change, and proposed § 205.33(b)(1) is adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(b)(1).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(b)(2) provided that when a notice of error was based on documentation, additional information, or clarification that the sender had previously requested under § 1005.33(a)(1)(v), the sender's notice of error would be timely if it were received by the provider no later than 60 days after the provider sends the requested documentation, information, or clarification. As the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the proposed 60-day time frame for the sender to provide a new notice of error following the sender's receipt of documentation, information, or clarification from the remittance transfer provider is consistent with the 60-day time frame established for similar circumstances under the general error resolution provisions in Regulation E, § 1005.11(b)(3).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with the Board's reasoning that under these circumstances, 60 days, rather than the 180-day error resolution time frame generally applicable to remittance transfers, provides sufficient time for a sender to review the additional information provided by the remittance transfer provider and determine whether an error occurred in connection with a transfer. The Bureau did not receive any comments on this issue. However, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to clarify that a sender always has the original 180 days after the disclosed date of availability to assert an error. Consequently, the Bureau is amending proposed § 205.33(b)(2), renumbered as § 1005.33(b)(2), to provide that when a notice of error is based on documentation, additional information, or clarification that the sender had previously requested under § 1005.33(a)(1)(v), the sender's notice of error is timely if received by the remittance transfer provider the later of 180 days after the disclosed date of availability of the remittance transfer or 60 days after the provider sent the documentation, information, or clarification requested.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed commentary to clarify proposed § 205.33(b). Proposed comment 33(b)-1 clarified that the error resolution procedures for remittance transfers apply only when a notice of error is received from the sender of the transfer. Thus, a notice of error provided by the designated recipient would not trigger the remittance transfer provider's error resolution obligations. As the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, this interpretation is consistent with EFTA section 919(d)(1)(A), which establishes error resolution obligations for a remittance transfer provider only when a notice is received from the sender.<footnote ref="82">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See also&lt;/em&gt; EFTA section 919(g)(1) (providing that a designated recipient “shall not be deemed to be a consumer for purposes of this Act”).</footnote>
                Proposed comment 33(b)-1 also clarified that the error resolution provisions do not apply when the remittance transfer provider itself discovers and corrects an error. The Bureau did not receive any comments on the proposed comment, which the Bureau adopts as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed comment 33(b)-2 to provide that a notice of error is effective so long as the remittance transfer provider is able to identify the remittance transfer in question. As explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, a sender could provide in the notice of error the confirmation number or code given to the sender for the pick-up of a remittance transfer to identify the particular transfer in their tracking systems and records, or any other identification number or code supplied by the provider in connection with the remittance transfer, if such number or code is sufficient to enable the provider to identify the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter requested that, for an account-based remittance transfer, the final rule require senders to include the account number in the notice of error. The Bureau notes that under comment 11(b)(1)-1 for EFTs, consumers are not required to provide their account numbers and need only provide sufficient information to enable the financial institution to identify the account. Similarly, the Bureau believes that a sender need not provide the account number, but must provide enough information such that the remittance transfer provider can identify the account and the transfer in question. The Bureau adopts comment 33(b)-2 with this clarification, and also makes other clarifying changes to comment 33(b)-2 to make the comment consistent with § 1005.33(b)(1).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 33(b)-3 provided that a remittance transfer provider may request, or the sender may provide, an email address of the sender or the designated recipient, as applicable, instead of a physical address if the email address would be sufficient to enable the provider to identify the remittance transfer to which the notice applies. Proposed comment 33(b)-4 provided that if the sender fails to provide a timely notice of error within 180 days from the stated date of delivery, the remittance transfer provider would not be required to comply with the error resolution requirements set forth in the rule. As the Board noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, proposed comment 33(b)-4 is similar to comment 11(b)(1)-7 for EFTs. The Bureau did not receive any comments on these proposed comments. Therefore, the Bureau adopts comment 33(b)-3 substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>However, given that a sender may provide a second notice of error based on documentation, additional information, or clarification that the sender requested pursuant to § 1005.33(b)(2), as discussed above, the Bureau is revising comment 33(b)-4 to include the time periods relevant to § 1005.33(b)(2). Consequently, comment 33(b)-4 provides that, if applicable, a remittance transfer provider is not required to comply with the error resolution requirements for any notice of error from a sender that is received by the provider more than 60 days after a provider sent documentation, additional information, or clarification requested by the sender, provided such date is later than 180 days after the disclosed date of availability.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed comment 33(b)-5 to provide that a notice of error from a sender received by a remittance transfer provider's agent is deemed to be received by the provider for purposes of the 180-day time frame for reporting errors under § 1005.33(b)(1)(i). Some industry commenters suggested that senders should only be permitted to assert an error at a centralized address or telephone number. These commenters noted that because remittance transfers are not the primary business for most or all of the agents of a remittance transfer provider, relying on an agent to properly forward disputes and relevant supporting documents to the remittance transfer provider would impose unnecessary costs on agents. Commenters also argued that introducing agents into the error resolution process would increase the likelihood that disputes would not be handled and resolved in a timely way.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As the Board noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, a sender that has a problem or issue with a particular remittance transfer may contact the agent location that the sender used to send the transfer to resolve the problem or issue, rather than notifying the provider directly. The Bureau agrees with the Board that because in many cases, for transfers sent through money transmitters, it will be the agent with whom the sender has a direct relationship, and not the provider, it is appropriate to treat a notice of error given to the agent as notice to the provider. This approach also ensures that a sender does not lose his or her error resolution rights merely because the sender was unaware of a need to directly notify the provider. This is consistent with the approach the Bureau is taking with respect to a sender asserting his or her right to cancel, as discussed in further detail below in comment 34(a)-4. Moreover, the Bureau notes that the comment does not require the agent to perform the error resolution procedures. Remittance transfer providers may require their agents to pass on any error notice they receive to the remittance transfer providers, who can then fulfill the requirements of § 1005.33. Therefore, the Bureau adopts proposed comment 33(b)-5 substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Finally, proposed comment 33(b)-6 cross-referenced the disclosure requirements in § 205.31 to reiterate that a remittance transfer provider must include an abbreviated notice of the consumer's error resolution rights on the receipt under § 205.31(b)(2) or combined disclosure under § 205.31(b)(3), as applicable. In addition, the proposed comment provided that the remittance transfer provider must make available to a sender upon request, a notice providing a full description of error resolution rights that is substantially similar to the model error resolution and cancellation notice set forth in Appendix A of this regulation (Model Form A-36). The Bureau did not receive any comments on the proposed comment. The Bureau adopts comment 33(b)-6 substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>33(g) Error Resolution Standards and Recordkeeping Requirements</title>
            <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to EFTA section 919(d)(2), the Bureau must establish clear and appropriate standards for remittance transfer providers with respect to error resolution relating to remittance transfers, to protect senders from such errors. EFTA section 919(d)(2) specifically provides that such standards must include appropriate standards regarding recordkeeping, including retention of certain error-resolution related documentation. The Board proposed § 205.33(g) to implement these error resolution standards and recordkeeping requirements.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Specifically, proposed § 205.33(g)(1) provided that a remittance transfer provider must develop and maintain written policies and procedures that are designed to ensure compliance with respect to the error resolution requirements applicable to remittance transfers. The proposed rule also stated that remittance transfer providers must take steps to ensure that whenever a provider uses an agent to perform any of the provider's error resolution obligations, the agent conducts such activity in accordance with the provider's policies and procedures. As noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, this approach is similar to one taken by the Federal banking agencies in other contexts. <em data-original="E-03">See, e.g.,</em> 12 CFR 1022.90(e) (requiring that an identity theft red flags program exercise appropriate and effective oversight of service-provider arrangements).</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter suggested that the failure to maintain written policies and procedures should not be an independent cause of action. The Bureau believes that remittance transfer providers must develop written policies and procedures in order to demonstrate compliance to the appropriate regulator. Therefore, the Bureau does not believe the requirement to maintain written policies and procedures that the remittance transfer provider must follow imposes any additional burden.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is making one change to proposed § 205.33(g)(1). Specifically, the Bureau is deleting the provision in proposed § 205.33(g)(1) that requires remittance transfer providers to take steps to ensure that when a provider uses an agent to perform any of the provider's error resolution obligations, the agent conducts such activity in accordance with the provider's policies and procedures. The Bureau believes that this provision is no longer necessary in light of the decision under § 1005.35, discussed below, to provide that a remittance transfer provider is liable for any violation of subpart B by an agent when such agent acts for the provider. Proposed § 205.33(g)(1), as revised, is adopted in renumbered § 1005.33(g)(1).</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Under proposed § 205.33(g)(2) a remittance transfer provider's policies and procedures concerning error resolution would be required to include provisions regarding the retention of documentation related to an error investigation. Such provisions would be required to ensure, at a minimum, the retention of any notices of error submitted by a sender, documentation provided by the sender to the provider with respect to the alleged error, and the findings of the remittance transfer provider regarding the investigation of the alleged error, which is consistent with EFTA section 919(d)(2).</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 33(g)-1 clarified that remittance transfer providers are subject to the record retention requirements under § 1005.13, which apply to any person subject to the EFTA. Accordingly, remittance transfer providers would be required to retain documentation, including documentation related to error investigations, for a period of not less than two years from the date a notice of error was submitted to the provider or action was required to be taken by the provider. Similar to comment 13-1, proposed comment 33(g)-1 provided that the record retention requirements do not require a remittance transfer provider to maintain records of individual disclosures of remittance transfers that it has provided to each sender. Instead, a provider need only retain records to ensure that it can comply with a sender's request for documentation or other information relating to a particular remittance transfer, including a request for supporting documentation to enable the sender to determine whether an error exists with respect to that transfer. The Bureau did not receive any comments on proposed § 205.33(g)(2) or proposed comment 33(g)-1. The Bureau adopts proposed § 205.33(g)(2) substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(g)(2), but with an amendment to make clear that remittance transfer providers are subject to the record retention requirements under § 1005.13. The Bureau also adopts comment 33(g)-1 with amendments to conform the comment to comment 13-1 and to the changes in § 1005.33(g)(2).</analysisParagraph>

            <title>33(f) Relation to Other Laws</title>
            <analysisParagraph>As the Board noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the error resolution rights for remittance transfers exist independently from other rights that a consumer may have under other existing Federal law. Proposed § 205.33(f) contains guidance regarding the interplay between the error resolution provisions for remittance transfers and error resolution rights that may exist under other applicable consumer financial protection laws.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed § 205.33(f)(1) to implement the provision in EFTA section 919(e)(1) regarding the applicability of the remittance transfer error resolution provisions to EFTs. The proposed rule provided that if an alleged error in connection with a remittance transfer involved an incorrect EFT to a sender's account and the account was also held by the remittance transfer provider, then the requirements of proposed § 205.33, and its applicable time frames and procedures, governed the error resolution process. If the notice of error was asserted with an account-holding institution that was not the same entity as the remittance transfer provider, however, proposed § 205.33(f)(1) provided that the error resolution procedures under § 205.11 (currently § 1005.11), and not those under § 205.33, would apply to the account-holding institution's investigation of the alleged error.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>An electronic fund transfer from a consumer's account may also be a remittance transfer. But, as the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, an account-holding institution would likely be unable to identify a particular EFT as a remittance transfer unless it was also the remittance transfer provider. In the absence of direct knowledge that a particular EFT was used to fund a remittance transfer, the account-holding institution would face significant compliance risk if the error resolution requirements under proposed § 205.33 were deemed to apply to the error.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with the Board that such an outcome would be undesirable. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 205.33(f)(1) in renumbered § 1005.33(f)(1) to permit an account-holding institution to comply with the error resolution requirements of § 1005.11 when the institution is not also the remittance transfer provider for the transaction in question. In such a case, the sender will also have independent error resolution rights against the remittance transfer provider itself under § 1005.33.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters thought the proposed guidance was confusing and would apply more than one error resolution procedure to a remittance transfer provider. Although certain remittance transfer providers may have multiple error resolution obligations, these provisions are meant to resolve conflicts and provide greater certainty about which error resolution provisions apply in certain situations. Therefore, the Bureau is revising comment 33(f)-1 to provide such clarification.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Revised comment 33(f)-1 provides that a financial institution that is also the remittance transfer provider may have error obligations under both §§ 1005.11 and 1005.33. The comment provides examples to illustrate when certain error resolution procedures apply to a remittance transfer provider that is also the account-holding institution from which the transfer is funded. In the first example, a sender asserts an error under § 1005.11 with a remittance transfer provider that holds the sender's account, and the error is not also an error under § 1005.33, such as an omission of an EFT from a periodic statement. In this case, the error-resolution provisions of § 1005.11 exclusively apply to the error. In the second example, a sender asserts an error under § 1005.33 with a remittance transfer provider that holds the sender's account, and the error is also an error under § 1005.11, such as when the amount the sender requested to be deducted from the sender's account and sent for the remittance transfer differs from the amount that was actually deducted from the account and sent. In this case, the error-resolution provisions of § 1005.33 exclusively apply to the error.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(f)(2) addressed the scenario where the consumer provides a notice of error to the creditor that issued the credit card with respect to an alleged error involving an incorrect extension of credit in connection with a remittance transfer, such as when a consumer provides a credit card to pay for a remittance transfer. Proposed § 205.33(f)(2) provided that, in such a case, the error resolution provisions of Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.13, would apply to the creditor, rather than the requirements under proposed § 205.33. Proposed § 205.33(f)(2) also stated that if the sender instead provides a notice of error asserting an incorrect payment amount involving the use of a credit card to the remittance transfer provider, then the error resolution provisions of proposed § 205.33 would apply to the remittance transfer provider.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>A creditor of a credit card or other credit account may also act as a remittance transfer provider in certain circumstances, such as when a cardholder sends funds from his or her credit card through a service offered by the creditor to a recipient in a foreign country. In this case, an error could potentially be asserted under either Regulation Z or the error resolution provisions applicable to remittance transfers in the case of an incorrect extension of credit in connection with the transfer. The Board proposed that under these circumstances, the error resolution provisions under Regulation Z § 1026.13 would apply to the alleged error, but solicited comment on the proposed approach.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>One commenter suggested that if a remittance transfer provider is serving multiple roles, such as a creditor that is also a remittance transfer provider, the remittance transfer provider should have the ability to choose which error resolution procedure to follow. The Bureau does not believe that remittance transfer providers should be permitted to choose the error resolution procedure to apply because providers and senders would benefit from the application of consistent procedures in similar situations.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with the Board that it is reasonable to apply the Regulation Z error resolution provisions under circumstances where the remittance transfer provider is also the creditor because Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.13(d)(1) permits a consumer to withhold disputed amounts while an error is being investigated. However, the Bureau believes that the additional time afforded to a sender to assert an error under § 1005.33 may also be of value. Therefore, for a remittance transfer provider that is also the creditor, the Bureau is requiring that the time period to assert an error under § 1005.33(b) should apply instead of the time period under 12 CFR 1026.13(b). This will also ensure that the error resolution notice required under § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) is consistent. Otherwise, disclosing to a sender that the time period to assert an error may in some instances be 60 days from the periodic statement reflecting the error and in other instances may be 180 days from the disclosed date of availability on the remittance transfer receipt could be confusing.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also believes further clarification is warranted for errors other than incorrect extensions of credit in connection with the remittance transfer. For example, an error involving an incorrect amount of currency received under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) or the failure to make funds available by the disclosed date of availability under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) may be asserted as an error involving goods or services that have not been delivered as agreed under § 1026.13(a)(3). Accordingly, the Bureau is adding these references to the final rule to resolve any potential conflicts. The Bureau adopts § 205.33(f)(2) in renumbered § 1005.33(f)(2) with these revisions and amendments to clarify that the provision applies to all credit accounts rather than only credit card accounts.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau notes that in certain circumstances, a credit cardholder has a right to assert claims or defenses against a card issuer concerning property or services purchased with a credit card under Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.12(c)(1). These rights are independent of other billing error rights a cardholder may have. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 12(c)-1 to 12 CFR 1026.12(c). Therefore, the Bureau is adopting a new comment 33(f)-2 to clarify that to the extent a credit cardholder has a right to assert claims and defenses against a card issuer under 12 CFR 1026.12(c)(1), nothing in § 1005.33 limits a sender's right in this regard.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Board also proposed § 205.33(f)(3) to provide guidance where an alleged error involves an unauthorized EFT or unauthorized use of a credit card to send a remittance transfer, such as when a stolen debit or credit card is used to send funds to a foreign country. Specifically, proposed § 205.33(f)(3) clarified that the consumer would have rights under Regulation E §§ 1005.6 and 1005.11 in the case of an unauthorized EFT or Regulation Z §§ 1026.12(b) and 1026.13 in the case of an unauthorized use of a credit card. However, since the consumer holding the asset account or the credit card account is not the sender of the remittance transfer, proposed § 205.33(f)(3) stated that the error resolution provisions for remittance transfers would not apply. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 33(b)-1. The Bureau agrees with the Board's proposal, and § 205.33(f)(3) is adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(f)(3) with an amendment to clarify application of the provision to credit accounts generally as opposed to only credit card accounts.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters suggested that the reasoning the Board used in applying Regulation E §§ 1005.6 and 1005.11 in the case of an unauthorized EFT and Regulation Z §§ 1026.12(b) and 1026.13 in the case of an unauthorized use of a credit card, should be used in applying UCC Article 4A provisions to an unauthorized wire transfer. As discussed above in the supplementary information to § 1005.30(e), UCC Article 4A-108 provides that Article 4A does not apply “to a funds transfer, <em data-original="E-03">any part of which is governed by the [EFTA]”</em> (emphasis added). Furthermore, as discussed above, the Bureau may only preempt State law to the extent that there is an inconsistency. Since the Bureau does not believe there is an inconsistency between the EFTA and UCC Article 4A-108, UCC Article 4A does not apply to wire transfers that are remittance transfers under § 1005.30(e). Therefore, the Bureau declines to implement commenters' suggestion with respect to unauthorized wire transfers.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Board noted that in certain cases a consumer may be able to assert error resolution rights in connection with a remittance transfer with both the remittance transfer provider as well as the account-holding institution or credit card issuer or creditor. Proposed comment 33(f)-2 addressed this situation by providing that if a sender receives credit to correct an error of an incorrect amount paid in connection with a remittance transfer from either the remittance transfer provider or the sender's account-holding institution or creditor, and then subsequently asserts the same error with the other party, the other party would have no further responsibilities to investigate the error. The proposed comment also clarified that an account-holding institution or creditor may reverse amounts it has previously credited to correct an error if the consumer receives more than one credit to correct the same error and provided an example to illustrate this concept.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter noted that the provisions in § 1005.33(f) could provide a consumer with potentially different error resolution procedures depending on who the consumer decides to contact. This may be the case if the remittance transfer provider is not also the account-holding institution or creditor. However, proposed comment 33(f)-2 explains that the second party has no error resolution obligations if the sender already received credit to correct an error of an incorrect amount paid in connection with a remittance transfer. This comment makes clear that a consumer may not receive a windfall by successfully asserting an error with both the provider and the account-holding institution and/or credit card issuer or creditor.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Another industry commenter suggested that the remittance transfer provider should be permitted to delay providing a remedy until expiration of the card issuer's chargeback right under network rules to prevent duplicate recoveries when remittances are funded by a debit card or a credit card. The Bureau believes that the delay would be disadvantageous for senders in getting a speedy resolution to an error and that proposed comment 33(f)-2 is a better method for dealing with the possibility of duplicate recoveries. The Bureau adopts this comment, renumbered as comment 33(f)-3, substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Lastly, the Bureau received comment from an industry commenter questioning which error resolution provisions apply when a sender has multiple funding sources for the remittance transfer. For example, a sender could fund a remittance transfer partly by a balance in the sender's account held by the remittance transfer provider and partly by a credit card or an ACH transfer from the sender's checking account. In such cases, the Bureau notes that which error resolution procedure will apply depends on the error that is asserted. For example, if the error asserted is the incorrect extension of credit in connection with the remittance transfer, then § 1005.33(f)(2) provides that § 1026.13 applies to the creditor while § 1005.33 applies to the remittance transfer provider, but only with respect to the amount of the remittance transfer funded by the credit card. However, if the remittance transfer provider is also the creditor, only § 1026.13 applies to the remittance transfer provider with respect to the amount of the remittance transfer funded by the credit card.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Similarly, if the error asserted is an incorrect EFT from a sender's account, then § 1005.33(f)(1) provides that § 1005.11 applies to the account-holding institution while § 1005.33 applies to the remittance transfer provider, but only with respect to the amount of the remittance transfer funded by the debit card or the ACH transfer from the sender's account. However, if the remittance transfer provider is also the account-holding institution, only § 1005.33 applies to the remittance transfer provider with respect to the amount of the remittance transfer funded by the debit card or the ACH transfer from the sender's account. The Bureau believes the regulation and commentary as adopted provide sufficient guidance in this regard, and additional clarification is not necessary.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>33(e) Reassertion of Error</title>
            <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, under proposed § 205.33(e), a remittance transfer provider that has fully complied with the error resolution requirements with respect to a particular notice of error would have no further responsibilities in the event the sender later reasserts the same error, except in the case of an error asserted following the sender's receipt of information provided under § 1005.33(a)(1)(v). Furthermore, proposed comment 33(e)-1 explained that the remittance transfer provider would have no further error resolution responsibilities if the sender voluntarily withdraws the notice alleging an error. In such case, however, the sender would retain the right to reassert the allegation within the original 180-day period from the disclosed date of availability unless the remittance transfer provider had already complied with all of the error resolution requirements before the allegation was withdrawn. As noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the proposed provision and comment were modeled on similar provisions under § 1005.11(e). The Board requested comment on whether additional guidance is necessary regarding the circumstances in which a sender has “voluntarily withdrawn” a notice of error.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Commenters did not generally address proposed § 205.33(e) or proposed comment 33(e)-1. However, one industry commenter suggested that the error resolution process under proposed § 205.33 should be the exclusive remedy for the enumerated errors. EFTA section 916 provides that there is no civil liability for an error resolved in accordance with the error resolution procedures set forth in EFTA section 908, which are the error resolution procedures implemented in § 1005.11. The Bureau notes that EFTA section 916 was not amended to include the error resolution procedures for remittance transfers set forth in EFTA section 919(d). As such, under EFTA section 916, a court could find that there is civil liability even for an error that has been resolved in accordance with the error resolution procedures in § 1005.33. Accordingly, the Bureau adopts proposed § 205.33(e) as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(e) . The Bureau adopts comment 33(e)-1 with one change to include the time period relevant to an error asserted pursuant to § 1005.33(b)(2) after a sender receives requested documentation, additional information or clarification from the remittance transfer provider.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>33(d) Procedures if Remittance Transfer Provider Determines No Error or Different Error Occurred</title>
            <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed § 205.33(d) to establish procedures in the event that a remittance transfer provider determines that no error or a different error occurred from that described by the sender. Specifically, proposed § 205.33(d)(1) stated that the remittance transfer provider must provide a written explanation of the provider's finding that there was no error or that a different error occurred, consistent with EFTA section 919(d)(1)(B)(iv). Such explanation would have to respond to the sender's specific complaint and note the sender's right to request the documents that the provider relied on in making its determination. Furthermore, under proposed § 205.33(d)(2), the remittance transfer provider would be required to promptly provide copies of such documentation upon the sender's request.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Under proposed comment 33(d)-1, if a remittance transfer provider determined that an error occurred in a manner or amount different from that described by the sender, the provider would be required to comply with applicable provisions of both § 1005.33(c) and (d) (proposed as § 205.33(c) and (d)). Similar to comment 11(d)-1 with respect to error investigations involving EFTs, the provider may choose to give the notice of correction of error under § 1005.33(c)(1) (proposed as § 205.33(c)(1)) and the explanation that a different error occurred under § 1005.33(d) (proposed as § 205.33(d)) separately or in a combined form. The Bureau did not receive any comments on the procedures set forth in proposed § 205.33(d) or comment 33(d)-1. The Bureau adopts these provisions substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(d) and comment 33(d)-1.</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.30(a) stated that an “agent” means an agent, authorized delegate, or person affiliated with a remittance transfer provider under State or other applicable law, when such agent, authorized delegate, or affiliate acts for that remittance transfer provider. The final rule adopts the definition as proposed in renumbered § 1005.30(a).</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919 does not use consistent terminology concerning agents of remittance transfer providers. For example, EFTA section 919(f)(1) uses the phrase “agent, authorized delegate, or person affiliated with a remittance transfer provider,” when that person “acts for that remittance transfer provider,” while other provisions use the phrase “agent or authorized delegate” (EFTA section 919(f)(2)) or simply “agent” (EFTA section 919(b)). The Bureau does not believe that these statutory wording differences are intended to establish different standards across the rule. Therefore, the rule generally refers to “agents,” as defined in § 1005.30(a), to provide consistency across the rule.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Commenters suggested that the Bureau provide further clarity on the definition of “agent,” including clarifying that financial institutions' relationships with intermediary and correspondent institutions are not agency relationships unless an agreement creates such a relationship as a matter of law. The final rule does not contain these suggested clarifications. The Bureau believes that because the concept of agency has historically been defined by common law, it is appropriate for the definition to defer to applicable law regarding agents, including with respect to what creates or constitutes an agency relationship.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>30(b) Business Day</title>
            <analysisParagraph>Several provisions in the final rule use the term “business day.” <em data-original="E-03">See, e.g.,</em> §§ 1005.31(e)(2) and 1005.33(c)(1). Because the definition of “business day” in § 1005.2(d) of Regulation E applies only to financial institutions and includes inapt commentary, the Board proposed an alternative definition of “business day” applicable to remittance transfer providers. The proposed rule stated that “business day” means any day on which a remittance transfer provider accepts funds for sending remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Commenters generally objected to the proposed definition. In particular, financial institution commenters expressed concern that the date on which an institution “accepts funds” is unclear, because it could be interpreted either as the date on which funds are deposited into an account, or when the institution accepts a sender's order to transfer funds. Other commenters suggested replacing the proposed definition with a definition closer to the definition of “business day” in § 1005.2(d) Regulation E. Upon further review, and for greater consistency among definitions, the Bureau is adopting a revised “business day” definition in renumbered § 1005.30(b) as explained in related commentary that more closely tracks the general definition of “business day” in § 1005.2(d), but that is tailored to the particular aspects of remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Specifically, § 1005.30(b) states that “business day” means any day on which the offices of a remittance transfer provider are open to the public for carrying on substantially all business functions. Similar to proposed comment 30(b)-1, final comment 30(b)-1 clarifies that with respect to subpart B, a business day includes the entire 24-hour period ending at midnight, and a notice given under any section of subpart B is effective even if given outside of normal business hours. However, comment 30(b)-1 states that a remittance transfer provider is not required under subpart B to make telephone lines available on a 24-hour basis.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Comment 30(b)-2 explains that “substantially all business functions” include both the public and the back-office operations of the provider. For example, if the offices of a provider are open on Saturdays for customers to request remittance transfers, but not for performing internal functions (such as investigating errors), then Saturday is not a business day for that provider. In this case, Saturday does not count toward the business-day standard for subpart B for purposes of determining the number of days for resolving errors, processing refunds, etc.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Comment 30(b)-3 clarifies that a provider may determine, at its election, whether an abbreviated day is a business day. For example, if a provider engages in substantially all business functions until noon on Saturdays instead of its usual 3 p.m. closing, it may consider Saturday a business day. Finally, comment 30(b)-4 states that if a provider makes a telephone line available on Sundays for cancelling the transfer, but performs no other business functions, Sunday is not a business day under the “substantially all business functions” standard.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.33(h)(1) would have required that a remittance transfer provider be able to demonstrate that the sender provided an incorrect account number in connection with the remittance transfer.  The Bureau explained that it did not believe that this proposed condition represented a substantial change from the 2012 Final Rule, which incentivized providers to document whether the sender had provided inaccurate information in order to invoke the right to charge certain related fees in connection with a resent transaction. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) in the 2012 Final Rule.

Accordingly, proposed § 1005.33(h)(1) is adopted substantially as proposed, except that it is expanded to apply both to account numbers and recipient institution identifiers, as discussed above.  The comment is also revised to make clear that the provider must be able to demonstrate that the sender provided the incorrect account number or recipient institution identifier, language that was in proposed § 1005.33(h).</analysisParagraph>

              <title>33(h)(2)</title>
              <analysisParagraph>In the December Proposal, the Bureau noted that typically remittance transfer providers have no means to verify whether a sender provided account number for the designated recipient is accurate.  Thus, the Bureau did not propose, as a condition of the proposed exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D), that providers verify account numbers before sending a remittance transfer to an account.  However, and as noted above, the Bureau is expanding the exception to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) to include senders' mistakes regarding recipient institution identifiers, as well as mistakes regarding account numbers.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In response to the Bureau's request for comment on sender mistakes generally, some industry commenters acknowledged that, in some instances, institution identifier information provided by senders may be at least partially verifiable.  Foremost among these are BICs (sometimes referred to as SWIFT codes) and other recipient institution identifiers.  Commenters noted, however, that verification is neither ubiquitous nor perfect.  Several consumer group commenters argued, on the other hand, that the Bureau should not expand the exception to mistakes regarding recipient institution identifiers because remittance transfer providers should be able to verify such identifiers.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As a result of the Bureau's inclusion of recipient institution identifiers in the exception to the definition of error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D), the Bureau is adopting new § 1005.33(h)(2), which provides that for any instance in which the sender provided the incorrect recipient institution identifier, prior to or when sending the transfer, the provider used reasonably available means to verify that the recipient institution identifier provided by the sender corresponded to the recipient institution name provided by the sender.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As adopted, § 1005.33(h)(2) will permit remittance transfer providers to rely on the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) only in situations where no reasonable verification is possible or where reasonably available means were applied but were unable to prevent a mis-deposit that occurred because the sender provided an incorrect recipient institution identifier.  The exception does not apply to account number mistakes insofar as the Bureau continues to believe that no reasonable means to verify that an account number matches the name of the designated recipient disclosed to the sender exists today for most transfers. The Bureau will continue to monitor whether expansion of the condition is appropriate.  Furthermore, § 1005.33(h)(2) requires that the verification occur prior to or when the provider is sending the transfer because if the verification occurs later it may be too late to prevent a mis-deposit.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting new comment 33(h)-1, which explains that the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) applies only when a sender provides an incorrect recipient institution identifier, § 1005.33(h)(2) limits the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to situations where the provider used reasonably available means to verify that the recipient institution identifier provided by the sender did correspond to the recipient institution name provided by the sender.  Reasonably available means may include accessing a directory of Business Identifier Codes and verifying that the code provided by the sender matches the provided institution name, and, if possible, the specific branch or location provided by the sender.  Comment 33(h)-1 explains that providers may also rely on other commercially available databases or directories to check other recipient institution identifiers.  If reasonable verification means fail to identify that the recipient institution identifier is incorrect, the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) will apply, assuming that the provider can satisfy the other conditions in § 1005.33(h).  Similarly, if no reasonably available means exist to verify the accuracy of the recipient institution identifier, § 1005.33(h)(2) would be satisfied and thus the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) also will apply, again assuming the provider can satisfy the other conditions in § 1005.33(h).  However, where a provider does not employ reasonably available means to verify a recipient institution identifier, § 1005.33(h)(2) is not satisfied and the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) will not apply.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting this provision because upon further consideration, it concludes that if remittance transfer providers want to avail themselves of the exception to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) for mistakes regarding recipient institution identifiers, they must take reasonable steps to limit the occurrence of these mistakes.  The Bureau believes that, in many instances providers can and currently do verify the accuracy of some identifiers, and that in many other instances verification is not feasible.  For example, many providers require, and senders provide, BICs to identify recipient institutions.  Providers, or their third-party partners, typically have access to a directory in which they can match the BIC with the institution name (and possibly location), and the Bureau believes many providers (or their business partners) perform such verifications today.  The Bureau also recognizes, however, that some providers may not conduct such verification.  In other instances, precise verification that the sender has identified the proper institution may be challenging, particularly if a recipient institution has no BIC code or other type of identifier for which there is an internationally accessible directory, or if a sender has not given all the information about the recipient institution that may be reflected in a numerical identifier, such as the branch location.<footnote ref="10">See &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.swift.com/products_services/bic_and_iban_format_registration_bic_details.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
                The Bureau believes the requirement appropriately requires verification where such mechanisms are reasonable available.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau notes that it intends to monitor the availability of other means to verify account numbers and recipient institution identifiers and it may propose to revise § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) and (h)(2) and the related commentary if such means become reasonably available.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters were largely divided on whether the Bureau should provide specific form and content instructions for the required notice.  However, no commenter objected to the basic requirement of notice, and several commenters affirmatively agreed that notice would be beneficial.  Those commenters who preferred that the Bureau specify a specific form for the required notice, including several smaller depository institutions, argued that model language provided by the Bureau would ease their compliance burden, particularly if there were a safe harbor for its use.  Those commenters who preferred the flexibility of the proposed notice provisions argued that remittance transfer providers may already provide this sort of notice in a number of different forms.  To require, or encourage through a safe harbor, specific model language or a form, these commenters contended, would cause remittance transfer providers to incur additional compliance costs as they would be required to alter existing forms and practices to match whatever the Bureau has established.  In addition, these commenters argued, providers would need additional time to comply with this final rule if they were required to use specific language to provide the proposed notice.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Several consumer group commenters argued that the proposed notice should be provided in a clear and conspicuous manner and in the same language that the rest of the transfer is conducted.  These commenters urged the Bureau to adopt a notice that comports with the clarity and language requirements of similar disclosures in other consumer statutes.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau adopts proposed § 1005.33(h)(2) with three changes as § 1005.33(h)(3).  New § 1005.33(h)(3) provides as a condition of § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) exception, a requirement that the remittance transfer provider provided notice to the sender before the sender made payment for the remittance transfer that, in the event the sender provided an incorrect account number or recipient institution identifier, the sender could lose the transfer amount.  The provision also provides that for purposes of providing the § 1005.33(h)(3) notice, § 1005.31(a)(2) applies to this notice unless the notice is given at the same time as other disclosures required by subpart B for which information is permitted to be disclosed orally or via mobile application or text message, in which case this disclosure may be given in the same medium as the other disclosures</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>This provision reflects three changes from the December Proposal:  (1) Mention of recipient institution identifiers in light of the expanded scope of § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D); (2) clarification that the notice must be provided before the sender authorizes the remittance transfer; (3) clarification that this notice may be given orally if provided along with a prepayment disclosure provided orally in accordance with § 1005.31(a)(2).<footnote ref="11">Section 1005.31(a)(2) generally requires disclosures required by subpart B of Regulation E to be in writing.  The provision makes exceptions for pre-payment disclosures, which may be provided electronically.</footnote>
                The Bureau believes that the requirement that the notice be provided before authorization of the transfer is generally in accordance with how most providers currently provide notice today and thus should not be a significant change from existing practice. The 2013 Final Rule does not specify the form of such notice but the Bureau intends to monitor how providers implement this condition to determine whether additional specificity is appropriate.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that, pursuant to the revisions to § 1005.31(a)(1) discussed above, the notice provided pursuant to § 1005.33(h)(3), like all disclosures required by subpart B of Regulation E, in § 1005.33(h)(3) must be clear and conspicuous. <em data-original="E-03">See also</em> comment 33(a)(1)-1.

              <analysisParagraph>As explained in the December Proposal, the Bureau's goal is to ensure that senders are informed of the risks of a mistake.  Given that many remittance transfer providers are already providing notices of this risk through various means, the Bureau wants to ensure that the practice is adopted across the remainder of the industry while minimizing the need to change existing notices if they were already sufficient for the purposes of proposed § 1005.33(h)(2).  While the Bureau understands that providing model language might make compliance easier for some providers, the Bureau believes that there are sufficient models available in providers' existing materials that it is inappropriate to delay adoption of this condition while the Bureau designs and tests appropriate model language.</analysisParagraph>

              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received a number of comments from industry commenters and some consumer group commenters encouraging the Bureau to eliminate this proposed condition.  These commenters stated that even if funds are not deposited into another customer's account, other forms of improper routing due to erroneous information provided by a sender could cause transferred funds to be lost or, at the very least, delayed beyond the original date of availability.  Other consumer group commenters disagreed, however, asserting that, in their opinion, remittance transfer providers typically can retrieve funds that have been misrouted unless the funds are deposited into the wrong customer's account.  These consumer group commenters opined that so long as the funds remain in an institution's control, there is generally no concern that those funds will disappear.</analysisParagraph>

To the extent that commenters' concerns related to the delay of funds rather than their disappearance, as noted above, the Bureau declines to expand the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to cover delayed transfers rather than actual mis-deposited transfers.</analysisParagraph>

Whether a provider has used reasonable efforts does not depend on whether the provider is ultimately successful in recovering the amount that was to be received by the designated recipient.

The Bureau continues to believe that whether a particular provider's efforts are prompt depends on the facts and circumstances, for instance when the fact of an error is first identified.  In general, the Bureau believes a provider acts promptly where it acts before the date that the funds are expected to be made available to the recipient, but a provider may not have notice that there is a problem with the transfer that early.

            <title>33(h) Incorrect Account Number Provided by the Sender</title>
            <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.33(h) contained several conditions that a remittance transfer provider would have been required to satisfy in order to benefit from the proposed exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D).  Specifically, proposed § 1005.33(h)(1) through (4) would have provided four conditions, including:  That the provider be able to demonstrate that the sender did in fact provide an incorrect account number, that the provider gave the sender notice that if the sender provided an incorrect account number that the transfer could be lost, that the incorrect account number resulted a deposit of the transfer into the wrong account, and that the provider used reasonable efforts to attempt to retrieve the mis-deposited funds.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In response to proposed § 1005.33(h), many industry commenters sought more specificity in the conditions, especially with respect to the form of notice required to inform senders that the transfer amount could be lost, what would satisfy as a reasonable effort to retrieve lost funds, and the timeframe in which such efforts would be deemed prompt.  Other industry participants, however, supported the generality in the proposed conditions because the commenters believed that the conditions provided flexibility and accommodated existing practice.  In addition, some industry commenters expressed concern with the proposed condition that funds actually be mis-deposited into the wrong account for the proposed exception to apply.  These commenters argued that often it is difficult for remittance transfer providers to know whether funds have in fact been mis-deposited.  The Bureau has considered these comments and is finalizing the rule with five conditions in § 1005.33(h)(1) through (5), each of which is discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Generally speaking, the Bureau believes that the conditions set forth in § 1005.33(h) are consistent with industry best practices today and will provide further incentive to continue improving safeguards against mis-deposit over time.  Where a remittance transfer is deposited into the wrong account today, the Bureau believes that many, if not most, providers already attempt to recover the principal amount of the transfer.  However, because providers have reported that they often do not have direct relationships with receiving institutions, and that in some instances those institutions may be unresponsive to requests for assistance, providers may face difficulties in recovering funds from the wrong account.  The Bureau believes that, in many instances, to reverse these transactions requires the accountholder to authorize a debit from the account and, thus, the lack of this authority may prohibit a recipient institution from debiting the account in the amount of the incorrect deposit absent an authorization.  Relatedly, a provider in the United States may be able to do little to assist the foreign institution in its attempt to persuade its accountholder to provide debit authorization due to the lack of privity between the provider and the recipient institution or the accountholder.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Thus, the 2013 Final Rule strikes an appropriate balance by limiting the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to circumstances of actual mis-deposits and by requiring reasonable verification methods, without holding remittance transfer providers responsible for circumstances beyond their control.</analysisParagraph>

The definition tracks the definition in § 1005.2(k), but revises its applicability to “remittance transfers authorized in advance to recur at substantially regular intervals.” Similarly, the final rule adopts a new comment 30(d)-1 that tracks existing comment 2(k)-1, but with references to remittance transfers replacing references to EFTs.</analysisParagraph>

            <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.30(e) incorporated the definition of “remittance transfer provider” from EFTA section 919(g)(3). Proposed § 205.30(e) stated that a remittance transfer provider (or provider) means any person that provides remittance transfers for a consumer in the normal course of its business, regardless of whether the consumer holds an account with such person. To eliminate redundancy, the proposed rule revised statutory references to “any person or financial institution” to “any person,” because the term “person” under Regulation E includes financial institutions. Proposed comment 30(e)-1 clarified that an agent is not deemed to be a remittance transfer provider by merely providing remittance transfer services on behalf of the remittance transfer provider. The proposed regulation is adopted generally as proposed in renumbered § 1005.30(f). Comment 30(f)-1 is revised for clarity to state that a person is not deemed to be acting as a remittance transfer provider when it performs activities as an agent on behalf of a remittance transfer provider. New comments 30(f)-2 and -3 are added as described below. The Bureau notes that this comment 30(f)-1 applies only for purposes of this rule. In other contexts, a person may act as a provider when it performs activities on behalf of a provider.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>Normal Course of Business</title>
              <analysisParagraph>The Board solicited comment on whether guidance should be adopted interpreting the phrase “normal course of business” based on the number of remittance transfers in a given year. Many industry commenters argued that the final rule should provide for a <em data-original="E-03">de minimis</em> exception based on the number of remittance transfers sent in a given time period, although one credit union commenter stated that it could be difficult to track numbers. Suggestions ranged from 1,200 or fewer transfers annually to 2,400 transfers annually, per method (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> 2,400 wire transfers plus 2,400 international ACH transfers).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The commenters did not provide any data on the overall distribution and frequency of remittance transfers across various providers to support treating such high numbers of transactions as being outside the normal course of business. Nor did they suggest other means of determining when remittance transfer providers are engaging in transfers merely as an accommodation to occasional consumer requests rather than part of a business of payment services. Absent significant additional information, the Bureau is skeptical that Congress intended to exclude companies averaging 100 or more remittance transfer providers per month from the statutory scheme. Based on the data presented by commenters, such a range would appear to exclude the majority of providers of open network transfers, such as international wire transfers and ACH transactions, from the rule. For example, one trade association commenter stated that most respondents to an information request said that they make fewer than 2,400 international transactions per year. As discussed above, the Bureau believes that the statute clearly covers open network transfers, such as wire transfers and ACH transactions. Providing an exception based on the ranges suggested by these commenters would allow many financial institutions that arguably regularly and in the normal course of business provide remittance transfers to not be subject to the regulation. The Bureau believes in general that the term “normal course of business” covers remittance transfer activities at a level significantly lower than the ranges suggested by these commenters.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In other contexts, regulatory coverage is triggered by a relatively small number of transactions. For example, under Regulation Z, 12 CFR part 1026, a creditor is a person who regularly extends consumer credit under specified circumstances. A person regularly extends consumer credit when it extends consumer credit more than 25 times in the preceding calendar year or in the current year (and five times for transactions secured by a dwelling, or even one time for certain high-cost mortgages).<footnote ref="73">The Bureau notes that it has issued a separate notice of request for information in which the Bureau requests comment on whether it should revise these threshold numbers in Regulation Z. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 76 FR 75825 (Dec. 5, 2011).</footnote>
            <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 12 CFR 1026.2(a)(17). Under State law, a single money transmission may trigger a requirement to register as a money transmitter.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe it has sufficient information on the frequency with which entities engage in remittance transfers to set a specific numerical threshold based on the current administrative record. Accordingly, the final rule adopts a new comment 30(f)-2 addressing “normal course of business.” Comment 30(f)-2 states that whether a person provides remittance transfers in the normal course of business depends on the facts and circumstances, including the total number and frequency of remittance transfers sent by the provider. For example, if a financial institution generally does not make international consumer wire transfers available to customers, but sends a couple of international consumer wire transfers in a given year as an accommodation for a customer, the institution does not provide remittance transfers in the normal course of business. In contrast, if a financial institution makes international consumer wire transfers generally available to customers (whether described in the institution's deposit account agreement, or in practice) and makes transfers multiple times per month, the institution provides remittance transfers in the normal course of business.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>While the final comment does not include a numerical threshold for “normal course of business,” the Bureau recognizes that a bright-line number may ease compliance. Thus, in the January 2012 Proposed Rule, published elsewhere in the <em data-original="E-04">Federal Register</em> today, the Bureau is soliciting further comment on a potential safe harbor threshold.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>Multiple Remittance Transfer Providers</title>
              <analysisParagraph>New comment 30(f)-3 provides guidance where more than one remittance transfer provider is involved in providing a remittance transfer. The Bureau recognizes that in some situations more than one remittance transfer provider may be involved in providing a remittance transfer. For example, prepaid card programs may involve, among others: (i) A program sponsor that establishes the program relationships, identifies and procures the necessary parties and sets contractual terms and conditions; (ii) a program manager which functions as a day-to-day operations “control center” for the program; and (iii) an issuing bank whose contractual involvement is required to invoke the payment network and which also may serve as the holder of funds that have been prepaid and are awaiting instructions to be disbursed. Any and all of these entities may be a “remittance transfer provider” if they meet the definition as set forth in § 1005.30(f).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Comment 30(f)-3 provides that if the remittance transfer involves more than one remittance transfer provider, only one set of disclosures must be given, and the remittance transfer providers must agree among themselves which provider must take the actions necessary to comply with the requirements that subpart B imposes on any or all of them. Even though the providers must designate one provider to take the actions necessary to comply with the requirements that subpart B imposes on any or all of them, all remittance transfer providers involved in the remittance transfer remain responsible for compliance with the applicable provisions of the EFTA and Regulation E.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>30(g) Sender</title>
            <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.30(f) incorporated the definition of “sender” from EFTA section 919(g)(4) with minor edits for clarity. Specifically, proposed § 205.30(f) defined “sender” to mean “a consumer in a state who requests a remittance transfer provider to send a remittance transfer to a designated recipient.” The final rule adopts the definition largely as proposed in renumbered § 1005.30(g), with additional clarifications and a new explanatory comment.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Several commenters suggested that the Bureau limit remittance transfers to those sent for personal, family, or household purposes. Although Regulation E's applicability is generally limited to such consumer-purpose transactions, the limitation is contained in the definition of “account” in § 1005.2(b). However, the remittance transfer rule applies to more than just account-based transfers. As a result, these commenters stated that an individual who requests a transfer for business purposes could arguably be a “sender” under the rule.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>To address these concerns, the Bureau is revising the definition of “sender” in § 1005.30(g) to clarify that a sender is a consumer in a State who primarily for personal, family, or household purposes requests a remittance transfer provider to send a remittance transfer to a designated recipient. This revision is consistent with § 1005.2(b) and clarifies that the final rule does not apply to business-to-consumer or business-to-business transactions or to transactions that are not for personal, family or household purposes. For example, a transfer requested by a sole proprietor on behalf of his or her company would not be covered by the rule.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>As with the definition of “designated recipient,” some commenters requested guidance as to how they should determine whether a consumer is located in a State for account-based transfers. Commenters also requested clarification on how to determine where a consumer is located if the transfer request is made electronically or by telephone, and where the consumer's presence is not readily apparent. To address these questions, new comment 30(g)-1 clarifies that for transfers from an account, whether a consumer is located in a State depends on where the consumer's account is located. If the account is located in a State, the consumer will be located in a State for purposes of the definition of “sender” in § 1005.30(g), notwithstanding comment 3(a)-3. Where a transfer is requested electronically or by telephone and the transfer is not from an account, the provider may make the determination of whether a consumer is located in a State on information that is provided by the consumer and on any records associated with the consumer that it might have, such as an address provided by the consumer.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>One commenter asked the Bureau to clarify the application of Regulation E's comment 3(a)-3 to subpart B. Comment 3(a)-3 addresses the foreign applicability of Regulation E with respect to EFTs. The proposed definition of “sender” and the proposed commentary did not address how comment 3(a)-3 would apply with respect to remittance transfers that are EFTs, such as international ACH transfers from an account. The statutory definition of “sender,” and thus the definition in § 1005.30(g), does not turn on a consumer's residency; rather, the definition only requires that there be a consumer in a State requesting a remittance transfer. As with the definition of “designated recipient,” the Bureau believes that directing providers to look to the location of the account as a proxy for the location of the sender will create a bright line that will facilitate compliance with the final rule and ease compliance burden. Thus, as discussed above, under the final rule, for remittance transfers from an account, providers must look to the location of the account to determine whether there is a sender, and not the residency of the consumer requesting the transfer. Accordingly, final comment 30(g)-1 clarifies that the provider should make its determination notwithstanding comment 3(a)-3.</analysisParagraph>

Specifically, EFTA section 919(g)(3) defines a remittance transfer provider as “ <em data-original="E-03">any person</em> that provides remittance transfers for a consumer in the normal course of its business, whether or not the consumer holds an account with such person” (emphasis added). Thus, subpart B applies to non-financial institutions, such as non-bank money transmitters, that send remittance transfers. This revision is adopted as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>34(a) Sender Right of Cancellation and Refund</title>
            <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.34(a) stated that a remittance transfer provider must comply with a sender's oral or written request to cancel a remittance transfer received no later than one business day from when the sender makes payment in connection with the remittance transfer provider. In the proposal, the Board recognized that remittance transfers sent by ACH or wire transfer generally cannot be cancelled once the payment order has been accepted by the sending institution. <em data-original="E-03">See, e.g.,</em> UCC Article 4A-211 (providing that a payment order cannot be cancelled or amended once it has been accepted unless the receiving bank agrees or a funds-transfer system rule allows cancellation or amendment without agreement of the bank). The Board stated that it believed that under such circumstances, a bank or credit union making transfers by ACH or wire transfer would likely wait to execute the payment order until the cancellation period had passed, which could delay the receipt of the funds in the foreign country. The Board stated that one business day would provide a reasonable time frame for a sender to evaluate whether to cancel a remittance transfer after providing payment for the transfer, but requested comment regarding whether the proposed minimum time period should be longer or shorter than proposed.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters objected to the proposed cancellation right. One industry commenter believed a cancellation right was unnecessary for remittance transfers because fees incurred by the sender for a remittance transfer were minimal. A Federal Reserve Bank commenter argued that a cancellation right would give senders less incentive to provide accurate information. One industry commenter believed senders could use the cancellation right to take advantage of more favorable exchange rates. The industry commenter believed remittance transfer providers would increase exchange rates to compensate for the risk of loss.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Industry and trade group commenters agreed with the Board that the proposed cancellation period would delay processing routine remittance transfers because remittance transfers sent by ACH or wire transfer would likely be held until the cancellation period passed. Some industry commenters believed that the delay in processing would make it more difficult to determine an exchange rate. A member of Congress urged the Bureau to take into consideration senders' expectation for timely execution of remittance transfers in determining the appropriate cancellation period. A Federal Reserve Bank commenter believed a sender would want to remit funds as quickly as possible, and that the proposed cancellation right could cause senders to make payments using remittance mechanisms that are not subject to Regulation E.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters believed that the Bureau should require a one business day cancellation period, but suggested that the Bureau study when cancellations typically occur. These commenters suggested that a study could help the Bureau determine that decreasing the cancellation period could adequately protect senders. Many industry commenters believed that if the Bureau required a cancellation period, the period should be shorter than one business day. The commenters suggested a variety of shorter cancellation periods that could be more appropriate. Some industry commenters believed the cancellation period should be shortened to the same day or an hour. Several industry commenters believed the right to cancel should end when the remittance transfer provider executes the payment instruction. Several industry commenters believed the cancellation period should be shortened to 30 minutes, noting that this time period would be consistent with Texas law.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters suggested that institutions sending remittance transfers through ACH or wire transfer should be exempt from the cancellation rules. Other industry commenters suggested that a sender should have the right to opt out of the cancellation right to have the transfer sent immediately. Another industry commenter suggested that the provider should only be required to cancel if the provider has a reasonable opportunity to act upon the request. One industry commenter believed a right to refund remittance transfers that are unclaimed was a more appropriate cancellation policy. An industry commenter believed the provider should not be required to honor cancellation requests that are made for fraudulent purposes.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Other industry commenters believed the cancellation rules should be disclosure-based. One industry commenter believed that instead of a cancellation right, the provider should disclose that once a sender signs the remittance transaction agreement, it cannot be cancelled and that a failure to carry out a sender's cancellation request once a remittance agreement has been signed is not an error. Another industry commenter believed that if a provider had a cancellation policy, that the Bureau should require that it be properly disclosed.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that a cancellation right could be helpful to senders of remittance transfers. The Bureau also believes, however, that providers sending remittance transfers through ACH or wire transfer likely will delay transactions for the length of the cancellation period because such transfers are often difficult to retract once they are sent. A cancellation period of one business day thus could prevent a sender from sending a remittance transfer quickly. In addition, a long cancellation period could create an unfair competitive advantage for closed network money transmitters, who are less likely to delay sending a remittance transfer until the end of the cancellation period. Therefore, the Bureau believes a cancellation period shorter than one business day is appropriate.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The final rule requires a 30-minute cancellation period.<footnote ref="83">The 30-minute cancellation period is the same time period as the remittance transfer cancellation period under Texas law. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; TX Admin. Code § 278.052, which provides that a consumer may cancel a transfer for any reason within 30 minutes of initiating the transfer provided the customer has not left the premises. Unlike the Texas law, under § 1005.34(a), a sender may cancel within 30 minutes, regardless of whether the sender has left the premises.</footnote>
              A 30-minute cancellation period provides the sender the opportunity to review both the pre-payment disclosure and the receipt to ensure that the transfer was sent as the sender intended. However, the 30-minute cancellation period should not substantially delay transactions for senders who want to send funds quickly. The Bureau notes that 30 minutes is the minimum time that a provider must allow senders to cancel transactions, but providers may choose to permit senders to cancel transactions after the 30 minute period has passed. Moreover, even after the cancellation period has passed, senders may still assert their rights under § 1005.33 and obtain a refund or other remedy for transactions where an error occurred.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the final rule sets forth new cancellation requirements in a new § 1005.36 with respect to certain remittance transfers that a sender schedules in advance, including preauthorized remittance transfers. As discussed below, the Bureau believes that when a sender schedules a remittance transfer more than three days in advance of when the remittance transfer is made, a cancellation period tied to when the transfer is made, rather than when the transfer is authorized, is more beneficial to a sender. In those circumstances, the Bureau believes a sender should have the flexibility to cancel the transfer more than 30 minutes after scheduling the transfer to be made, given the potentially significant delay between when the sender authorizes the remittance transfer and when the sender schedules the remittance transfer to be made. Circumstances could change in the intervening period that would negate the purpose of the transfer. At the same time, allowing the sender to cancel certain remittance transfers that a sender schedules in advance for up to 30 minutes after the transfer is made could be burdensome to both senders and providers. A sender may not know the precise time of day that the transfer is scheduled, and such a rule would extend the period of uncertainty for providers, who may delay a transfer until the cancellation period has expired. Consequently, the 30-minute cancellation period described in § 1005.34(a) does not apply to remittance transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, and a remittance transfer provider must instead comply with the cancellation requirements in § 1005.36(c).</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.34(a) of the final rule provides that, except as provided in § 1005.36(c), a remittance transfer provider shall comply with the requirements of § 1005.34 with respect to any oral or written request to cancel a remittance transfer from the sender that is received by the provider no later than 30 minutes after the sender makes payment in connection with the remittance transfer, if the following two conditions are met.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>First, under proposed § 205.34(a)(1), a valid request to cancel a remittance transfer must enable the provider to identify the sender's name and address or telephone number and the particular transfer to be cancelled. Proposed comment 34(a)-1 clarified that the request to cancel a remittance transfer is valid so long as the remittance transfer provider is able to identify the remittance transfer in question. For example, the sender could provide the confirmation number or code that would be used by the designated recipient to pick up the transfer, or other identification number or code supplied by the provider in connection with the transfer. The proposed comment also permitted the provider to request, or the sender to provide, the sender's email address instead of a physical address, so long as the provider can identify the transfer to which the cancellation request applies.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Second, proposed § 205.34(a)(2) provided that a sender's timely request to cancel a remittance transfer is effective so long as the transferred funds have not been picked up by the designated recipient or deposited into an account held by the recipient.<footnote ref="84">As discussed in the proposal, such accounts need not be accounts held by a financial institution so long as the recipient may access the transferred funds without any restrictions regarding the use of such funds. For example, some Internet-based providers may track consumer funds in a virtual account or wallet and permit the holder of the account or wallet to make purchases or withdraw funds once funds are credited to the account or wallet.</footnote>
              Proposed comment 34(a)-2 reiterated that a remittance transfer provider must include an abbreviated notice of the sender's right to cancel a remittance transfer in the receipt or combined notice, as applicable. In addition, the proposed comment clarified that the remittance transfer provider must make available to a sender upon request, a notice providing a full description of the right to cancel a remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comment on the two conditions on the right to cancel. The final rule adopts the two conditions as proposed in renumbered § 1005.34(a)(1) and (a)(2). In addition, the Bureau adopts comments 34(a)-1 and 34(a)-2 substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adding comment 34(a)-3 to explain how a remittance transfer provider could comply with the cancellation and refund requirements of § 1005.34 if the cancellation request is received by the provider no later than 30 minutes after the sender makes payment. The comment states that a provider may, at its option, provide a longer time period for cancellation. The comment clarifies that a provider must provide the 30-minute cancellation right regardless of the provider's normal business hours. For example, if an agent closes less than 30 minutes after the sender makes payment, the provider could opt to take cancellation requests through the telephone number disclosed on the receipt. The provider could also set a cutoff time after which the provider will not accept requests to send a remittance transfer. For example, a financial institution that closes at 5:00 p.m. could stop accepting payment for remittance transfers after 4:30 p.m.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter believed that the Bureau should require a sender to contact the remittance transfer provider directly in order to cancel a transaction. The commenter believed that agents should not be required to handle cancellation requests, noting that under certain State laws, the agent does not have a right to the funds paid for a remittance transfer and therefore could not make a refund.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that a sender's cancellation request should be valid if the sender contacts the agent. Many participants in consumer testing indicated that they would contact an agent first if they encountered a problem with their remittance transfer. The Bureau also believes that requiring a sender to contact a remittance transfer provider by, for example, calling the telephone number listed on the receipt could frustrate the sender's ability to cancel within the 30-minute cancellation period. Consequently, the Bureau clarifies in comment 34(a)-4 that a cancellation request provided by a sender to an agent of the remittance transfer provider is deemed to be received by the provider under § 1005.34(a) when received by the agent. The Bureau understands, however, that an agent may not be able to provide a sender with the refund for legal or operational reasons, and, as discussed below, the final rule does not require an agent to provide a refund if the agent is unable to do so.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau is adding a comment to clarify when a sender makes a payment for a remittance transfer, for purposes of determining when the 30-minute cancellation period has passed. Comment 34(a)-5 clarifies that, for purposes of subpart B, payment is made, for example, when a sender provides cash to the remittance transfer provider or when payment is authorized.</analysisParagraph>

        <analysisSection target="1005-33-a-1-iv-D" notice="2013-10604" date="2013-10-28">
                <title>33(a)(1)(iv)(D)</title>
                <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) of the 2012 Final Rule defines as an error a remittance transfer provider's failure to make funds available to the designated recipient by the date of availability stated on the receipt or combined disclosure, subject to three listed exceptions, including an exception for remittance transfers made with fraudulent intent by the sender or a person working in concert with the sender. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C).  Comment 33(a)-5 to the 2012 Final Rule elaborates on the definition of the term “error” under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) and explains that such errors under subpart B of Regulation E include, among other things, the late delivery of funds, the total non-delivery of a remittance transfer, and the delivery of funds to the wrong account. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comments 33(a)-5.1 and .ii.  The commentary further notes that if only a portion of the funds are made available by the disclosed date of availability, then § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) does not apply, but § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) may apply instead.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>As explained under comment 33(c)-2 in the 2012 Final Rule, an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) would include situations where a remittance transfer provider failed to make funds in connection with a remittance transfer available to a designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability because the sender provided an incorrect account number to the remittance transfer provider.  After issuance of the 2012 Final Rule, the Bureau received comments from industry that providers often have no means to verify designated recipients' account numbers for remittance transfers into foreign bank accounts.  As a result, providers could have to bear the potentially significant costs of their customers' mistakes in cases in which funds were deposited in the wrong account and could not be recovered as a result of the sender's provision of an incorrect account number.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>In the December Proposal, the Bureau proposed to revise the definition of error in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) by adding a fourth, conditional exception.  Proposed § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) would have excluded from the definition of error a failure to make funds available to the designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability, where such failure resulted from the sender having given the remittance transfer provider an incorrect account number, provided that the provider met the conditions set forth in proposed § 1005.33(h).  These proposed conditions, would have required providers to notify senders of the risk that their funds could be lost, to investigate reported errors, and to attempt to recover the missing funds.  In addition, the exception would have been limited to situations in which the funds were actually deposited into the wrong account.  Where these conditions were met, the proposed exception would not have required providers to bear the cost of refunding or resending transfers.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisParagraph>The Bureau sought comment on the proposed exception generally and whether it should be limited to mistakes regarding account numbers or expanded to include other incorrect information provided by senders in connection with remittance transfers, such as routing numbers.  Each of these is discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
                <analysisSection>
                  <title>Exception for Senders' Mistakes Regarding Account Numbers</title>
                  <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters uniformly supported the addition of the proposed exception to the definition of error where the error was caused by the sender's provision of an incorrect account number.  They put forth a number of reasons why they favored the proposed change.  In many respects, these comments expanded upon those received prior to the December Proposal.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters reiterated earlier concerns about the large potential exposure given their general inability of remittance transfer providers to validate the accuracy of a designated recipient's account number provided in connection with a wire transfers and similar types of open network transfers sent to accounts at banks and other institutions abroad.  These commenters argued that providers sending these transfers over open networks generally have limited ability to cross-check account numbers with the names of accountholders prior to sending transfers because they often have no direct relationships with recipient institutions and thus no means of accessing those institutions' account information.  Commenters further stated that as a result, the only way for a provider to validate such numbers may be to contact the recipient institution manually, which may be time-consuming and difficult due to language and time zone issues.  Such validation would necessitate manual handling of remittance transfers and limit the ability of providers to use automated systems, which are less costly than manual handling of each transfer.  Commenters stated their concern that manual validation could substantially increase costs to senders and delay the processing of remittance transfers.  Relatedly, several commenters claimed that it was infeasible to expect providers to develop account number verification systems, automated or otherwise, before the effective date of the 2012 Final Rule (which was scheduled to take effect on February 7, 2013) due to the number of institutions worldwide that would need to adjust their systems used for transmitting wires.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters also reiterated concerns expressed prior to the issuance of the December Proposal regarding the potential for fraud if a sender's provision of an incorrect account number is considered an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv).  As discussed in the December Proposal, commenters had stated that the 2012 Final Rule could enable fraudulent activity to flourish because, if unscrupulous senders provided incorrect account numbers and funds were sent to a coconspirator, remittance transfer providers might have to send transfer amounts again to another coconspirator without first recovering them.  Commenters argued that the fraud exception in the 2012 Final Rule—§ 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C)—is insufficient because for providers to use the exception would be difficult in most circumstances.  Many industry commenters stated that providers in the United States typically have a limited ability to gather evidence of fraud from a recipient institution abroad or to mandate cooperation from foreign institutions with whom they have no direct relationship.  Industry commenters also noted that even if a provider suspected fraud, the lack of evidence would cause providers to hesitate to accuse one of its own customers of fraud.  Industry commenters also stated that the 2012 Final Rule departed from current industry practice by requiring that remittance transfer providers resend or refund a remittance transfer even when a sender's mistake results in mis-delivery of funds that cannot be recovered.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters expressed concern that in light of the significant exposure under the 2012 Final Rule's sender error provisions, if the Bureau did not revise the error resolution procedures as it proposed to do in the December Proposal, many remittance transfer providers would curtail their remittance transfer offerings such as by limiting the amount permitted per transfer, limiting transfers to certain trusted customers, or by exiting the remittance transfer business altogether.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters also argued that the Bureau should not have adopted the approach taken in the 2012 Final Rule to sender error because it was not mandated by statute.  One of these commenters opined that because the Dodd-Frank Act was not specific with respect to who must bear the cost of a mis-directed remittance transfer, the Bureau's legal authority to require remittance transfer providers to bear the cost of mistakes made by senders was questionable.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>In contrast to comments from industry, consumer group commenters were divided on whether the Bureau should adopt the proposed exception for certain sender errors.  Two consumer groups supported the proposed change because, they contended, the proposed rule achieved the appropriate allocation of risk between senders and remittance transfer providers and incentivized providers to minimize the occurrence of errors.  These commenters also stated that it would be difficult for providers, particularly small providers, to retrieve funds sent to the wrong account.  They further asserted that it would be difficult for providers, and particularly credit unions, to accuse their customers or members of fraud in order to avail themselves of the fraud exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C).  As a result, these consumer group commenters argued that absent the proposed revision, many providers might choose to exit the remittance transfer business altogether, resulting in a loss of access to senders.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Other consumer groups opposed the proposed changes and urged the Bureau not to amend the 2012 Final Rule with respect to sender mistakes regarding account numbers that result in the loss of the transfer amount.  First, some of these groups argued that the Bureau would be undermining the intent of Congress, which, they argued, was to motivate industry to change existing practices to develop more secure means of sending remittance transfers.  By adopting the proposed exception, these commenters argued, the Bureau would eliminate any incentive for remittance transfer providers to develop enhanced security procedures.  Relatedly, some consumer groups also argued that the existing definition of error in subpart A of Regulation E, specifically § 1005.11(a)(ii), already addresses the situation in which a consumer provides an incorrect recipient account number by creating an error for “incorrect” electronic fund transfers.<footnote ref="8">Section 1005.11 of subpart A of Regulation E contains error resolution provisions for electronic fund transfers.  Section 1005.11(a)(ii) states that a potential error under the rule is an “incorrect electronic fund transfer to or from the consumer's account.”</footnote>
                    These commenters noted that insofar as § 1005.11(a)(ii) is phrased in general terms and refers to an “incorrect electronic fund transfer” by its plain language it does not exclude incorrect information provided by a consumer (or any other party).  Insofar as § 1005.11(a)(ii) has long applied to a portion of remittance transfers, the commenters contended that had Congress intended to deny the protections of this provision to consumers, it would have done so more explicitly.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Finally, some consumer group commenters suggested that the Bureau should not adopt the proposed exception to the definition of error, even if the 2012 Final Rule would result in some remittance transfer providers exiting the market because they are unable to implement adequate verification procedures today.  Alternatively, these commenters suggested that, in order to reduce the risk of market exit, that the Bureau could adopt the proposed revisions, but limit the proposed exception to the definition of error to transfers over a certain dollar amount so that senders of smaller transfers would still benefit from the error provisions in the 2012 Final Rule.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Upon consideration of these comments and further consideration and to facilitate compliance, the Bureau is finalizing § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) with several changes from the proposed provision, which are discussed below.  As in the December Proposal, the exception as finalized will only apply if a remittance transfer provider can meet certain conditions including warnings to senders and use of reasonable validation methods where available.  These conditions are set forth in § 1005.33(h) and also are discussed in detail below.  Where the exception applies, providers will not be required to bear the cost of refunding or resending transfers if funds ultimately cannot be recovered.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>As it noted in the December Proposal, the Bureau believes that this exception appropriately allocates risk based on remittance transfer providers' existing methods for sending transfers, which often do not allow for or facilitate verification of designated recipients' account numbers.  The Bureau continues to believe it is important for industry to develop improved security procedures and expects to engage in a dialogue with industry about how to encourage the growth of improved controls and communication mechanisms.  But the Bureau understands that industry is unlikely to be reasonably able to implement such changes in the near future.  Subpart B of Regulation E does not regulate most recipient institutions, and the Bureau has concluded that individual providers, and particularly those sending transfers through open networks have limited ability to influence the practices of financial institutions worldwide in the short term.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Absent such changes, the Bureau is concerned that remittance transfer providers will exit the market or reduce remittance offerings rather than risk having to bear the cost of the entire transfer amount where funds are deposited into the wrong  account due to the sender's provision of an incorrect account number.  The Bureau believes such an interim disruption would not be in consumers' best interests, and thus has finalized the proposed exception as discussed below.  The Bureau, however, will continue to evaluate the development of procedures as it monitors providers' implementation of and compliance with the 2013 Final Rule.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau disagrees with those consumer group commenters that the 2012 Final Rule should be allowed to take effect absent the proposed exception for sender account number mistakes, and that the Bureau should instead monitor whether the concerns summarized in the December Proposal—such as increased fraud and remittance transfer providers exiting the market—actually materialize.  As stated above and in the December Proposal, the Bureau is concerned that absent the proposed change, some providers would severely curtail their offerings or withdraw from the remittance transfer business altogether, and such a market change could have a negative impact on senders.  The Bureau also does not believe, as commenters suggested, that it is appropriate to limit the scope of the exception to larger value transfers, because doing so could potentially encourage providers to limit senders' access to smaller value transfers.  In addition, the Bureau does not believe it appropriate to engage in line drawing or to provide differential protections in this circumstance.  Furthermore, the Bureau disagrees that the proposed exception would harm senders in that the exception in many ways maintains the status quo insofar as the Bureau believes that, today, senders typically bear the loss when their mistake leads to a mis-deposit.  Nor does the Bureau believe that the problem of senders losing the transfer amount is particularly widespread today; insofar as the status quo is maintained, the Bureau does not expect this to change.  The Bureau's outreach confirmed that in most cases where there is a problem in the transmission of a remittance transfer, the provider is able to retrieve the funds or have them routed properly.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>With regard to commenters' arguments about the Bureau's statutory authority, the Bureau disagrees both with industry participant and consumer group arguments that the EFTA or section 1073 of the Dodd-Frank Act specifies which party must bear the cost of a sender's mistake with respect to remittance transfer.  Rather, EFTA section 919 gives the Bureau broad discretion to set standards for remittance transfer providers with respect to error resolution, including to define errors, and does not mandate a specific result with regard to which party should bear the risk of loss under any particular circumstances.  Nor does the Bureau believe that the definition of error in subpart A of Regulation E, which does not apply to all remittance transfers, precludes the Bureau from adopting more specifically tailored error resolutions, and corresponding definitions, applicable to all remittance transfers under subpart B of Regulation E. <em data-original="E-03">See also</em> § 1005.33(f).  Accordingly, the Bureau has adopted the proposed exception for sender account number mistakes subject to specific conditions discussed below.</analysisParagraph>

                <analysisSection>
                  <title>The Scope of the Sender Error Exception</title>
                  <analysisParagraph>As noted above the Bureau also sought comment on the scope of the proposed exception to the definition of error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) and whether it should apply to incorrect information provided by senders in addition to designated recipients' account numbers and, in particular, whether the proposed exception should apply in cases in which senders make mistakes regarding routing numbers or similar institution identifiers in addition to mistakes regarding account numbers.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>In response, many industry commenters suggested that the proposed exception be expanded to refer to sender mistakes regarding any information provided by a sender in connection with a remittance transfer rather than just mistaken account numbers, as proposed.  Other commenters listed specific types of incorrect information that should be addressed by the exception to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv), such as:  Routing numbers, Business Identifier Codes (BICs), Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication codes (SWIFT codes), International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs), local bank codes, prepaid, debit or credit card account numbers, recipient institutions' names, designated recipients' names, escrow account numbers, currencies in which transfers will be received, incomplete wire instructions, and recipients' email addresses, phone numbers, and addresses.  Commenters offered different reasons as to why the proposed exception should be expanded to include sender mistakes regarding each suggested type of information.  In addition to considering these comments, the Bureau conducted additional outreach to understand the nature of errors related to the suggested types of information and why remittance transfer providers thought they should be included in any exception to an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) in the 2012 Final Rule.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Many of the industry commenters that urged that the proposed exception should be extended to all mistakes made by senders argued, as noted above, that there is no statutory basis to make remittance transfer providers bear the cost of all senders' mistakes.  Relatedly, one commenter argued that no other consumer finance statute protects consumers from their own errors and that there is a distinction between allocating risk to a provider for mistakes by third parties, or where fault cannot be determined, and requiring providers to bear the cost of senders' mistakes.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>As for the specific types of information provided by senders, nearly all industry commenters and some consumer group commenters favored expanding the proposed exception to apply to sender mistakes regarding routing numbers and other recipient institution identifiers.  Commenters explained that for many remittance transfers into accounts, remittance transfer providers request, in addition to the number of the designated recipient's account, an alphanumeric identifier of the recipient institution, similar to the routing numbers used to identify depository institutions in the United States.<footnote ref="9">For example, in order to route a wire transfer to a foreign bank, a bank in the United States may require that the sender provide the name of the designated recipient and the recipient's institution as well as the BIC for the recipient's institution, and the recipient's account number.</footnote>
                    Providers, and any other intermediaries involved in the transfer, then use this identifier to determine the institution to which the transfer should be sent.  Commenters further explained that, in many cases, a sender's mistake regarding the identifier of a bank could pose a similar problem for a provider as an incorrect account number.  The commenters stated that, like account numbers, many providers lack the ability to verify the accuracy of alphanumerical identifiers related to recipient institutions that are provided by senders.  If a recipient institution identifier is incorrect and the provider does not match it with an institution name, funds could conceivably be mis-deposited if the institution represented by the incorrect routing number has an account matching the number provided by the sender.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>In addition to sender  mistakes regarding account numbers and recipient institution identifiers, several commenters asked that the Bureau exclude from the definition of error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) senders' mistakes regarding correspondent routing instructions (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> if the sender suggests that the remittance transfer provider send the transfer through a particular correspondent that is unable to complete the transfer).  Several commenters stated that generally this sort of mistake generally would lead to a delay of a transfer and not its mis-deposit into the wrong account.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Finally, several industry commenters argued that the proposed exception should be expanded to apply to senders' mistakes regarding designated recipients' names and information that the designated recipient themselves might need to apply the proceeds of remittance transfers after receipt.  For example, a trade association commenter asked that the Bureau expand the proposed exception to include sender mistakes about additional information a designated recipient needs to process a transfer it receives.  The commenter stated that if, for example, the designated recipient is an insurer, it might need the designated recipient's policy number to process the funds received.  Similarly, one commenter stated that if a designated recipient is a property lessor, the lessor might need an identifying apartment number in order to process a transfer that is a rent payment.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>After careful consideration of the comments received and upon further consideration, the Bureau is expanding the exception to the definition of error in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to include situations where a sender has provided an incorrect recipient institution identifier in addition to situations where a sender provides an incorrect account number, as long as the error results in a mis-deposit of the funds and that the remittance transfer provider meets the conditions set forth in § 1005.33(h).  As discussed below, the 2013 Final Rule includes as one such condition, that the provider use reasonably available means to verify the recipient institution identifier provided by the sender. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(h)(2).</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Based on its monitoring of the remittance market, review of comment letters, and other outreach, the Bureau believes that situations in which an incorrect recipient institution identifier could result in a transfer being deposited into the wrong account are exceedingly rare but not unheard of.  More typically, the Bureau understands, a mistaken identifier will result in a transfer that is returned to the remittance transfer provider because either the identifier does not match any institution or the account number does not match an account at the institution to which the transfer is mistakenly directed.  Nevertheless, the Bureau is expanding the exception in the 2013 Final Rule beyond what was proposed because, upon further consideration, it believes that it is appropriate to treat mistakes in recipient institution identifiers similarly to mistakes in account numbers.  The two types of identifiers are similar in purpose and, in some cases, are combined into one.  In addition, these identifiers may not be easily verifiable by providers sending remittance transfers over an open network and are used in straight-through, automated processing of transfers.  Additionally, although less likely than as with respect to account numbers, under the 2012 Final Rule an unscrupulous sender could potentially provide an incorrect routing number to perpetrate a fraud with a coconspirator abroad.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Contrary to requests by commenters that the Bureau extend the proposed exception for sender mistakes regarding account numbers to mistakes regarding all types of information, the Bureau is limiting the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to sender mistakes regarding account numbers and recipient institution identifiers because it does not believe it is appropriate to extend the exception to all mistakes a sender might make in connection with a remittance transfer for several reasons.  While the chance of mis-deposit is limited for all sender mistakes, the Bureau believes there is a greater risk for mistakes regarding account numbers and recipient institution identifiers.  However, for most other types of sender mistakes identified by commenters, such as mistakes regarding the recipient's address or wire instructions, the Bureau does not believe that the incorrect information would usually result in a mis-deposit of a remittance transfer.  Instead, the Bureau believes that these mistakes will at most result in a delay of delivery or in non-delivery of the remittance transfer.  In situations where the recipient institution identifies a customer with the same name as the designated recipient but is unable to match that customer's name to the provided account number, the Bureau believes that the recipient institution will generally be unable to apply the funds and that the transfer will be returned or otherwise delayed but that the funds will not be mis-deposited.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe that it is warranted to extend the exception to those sender mistakes that are likely to result only in either a delay or a return of the transfer to the remittance transfer provider, and not the loss of funds, because the cost to the provider of delay or non-delivery differs markedly from the cost of lost transfers.  Under the 2012 Final Rule, when a transfer is delayed or returned to the provider, the provider must refund its fee to the sender. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii).  Additionally, when the transfer is returned to the provider, the sender can request that the transfer be resent at no charge (although third-party fees may be imposed on the resend) or have the transfer amount refunded. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii).  The cost to the provider in these circumstances differs markedly from the cost to the provider under the 2012 Final Rule for a transfer that is mis-deposited into the wrong account and cannot be retrieved.  When a mis-deposit occurs, absent an exception, the provider may have to resend or refund the entire transfer amount if the transfer could not be retrieved from the wrong account rather than merely refund its fee or send a transfer at no cost. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii) and comment 33(c)-2 in the 2012 Final Rule.  Thus, for mis-deposited transfers, the fact that the provider is potentially at risk of having to absorb a loss of principal is far higher than for other types of errors and thus is far more likely to lead to a significant curtailment of services.  Furthermore, the Bureau believes that, in many respects, the remedy under the 2012 Final Rule for non-delivery is similar to many providers' existing practices in that they now resend funds at no charge with the corrected information.  Therefore, to maintain as an error sender mistakes that merely result in delay or non-delivery of the remittance transfer as part of this final rule would not require a significant adjustment for those providers.  Finally, the 2012 Final Rule already allows providers a mechanism to manage uncertainty regarding the date of delivery of funds. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) and comment 32(b)(2)-1 (interpreting § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) to allow a provider to disclose the “latest date on which funds will be available”).</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters suggested that the Bureau should make senders, rather than providers, bear the costs of their own mistakes because no other consumer protection regimes makes the regulated entities bear the costs of consumers' mistakes.  The Bureau does not think it is necessary or appropriate that the remittances rules' remedy provisions match perfectly those in other consumer protection regimes, given the unique statutory structure and nature of the transactions at issue.  The Bureau is maintaining the 2012 Final Rule's error provisions regarding sender mistakes other than those covered by the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D), because it believes providers are generally in the best position to institute systems to limit their occurrence and to work with other industry participants to resolve particular mistakes in transmissions.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>With respect to those mistakes that are likely to result only in a delay or non-delivery of a remittance transfer (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> mistakes other than those regarding account number or the recipient institution identifier), the Bureau believes that retaining the current rule, which does not include an exception for such mistakes, strikes the appropriate balance been protecting senders and encouraging providers to limit the incidence of such errors without exposing providers to the risk of loss of the transfer amount.  With respect to those sender mistakes that make it impossible for the recipient (as opposed to the recipient institution) to know how to use the funds received (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> an apartment number to apply a rent payment), the Bureau does not believe that such mistakes would give rise to an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv).  This is true because the 2013 Final Rule only does not define as an error the inability of the designated recipient to timely apply the funds for a particular purpose once a transfer is received.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also does not believe that a sender's provision of an incorrect name would result in an error under the 2013 Final Rule, and thus a sender's provision of an incorrect name need not be included in the exception from the term error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D).  As defined under § 1005.30(c), a designated recipient is “any person specified by the sender as the authorized recipient of a remittance transfer to be received at a foreign country.”  As noted above, comment 30(c)-1 in the 2012 Final Rule stated that a designated recipient can be either a natural person or an organization, such as a corporation.  The Bureau is further clarifying this comment in the 2013 Final Rule to explain that the designated recipient is identified by the name of the person provided by the sender to the remittance transfer provider and disclosed by the provider to the sender pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(iii). <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 30(c)-1.  Thus, assume for example that a sender tells a remittance transfer provider to send a transfer to “Jane Doe” at a foreign bank, the provider discloses “Jane Doe” pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(2)(iii), and the transfer is timely deposited by that bank into Jane Doe's account.  If the sender later asserts that an error occurred because the sender in fact intended the transfer to be sent to “John Doe” but had not communicated that to the provider, no error has occurred under the final rule because “Jane Doe” was the name of the designated recipient stated on the receipt provided to the sender.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>In some cases, however, a sender's name can result in an error.  If, for example, the recipient institution could not deliver the remittance transfer described above because no one named “Jane Doe” had an account at the recipient institution, or more than one person named “Jane Doe” had an account at that institution such that the funds could not be applied, the transfer would be delayed or rejected resulting in an error because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information.  Insofar as this would not lead to the deposit of the transfer in the wrong account, the Bureau is not inclined to include these mistakes in the exception.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Commenters also urged the Bureau to include in the exception to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) to mistakes regarding mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and debit, credit and prepaid card numbers, arguing that these additional categories of identifiers warrant the same treatment as those covered by proposed § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D).  Commenters supporting expansion of the exception to include these identifiers generally put forth the same reasons as those discussed above regarding account numbers and recipient institution identifiers.  These commenters generally did not address the practical differences between transfers sent between bank accounts and those sent to other types of accounts.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not think it appropriate to extend the exception to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to these sorts of identifiers for several reasons.  First, § 1005.31(b)(2)(iii) requires that a remittance transfer provider disclose the name of the designated recipient to the sender and comment 30(c)-1 now clarifies that the designated recipient is identified by the name of the person stated on the disclosure provided pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(iii) regardless of what other identifying information that the sender may also have provided to the provider.  Insofar as a provider must disclose the name of the designated recipient on the receipt provided to the sender, the provider is not permitted to process a remittance transfer under the 2013 Final Rule by only disclosing a non-name identifier, such as a card number, email address, or mobile number.  To the extent providers currently send transfers without disclosing a name to the sender, they will not be able to continue doing so once the 2013 Final Rule takes effect.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Second, the Bureau believes that in the current market, only a small number of providers send remittance transfers to designated recipients who are identified by mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and debit, credit and prepaid card numbers.  These providers are often conducting transfers between two of their own customers through a closed network, and thus are in position to verify designated recipients' identities.  In other words, for transfers conducted through these closed-networks, both the sender and recipient will have agreed to sign on to the provider's network in order to send or receive funds.  The Bureau understands that, today, a number of the providers using these identifiers may not verify that the identifier matches the name of the designated recipient in every instance.  However, the Bureau believes that unlike providers using account numbers to identify designated recipients in transfers through the open network system, these providers have a reasonable ability to implement security measures in order to limit the possibility that senders make mistakes regarding designated recipients' mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and debit, credit and prepaid card numbers.  These measures might include confirmation codes, test transactions, or other methods to prevent transfers from being sent to the wrong person.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>Third, the Bureau believes that the systems are still limited and nascent for transfers in which the mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and debit, credit and prepaid card numbers are used to identify designated recipients and the transfer is not sent entirely over the remittance transfer provider's own network.  As these systems grow, the Bureau expects that providers can proactively design systems in such a way as to allow for the development of better verification protocols.  If, in the future, providers intend to develop new systems to allow transfers using only names and mobile phone numbers to identify designated recipients, for example, the Bureau believes that such systems should be designed to verify that the provided names and numbers match before recipients can receive transfers.  The Bureau does not believe that such methods can be implemented for most transfers sent to bank accounts.  As described above, such transfers are generally sent as wire transfers, through an open network system.</analysisParagraph>
                  <analysisParagraph>As noted, the Bureau has limited the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to account numbers and recipient institution identifiers in order to encourage the growth of improved controls and communication mechanisms that may generally limit the possibility of other errors in the transmission of remittance transfers.  Furthermore, the Bureau intends to monitor closely industry's ability to verify account numbers and recipient institution identifiers and will consider modifying this exception if it thinks such verification methods become reasonably available and are able to prevent most errors from occurring.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>Comment 31(b)(1)-1 Fees and Taxes</title>
            <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(1)-1 to the 2012 Final Rule provides general guidance on the disclosure of fees and taxes.  Comment 31(b)(1)-1.i explains that taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the remittance transfer provider, which are required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii), include taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a State or other governmental body, and comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii focuses more specifically on how to disclose fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider as required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi).</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In the December Proposal, the Bureau proposed additional clarification on other types of recipient institution fees that are, or are not, specifically related to a remittance transfer.  For organizational purposes, the December Proposal divided comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii into new proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii through -1.v.  Specifically, proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii would have contrasted the fees and taxes required to be disclosed by § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) and the fees and taxes required to be disclosed by § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi).  Proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.iii would have revised the reference to taxes imposed by a foreign government to taxes imposed by a foreign country's central government, and the proposed commentary would have built on the existing guidance regarding applicable recipient institution fees to clarify that account fees are not specifically related to a remittance transfer if such fees are merely assessed based on general account activity and not for receiving transfers.  Proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.iv additionally would have explained that a fee that specifically relates to a remittance transfer may be structured on a flat per-transaction basis, or may be conditioned on other factors (such as account status or the quantity of remittance transfers received) in addition to on the remittance transfer itself.  Proposed 31(b)(1)-1.v would have provided that the terms used to describe the fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider in § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) and imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) must differentiate between such fees and taxes.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Insofar as the Bureau is eliminating the requirement to disclose non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, the Bureau is not adopting the proposed revisions to comments 31(b)(1)-1.ii.  Instead, applicable examples concerning the types of fees related to a remittance transfer that must be disclosed have been moved to the commentary to § 1005.30(h), as discussed above. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 30(h)-1.  The Bureau is, however, modifying certain aspects of the remaining commentary in light of the new definitions and the elimination of the requirement to disclose taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider.  In comment 31(b)(1)-1.i of the 2013 Final Rule, the reference to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) is removed to focus on the scope of fees imposed or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by the provider that are required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii).  The Bureau is also revising comments 31(b)(1)-1.ii, 31(b)(1)-2, and 31(b)(1)-3 of the 2013 Final Rule commentary consistent with new scope of the required disclosures and the movement of certain commentary to 30(h).  In addition, the 2013 Final Rule divides existing commentary in 31(b)(1)-1.ii to create a new comment 31(b)(1)-1.iii for clarity.</analysisParagraph>

Comment 31(c)(4)-2 in the 2012 Final Rule clarifies that, for purposes of § 1005.31(c)(4), the following is directly related information: (i) The date and time of the transaction; (ii) the sender's name and contact information; (iii) the location at which the designated recipient may pick up the funds; (iv) the confirmation or other identification code; (v) a company name and logo; (vi) an indication that a disclosure is or is not a receipt or other indicia of proof of payment; (vii) a designated area for signatures or initials; (viii) a statement that funds may be available sooner, as permitted by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii); (ix) instructions regarding the retrieval of funds, such as the number of days the funds will be available to the recipient before they are returned to the sender; and (x) a statement that the provider makes money from foreign currency exchange.

            <title>31(c) Specific Format Requirements</title>
            <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(c) set forth specific format requirements for the written and electronic disclosures required by this section. Proposed § 205.31(c)(1) and (2) contained grouping and proximity requirements for certain disclosures required under proposed § 205.31. Proposed § 205.31(c)(3) set forth prominence and size requirements for disclosures required by subpart B. Proposed § 205.31(c)(4) contained segregation requirements for disclosures provided under subpart B, with certain specified exceptions.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In the proposal, the Board recognized that the specific formatting requirements set forth in proposed § 205.31(c) were more prescriptive than other disclosures required under Regulation E. The Board requested comment on whether certain requirements in proposed § 205.31(c) could be less prescriptive, while still ensuring that senders are provided with clear and conspicuous disclosures. The Board also solicited comment on how the formatting requirements in proposed § 205.31 could be applied to transactions conducted via mobile application or text message.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received comments regarding each of the proposed format requirements, which are discussed in turn below. Additionally, one industry commenter suggested that the formatting requirements in the final rule should accommodate State law disclosures. The Bureau believes it is appropriate to establish formatting requirements tailored to the elements required to be disclosed under the statute. Providers can separately comply with each State's formatting requirements, to the extent that they meet or exceed the requirements set forth in the final rule. The Bureau believes that the proposed formatting requirements will ensure that disclosures are clear and conspicuous as required under EFTA section 919(a)(3)(A) and will thereby help senders understand the costs of remittance transactions. As discussed in the proposal, the formatting requirements demonstrate to senders the mathematical relationship between one line item and another, in part by presenting the required information in a logical sequence. Therefore, the Bureau is generally adopting the formatting requirements as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Commenters also raised concerns regarding the proposed formatting requirements as applied to disclosures provided via mobile application or text message. Industry commenters argued that prescriptive formatting requirements conducive to paper disclosures may not easily apply to new methods of conducting remittance transfers, and that the proposed rule could make compliance difficult as new technologies arise. These commenters urged the Bureau to provide flexibility for formatting requirements for disclosures provided via mobile application or text message. These commenters noted that formatting may be constrained by data and character limits, and that a remittance transfer provider does not necessarily control formatting when disclosures are sent through these methods.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters also noted that senders using mobile applications or text messages could incur additional costs due to the formatting requirements. For example, additional data charges may apply for disclosures provided via mobile application or text message to accommodate formatting requirements. These charges could make senders reluctant to make transfers via mobile application or text message and, therefore, create a disincentive for providers to make remittance transfers available through these alternative methods. They argued that the provider should have the flexibility to provide disclosures using various methods—such as text message, mobile application, email, internet, or mail—as long as the sender is capable of receiving the disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>As discussed above in the supplementary information to § 1005.31(a)(5), remittance transfer providers can provide oral pre-payment disclosures for transactions conducted by mobile application or text message. The Bureau does not believe senders would be less protected by receiving disclosures via mobile application or text message than if they received oral disclosures, even if the mobile applications and text messages are not subject to standard formatting requirements.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Therefore, the Bureau is generally not requiring in the final rule that pre-payment disclosures provided via mobile application or text message comply with the grouping, proximity, font size, and segregation requirements of the final rule. Though these disclosures are not subject to these formatting requirements in the final rule, the Bureau expects that providers will provide mobile application or text message disclosures in a logical sequence to demonstrate to senders the mathematical relationship between one line item and another in order to disclose the information clearly and conspicuously. Moreover, pre-payment disclosures provided via mobile application or text message must be provided in equal prominence to each other, as required in § 1005.31(c)(3), discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisSection>
              <title>31(c)(1) Grouping</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(c)(1) provided that the information about the transfer amount, fees and taxes imposed by the provider, and total amount of transaction must be grouped together. The purpose of this grouping requirement was to make clear to the sender that the total amount charged is comprised of the transfer amount plus any transfer fees and taxes. Proposed § 205.31(c)(1) also provided that the information about the transfer amount in the currency to be made available to the designated recipient, fees and taxes imposed by a person other than the provider, and amount received by the designated recipient must be grouped together. The purpose of this grouping requirement was to make clear to the sender how the total amount to be transferred to the designated recipient, in the currency to be made available to the designated recipient, would be reduced by fees or taxes charged by a person other than the remittance transfer provider.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comments on the proposed grouping requirements beyond the general comments about the proposed formatting requirements, discussed above. Thus, the Bureau is adopting the proposed requirement substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(c)(1), with revisions to address the applicability of the grouping requirements to mobile applications and text messages. Section 1005.31(c)(1) states that the information required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) generally must be grouped together. The information required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(v), (vi), and (vii) generally must be grouped together. Disclosures provided via mobile application or text message, to the extent permitted by § 1005.31(a)(5), need not be grouped together.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(c)(1)-1 is also adopted substantially as proposed. The comment clarifies that information is grouped together for purposes of subpart B if multiple disclosures are in close proximity to one another and a sender can reasonably calculate the total amount of the transaction, and the amount that will be received by the designated recipient. Proposed Model Forms A-30 through A-35 in Appendix A, discussed in more detail below, illustrate how information may be grouped to comply with the rule. The proposed comment also clarifies that a remittance transfer provider may group the information in another manner. For example, a provider could provide the grouped information as a horizontal, rather than a vertical, calculation.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>31(c)(2) Proximity</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(c)(2) provided that the exchange rate must be disclosed in close proximity to the other disclosures on the pre-payment disclosure. The Board stated in the May 2011 Proposed Rule that disclosing the exchange rate in close proximity to both the calculations that demonstrate the total transaction amount, as well as the total amount the recipient would receive, would help a sender understand the effect of the exchange rate on the transaction. Proposed § 205.31(c)(2) also provided that error resolution and cancellation disclosures must be disclosed in close proximity to the other disclosures on the receipt. The Board determined in consumer testing that providing a brief statement regarding error resolution and cancellation rights located near the other disclosures effectively communicated these rights to a sender. Therefore, the Board provided that the error resolution and cancellation disclosures should be closely proximate to the other disclosures on the receipt to prevent such disclosures from being overlooked by a sender.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comment on the proposed proximity requirements beyond the general comments addressing the proposed formatting requirements discussed above. Thus, the Bureau is adopting the proposed requirement substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(c)(2), with revisions to address the applicability of the proximity requirements to mobile applications and text messages. Section 1005.31(c)(2) states that the exchange rate disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) generally must be disclosed in close proximity to the other information required by § 1005.31(b)(1). The abbreviated statement about the sender's error resolution and cancellation rights required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) generally must be disclosed in close proximity to the other information required by § 1005.31(b)(2). Disclosures provided orally or via mobile application or text message, to the extent permitted by § 1005.31(a)(5), need not comply with the proximity requirements of § 1005.31(c)(2).</analysisParagraph>

The proposed rule provided that written and electronic disclosures required by subpart B must be made in a minimum eight-point font. The Board solicited comment on whether a minimum font size should be required and, if so, whether an eight-point font size is appropriate.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter supported the eight-point font requirement. However, other industry commenters urged the Bureau to eliminate the eight-point font requirement. These commenters argued that the font requirement would add unnecessary compliance costs that did not have a corresponding consumer benefit. Industry commenters argued that the font requirement may not create the desired consistency in disclosures, because, for example, fonts may display differently on different screens and printers. Rather, these commenters believed the Bureau should only require that the disclosures be subject to either a clear and conspicuous or clear and readily understandable standard.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that disclosures should be disclosed in at least an eight-point font, as proposed. As discussed in the proposal, the disclosures that the Board developed for consumer testing used eight-point font, consistent with the font size typically used in register receipts. Participants in the Board's consumer testing generally found that the disclosures were readable, and they were able to locate the different disclosure elements during testing. The Bureau agrees with the Board that disclosures provided in a smaller font could diminish the readability and noticeability of the disclosures. Therefore, the eight-point font requirement is generally retained in the final rule. However, given the particular concerns raised above with respect to mobile disclosures, the final rule does not apply the font requirement to disclosures made by mobile application or text message, to the extent permitted by § 1005.31(a)(5).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(c)(3) further provided that written disclosures required by subpart B must be on the front of the page on which the disclosure is printed. The proposed paragraph also provided that each of the written and electronic disclosures required under proposed § 205.31(b) must be in equal prominence to each other. One industry commenter asked the Bureau to clarify how written and electronic disclosures should be disclosed in equal prominence to each other. As discussed in the proposal, disclosures that must be equally prominent to each other should be displayed in the same font and type size.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting the prominence and size requirement substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(c)(3), with revisions to address the applicability of the font size requirement to mobile applications and text messages and revisions to better clarify that only disclosures provided in writing or electronically must be provided in equal prominence to each other and in eight-point font. Section 1005.31(c)(3) states that written disclosures required by subpart B must be provided on the front of the page on which the disclosure is printed. Disclosures required by subpart B that are provided in writing or electronically must be in a minimum eight-point font, except for disclosures provided via mobile application or text message to the extent permitted by § 1005.31(a)(5). Disclosures required by § 1005.31(b) that are provided in writing or electronically must be in equal prominence to each other.</analysisParagraph>

              <title>31(c)(4) Segregation</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(c)(4) provided that written and electronic disclosures required by subpart B must be segregated from everything else and contain only information that is directly related to the disclosures required under subpart B. Proposed comment 31(c)(4)-1 clarified how a remittance transfer provider could segregate disclosures. Proposed comment 31(c)(4)-2 identified information that would be considered directly related to the required disclosures, for purposes of determining what information must be segregated from the required disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed the segregation of required disclosures from other information to avoid overloading the sender with information that could distract from the required disclosures. In permitting directly related information to be included with the required disclosures, the Board recognized that certain information not required by the statute or regulation could be integral to the transaction. The Board stated that remittance transfer providers should be able to communicate this information, such as the confirmation code that a designated recipient must provide in order to receive the funds, to a sender. The Board requested comment on the proposed segregation requirement and whether additional information should be permitted to be included with the required segregated disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters requested further guidance on the segregation requirement, including clarification regarding how disclosures presented on a computer screen could be segregated, and whether disclosures would be considered segregated in a variety of mailing scenarios, including when disclosures are mailed on or with a periodic statement. The Bureau believes proposed comment 31(c)(4)-1 provides sufficient guidance to enable providers to determine whether the disclosures are segregated in a variety of scenarios. For example, the comment requires segregated disclosures to be set off from other information, such as disclosures required by states, but does not require the information to be displayed on a separate sheet of paper. The comment also explains that disclosures may be set off from other information on a notice by outlining them in a box or series of boxes, with bold print dividing lines or a different color background, or by using other means. A provider could apply this guidance to develop, for example, segregated disclosures set off in a box on a periodic statement or set off with a different color background on a computer screen. Therefore, the Bureau is finalizing comment 31(c)(4)-1 substantially as proposed, but adds another example for clarity.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters also suggested that certain additional information should be deemed “directly related” to the required disclosures, such that it would not have to be segregated from the required disclosures. Suggested additions included information regarding the retrieval of funds, such as the number of days the funds will be available to the recipient before the funds are returned to the sender, and a statement that a provider makes money from foreign currency exchange. The Bureau agrees that this information is directly related to the required disclosures and need not be segregated from them. Therefore, the Bureau is adding these to the list of “directly related” items in comment 31(c)(4)-2.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting the segregation requirement substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(c)(4), with revisions to address the applicability of the requirement to mobile applications and text messages and revisions to better clarify that only disclosures provided in writing or electronically must be segregated. Section 1005.31(c)(4) states that except for disclosures provided via mobile application or text message, to the extent permitted by § 1005.31(a)(5), disclosures required by subpart B that are provided in writing or electronically must be segregated from everything else and must contain only information that is directly related to the disclosures required under subpart B. Comment 31(c)(4)-1 of the final rule clarifies that disclosures may be segregated from other information in a variety of ways. For example, the disclosures may appear on a separate sheet of paper or may be set off from other information on a notice by outlining them in a box or series of boxes, with bold print dividing lines or a different color background, or by using other means.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(c)(4)-2 in the final rule clarifies that, for purposes of § 1005.31(c)(4), the following is directly related information: (i) The date and time of the transaction; (ii) the sender's name and contact information; (iii) the location at which the designated recipient may pick up the funds; (iv) the confirmation or other identification code; (v) a company name and logo; (vi) an indication that a disclosure is or is not a receipt or other indicia of proof of payment; (vii) a designated area for signatures or initials; (viii) a statement that funds may be available sooner, as permitted by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii); (ix) instructions regarding the retrieval of funds, such as the number of days the funds will be available to the recipient before they are returned to the sender; and (x) a statement that the provider makes money from foreign currency exchange.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>33(a)(1)(iv)(D)</title>
            <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) of the 2012 Final Rule defines as an error a remittance transfer provider's failure to make funds available to the designated recipient by the date of availability stated on the receipt or combined disclosure, subject to three listed exceptions, including an exception for remittance transfers made with fraudulent intent by the sender or a person working in concert with the sender. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C).  Comment 33(a)-5 to the 2012 Final Rule elaborates on the definition of the term “error” under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) and explains that such errors under subpart B of Regulation E include, among other things, the late delivery of funds, the total non-delivery of a remittance transfer, and the delivery of funds to the wrong account. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comments 33(a)-5.1 and .ii.  The commentary further notes that if only a portion of the funds are made available by the disclosed date of availability, then § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) does not apply, but § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) may apply instead.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>As explained under comment 33(c)-2 in the 2012 Final Rule, an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) would include situations where a remittance transfer provider failed to make funds in connection with a remittance transfer available to a designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability because the sender provided an incorrect account number to the remittance transfer provider.  After issuance of the 2012 Final Rule, the Bureau received comments from industry that providers often have no means to verify designated recipients' account numbers for remittance transfers into foreign bank accounts.  As a result, providers could have to bear the potentially significant costs of their customers' mistakes in cases in which funds were deposited in the wrong account and could not be recovered as a result of the sender's provision of an incorrect account number.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In the December Proposal, the Bureau proposed to revise the definition of error in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) by adding a fourth, conditional exception.  Proposed § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) would have excluded from the definition of error a failure to make funds available to the designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability, where such failure resulted from the sender having given the remittance transfer provider an incorrect account number, provided that the provider met the conditions set forth in proposed § 1005.33(h).  These proposed conditions, would have required providers to notify senders of the risk that their funds could be lost, to investigate reported errors, and to attempt to recover the missing funds.  In addition, the exception would have been limited to situations in which the funds were actually deposited into the wrong account.  Where these conditions were met, the proposed exception would not have required providers to bear the cost of refunding or resending transfers.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau sought comment on the proposed exception generally and whether it should be limited to mistakes regarding account numbers or expanded to include other incorrect information provided by senders in connection with remittance transfers, such as routing numbers.  Each of these is discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisSection>
              <title>Exception for Senders' Mistakes Regarding Account Numbers</title>
              <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters uniformly supported the addition of the proposed exception to the definition of error where the error was caused by the sender's provision of an incorrect account number.  They put forth a number of reasons why they favored the proposed change.  In many respects, these comments expanded upon those received prior to the December Proposal.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters reiterated earlier concerns about the large potential exposure given their general inability of remittance transfer providers to validate the accuracy of a designated recipient's account number provided in connection with a wire transfers and similar types of open network transfers sent to accounts at banks and other institutions abroad.  These commenters argued that providers sending these transfers over open networks generally have limited ability to cross-check account numbers with the names of accountholders prior to sending transfers because they often have no direct relationships with recipient institutions and thus no means of accessing those institutions' account information.  Commenters further stated that as a result, the only way for a provider to validate such numbers may be to contact the recipient institution manually, which may be time-consuming and difficult due to language and time zone issues.  Such validation would necessitate manual handling of remittance transfers and limit the ability of providers to use automated systems, which are less costly than manual handling of each transfer.  Commenters stated their concern that manual validation could substantially increase costs to senders and delay the processing of remittance transfers.  Relatedly, several commenters claimed that it was infeasible to expect providers to develop account number verification systems, automated or otherwise, before the effective date of the 2012 Final Rule (which was scheduled to take effect on February 7, 2013) due to the number of institutions worldwide that would need to adjust their systems used for transmitting wires.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters also reiterated concerns expressed prior to the issuance of the December Proposal regarding the potential for fraud if a sender's provision of an incorrect account number is considered an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv).  As discussed in the December Proposal, commenters had stated that the 2012 Final Rule could enable fraudulent activity to flourish because, if unscrupulous senders provided incorrect account numbers and funds were sent to a coconspirator, remittance transfer providers might have to send transfer amounts again to another coconspirator without first recovering them.  Commenters argued that the fraud exception in the 2012 Final Rule—§ 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C)—is insufficient because for providers to use the exception would be difficult in most circumstances.  Many industry commenters stated that providers in the United States typically have a limited ability to gather evidence of fraud from a recipient institution abroad or to mandate cooperation from foreign institutions with whom they have no direct relationship.  Industry commenters also noted that even if a provider suspected fraud, the lack of evidence would cause providers to hesitate to accuse one of its own customers of fraud.  Industry commenters also stated that the 2012 Final Rule departed from current industry practice by requiring that remittance transfer providers resend or refund a remittance transfer even when a sender's mistake results in mis-delivery of funds that cannot be recovered.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters expressed concern that in light of the significant exposure under the 2012 Final Rule's sender error provisions, if the Bureau did not revise the error resolution procedures as it proposed to do in the December Proposal, many remittance transfer providers would curtail their remittance transfer offerings such as by limiting the amount permitted per transfer, limiting transfers to certain trusted customers, or by exiting the remittance transfer business altogether.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters also argued that the Bureau should not have adopted the approach taken in the 2012 Final Rule to sender error because it was not mandated by statute.  One of these commenters opined that because the Dodd-Frank Act was not specific with respect to who must bear the cost of a mis-directed remittance transfer, the Bureau's legal authority to require remittance transfer providers to bear the cost of mistakes made by senders was questionable.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In contrast to comments from industry, consumer group commenters were divided on whether the Bureau should adopt the proposed exception for certain sender errors.  Two consumer groups supported the proposed change because, they contended, the proposed rule achieved the appropriate allocation of risk between senders and remittance transfer providers and incentivized providers to minimize the occurrence of errors.  These commenters also stated that it would be difficult for providers, particularly small providers, to retrieve funds sent to the wrong account.  They further asserted that it would be difficult for providers, and particularly credit unions, to accuse their customers or members of fraud in order to avail themselves of the fraud exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C).  As a result, these consumer group commenters argued that absent the proposed revision, many providers might choose to exit the remittance transfer business altogether, resulting in a loss of access to senders.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Other consumer groups opposed the proposed changes and urged the Bureau not to amend the 2012 Final Rule with respect to sender mistakes regarding account numbers that result in the loss of the transfer amount.  First, some of these groups argued that the Bureau would be undermining the intent of Congress, which, they argued, was to motivate industry to change existing practices to develop more secure means of sending remittance transfers.  By adopting the proposed exception, these commenters argued, the Bureau would eliminate any incentive for remittance transfer providers to develop enhanced security procedures.  Relatedly, some consumer groups also argued that the existing definition of error in subpart A of Regulation E, specifically § 1005.11(a)(ii), already addresses the situation in which a consumer provides an incorrect recipient account number by creating an error for “incorrect” electronic fund transfers.<footnote ref="8">Section 1005.11 of subpart A of Regulation E contains error resolution provisions for electronic fund transfers.  Section 1005.11(a)(ii) states that a potential error under the rule is an “incorrect electronic fund transfer to or from the consumer's account.”</footnote>
                These commenters noted that insofar as § 1005.11(a)(ii) is phrased in general terms and refers to an “incorrect electronic fund transfer” by its plain language it does not exclude incorrect information provided by a consumer (or any other party).  Insofar as § 1005.11(a)(ii) has long applied to a portion of remittance transfers, the commenters contended that had Congress intended to deny the protections of this provision to consumers, it would have done so more explicitly.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Finally, some consumer group commenters suggested that the Bureau should not adopt the proposed exception to the definition of error, even if the 2012 Final Rule would result in some remittance transfer providers exiting the market because they are unable to implement adequate verification procedures today.  Alternatively, these commenters suggested that, in order to reduce the risk of market exit, that the Bureau could adopt the proposed revisions, but limit the proposed exception to the definition of error to transfers over a certain dollar amount so that senders of smaller transfers would still benefit from the error provisions in the 2012 Final Rule.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Upon consideration of these comments and further consideration and to facilitate compliance, the Bureau is finalizing § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) with several changes from the proposed provision, which are discussed below.  As in the December Proposal, the exception as finalized will only apply if a remittance transfer provider can meet certain conditions including warnings to senders and use of reasonable validation methods where available.  These conditions are set forth in § 1005.33(h) and also are discussed in detail below.  Where the exception applies, providers will not be required to bear the cost of refunding or resending transfers if funds ultimately cannot be recovered.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As it noted in the December Proposal, the Bureau believes that this exception appropriately allocates risk based on remittance transfer providers' existing methods for sending transfers, which often do not allow for or facilitate verification of designated recipients' account numbers.  The Bureau continues to believe it is important for industry to develop improved security procedures and expects to engage in a dialogue with industry about how to encourage the growth of improved controls and communication mechanisms.  But the Bureau understands that industry is unlikely to be reasonably able to implement such changes in the near future.  Subpart B of Regulation E does not regulate most recipient institutions, and the Bureau has concluded that individual providers, and particularly those sending transfers through open networks have limited ability to influence the practices of financial institutions worldwide in the short term.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Absent such changes, the Bureau is concerned that remittance transfer providers will exit the market or reduce remittance offerings rather than risk having to bear the cost of the entire transfer amount where funds are deposited into the wrong  account due to the sender's provision of an incorrect account number.  The Bureau believes such an interim disruption would not be in consumers' best interests, and thus has finalized the proposed exception as discussed below.  The Bureau, however, will continue to evaluate the development of procedures as it monitors providers' implementation of and compliance with the 2013 Final Rule.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau disagrees with those consumer group commenters that the 2012 Final Rule should be allowed to take effect absent the proposed exception for sender account number mistakes, and that the Bureau should instead monitor whether the concerns summarized in the December Proposal—such as increased fraud and remittance transfer providers exiting the market—actually materialize.  As stated above and in the December Proposal, the Bureau is concerned that absent the proposed change, some providers would severely curtail their offerings or withdraw from the remittance transfer business altogether, and such a market change could have a negative impact on senders.  The Bureau also does not believe, as commenters suggested, that it is appropriate to limit the scope of the exception to larger value transfers, because doing so could potentially encourage providers to limit senders' access to smaller value transfers.  In addition, the Bureau does not believe it appropriate to engage in line drawing or to provide differential protections in this circumstance.  Furthermore, the Bureau disagrees that the proposed exception would harm senders in that the exception in many ways maintains the status quo insofar as the Bureau believes that, today, senders typically bear the loss when their mistake leads to a mis-deposit.  Nor does the Bureau believe that the problem of senders losing the transfer amount is particularly widespread today; insofar as the status quo is maintained, the Bureau does not expect this to change.  The Bureau's outreach confirmed that in most cases where there is a problem in the transmission of a remittance transfer, the provider is able to retrieve the funds or have them routed properly.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>With regard to commenters' arguments about the Bureau's statutory authority, the Bureau disagrees both with industry participant and consumer group arguments that the EFTA or section 1073 of the Dodd-Frank Act specifies which party must bear the cost of a sender's mistake with respect to remittance transfer.  Rather, EFTA section 919 gives the Bureau broad discretion to set standards for remittance transfer providers with respect to error resolution, including to define errors, and does not mandate a specific result with regard to which party should bear the risk of loss under any particular circumstances.  Nor does the Bureau believe that the definition of error in subpart A of Regulation E, which does not apply to all remittance transfers, precludes the Bureau from adopting more specifically tailored error resolutions, and corresponding definitions, applicable to all remittance transfers under subpart B of Regulation E. <em data-original="E-03">See also</em> § 1005.33(f).  Accordingly, the Bureau has adopted the proposed exception for sender account number mistakes subject to specific conditions discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
            </analysisSection>
            <analysisSection>
              <title>The Scope of the Sender Error Exception</title>
              <analysisParagraph>As noted above the Bureau also sought comment on the scope of the proposed exception to the definition of error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) and whether it should apply to incorrect information provided by senders in addition to designated recipients' account numbers and, in particular, whether the proposed exception should apply in cases in which senders make mistakes regarding routing numbers or similar institution identifiers in addition to mistakes regarding account numbers.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In response, many industry commenters suggested that the proposed exception be expanded to refer to sender mistakes regarding any information provided by a sender in connection with a remittance transfer rather than just mistaken account numbers, as proposed.  Other commenters listed specific types of incorrect information that should be addressed by the exception to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv), such as:  Routing numbers, Business Identifier Codes (BICs), Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication codes (SWIFT codes), International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs), local bank codes, prepaid, debit or credit card account numbers, recipient institutions' names, designated recipients' names, escrow account numbers, currencies in which transfers will be received, incomplete wire instructions, and recipients' email addresses, phone numbers, and addresses.  Commenters offered different reasons as to why the proposed exception should be expanded to include sender mistakes regarding each suggested type of information.  In addition to considering these comments, the Bureau conducted additional outreach to understand the nature of errors related to the suggested types of information and why remittance transfer providers thought they should be included in any exception to an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) in the 2012 Final Rule.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Many of the industry commenters that urged that the proposed exception should be extended to all mistakes made by senders argued, as noted above, that there is no statutory basis to make remittance transfer providers bear the cost of all senders' mistakes.  Relatedly, one commenter argued that no other consumer finance statute protects consumers from their own errors and that there is a distinction between allocating risk to a provider for mistakes by third parties, or where fault cannot be determined, and requiring providers to bear the cost of senders' mistakes.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As for the specific types of information provided by senders, nearly all industry commenters and some consumer group commenters favored expanding the proposed exception to apply to sender mistakes regarding routing numbers and other recipient institution identifiers.  Commenters explained that for many remittance transfers into accounts, remittance transfer providers request, in addition to the number of the designated recipient's account, an alphanumeric identifier of the recipient institution, similar to the routing numbers used to identify depository institutions in the United States.<footnote ref="9">For example, in order to route a wire transfer to a foreign bank, a bank in the United States may require that the sender provide the name of the designated recipient and the recipient's institution as well as the BIC for the recipient's institution, and the recipient's account number.</footnote>
                Providers, and any other intermediaries involved in the transfer, then use this identifier to determine the institution to which the transfer should be sent.  Commenters further explained that, in many cases, a sender's mistake regarding the identifier of a bank could pose a similar problem for a provider as an incorrect account number.  The commenters stated that, like account numbers, many providers lack the ability to verify the accuracy of alphanumerical identifiers related to recipient institutions that are provided by senders.  If a recipient institution identifier is incorrect and the provider does not match it with an institution name, funds could conceivably be mis-deposited if the institution represented by the incorrect routing number has an account matching the number provided by the sender.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In addition to sender  mistakes regarding account numbers and recipient institution identifiers, several commenters asked that the Bureau exclude from the definition of error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) senders' mistakes regarding correspondent routing instructions (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> if the sender suggests that the remittance transfer provider send the transfer through a particular correspondent that is unable to complete the transfer).  Several commenters stated that generally this sort of mistake generally would lead to a delay of a transfer and not its mis-deposit into the wrong account.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Finally, several industry commenters argued that the proposed exception should be expanded to apply to senders' mistakes regarding designated recipients' names and information that the designated recipient themselves might need to apply the proceeds of remittance transfers after receipt.  For example, a trade association commenter asked that the Bureau expand the proposed exception to include sender mistakes about additional information a designated recipient needs to process a transfer it receives.  The commenter stated that if, for example, the designated recipient is an insurer, it might need the designated recipient's policy number to process the funds received.  Similarly, one commenter stated that if a designated recipient is a property lessor, the lessor might need an identifying apartment number in order to process a transfer that is a rent payment.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>After careful consideration of the comments received and upon further consideration, the Bureau is expanding the exception to the definition of error in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to include situations where a sender has provided an incorrect recipient institution identifier in addition to situations where a sender provides an incorrect account number, as long as the error results in a mis-deposit of the funds and that the remittance transfer provider meets the conditions set forth in § 1005.33(h).  As discussed below, the 2013 Final Rule includes as one such condition, that the provider use reasonably available means to verify the recipient institution identifier provided by the sender. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(h)(2).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Based on its monitoring of the remittance market, review of comment letters, and other outreach, the Bureau believes that situations in which an incorrect recipient institution identifier could result in a transfer being deposited into the wrong account are exceedingly rare but not unheard of.  More typically, the Bureau understands, a mistaken identifier will result in a transfer that is returned to the remittance transfer provider because either the identifier does not match any institution or the account number does not match an account at the institution to which the transfer is mistakenly directed.  Nevertheless, the Bureau is expanding the exception in the 2013 Final Rule beyond what was proposed because, upon further consideration, it believes that it is appropriate to treat mistakes in recipient institution identifiers similarly to mistakes in account numbers.  The two types of identifiers are similar in purpose and, in some cases, are combined into one.  In addition, these identifiers may not be easily verifiable by providers sending remittance transfers over an open network and are used in straight-through, automated processing of transfers.  Additionally, although less likely than as with respect to account numbers, under the 2012 Final Rule an unscrupulous sender could potentially provide an incorrect routing number to perpetrate a fraud with a coconspirator abroad.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Contrary to requests by commenters that the Bureau extend the proposed exception for sender mistakes regarding account numbers to mistakes regarding all types of information, the Bureau is limiting the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to sender mistakes regarding account numbers and recipient institution identifiers because it does not believe it is appropriate to extend the exception to all mistakes a sender might make in connection with a remittance transfer for several reasons.  While the chance of mis-deposit is limited for all sender mistakes, the Bureau believes there is a greater risk for mistakes regarding account numbers and recipient institution identifiers.  However, for most other types of sender mistakes identified by commenters, such as mistakes regarding the recipient's address or wire instructions, the Bureau does not believe that the incorrect information would usually result in a mis-deposit of a remittance transfer.  Instead, the Bureau believes that these mistakes will at most result in a delay of delivery or in non-delivery of the remittance transfer.  In situations where the recipient institution identifies a customer with the same name as the designated recipient but is unable to match that customer's name to the provided account number, the Bureau believes that the recipient institution will generally be unable to apply the funds and that the transfer will be returned or otherwise delayed but that the funds will not be mis-deposited.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe that it is warranted to extend the exception to those sender mistakes that are likely to result only in either a delay or a return of the transfer to the remittance transfer provider, and not the loss of funds, because the cost to the provider of delay or non-delivery differs markedly from the cost of lost transfers.  Under the 2012 Final Rule, when a transfer is delayed or returned to the provider, the provider must refund its fee to the sender. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii).  Additionally, when the transfer is returned to the provider, the sender can request that the transfer be resent at no charge (although third-party fees may be imposed on the resend) or have the transfer amount refunded. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii).  The cost to the provider in these circumstances differs markedly from the cost to the provider under the 2012 Final Rule for a transfer that is mis-deposited into the wrong account and cannot be retrieved.  When a mis-deposit occurs, absent an exception, the provider may have to resend or refund the entire transfer amount if the transfer could not be retrieved from the wrong account rather than merely refund its fee or send a transfer at no cost. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii) and comment 33(c)-2 in the 2012 Final Rule.  Thus, for mis-deposited transfers, the fact that the provider is potentially at risk of having to absorb a loss of principal is far higher than for other types of errors and thus is far more likely to lead to a significant curtailment of services.  Furthermore, the Bureau believes that, in many respects, the remedy under the 2012 Final Rule for non-delivery is similar to many providers' existing practices in that they now resend funds at no charge with the corrected information.  Therefore, to maintain as an error sender mistakes that merely result in delay or non-delivery of the remittance transfer as part of this final rule would not require a significant adjustment for those providers.  Finally, the 2012 Final Rule already allows providers a mechanism to manage uncertainty regarding the date of delivery of funds. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) and comment 32(b)(2)-1 (interpreting § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) to allow a provider to disclose the “latest date on which funds will be available”).</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters suggested that the Bureau should make senders, rather than providers, bear the costs of their own mistakes because no other consumer protection regimes makes the regulated entities bear the costs of consumers' mistakes.  The Bureau does not think it is necessary or appropriate that the remittances rules' remedy provisions match perfectly those in other consumer protection regimes, given the unique statutory structure and nature of the transactions at issue.  The Bureau is maintaining the 2012 Final Rule's error provisions regarding sender mistakes other than those covered by the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D), because it believes providers are generally in the best position to institute systems to limit their occurrence and to work with other industry participants to resolve particular mistakes in transmissions.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>With respect to those mistakes that are likely to result only in a delay or non-delivery of a remittance transfer (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> mistakes other than those regarding account number or the recipient institution identifier), the Bureau believes that retaining the current rule, which does not include an exception for such mistakes, strikes the appropriate balance been protecting senders and encouraging providers to limit the incidence of such errors without exposing providers to the risk of loss of the transfer amount.  With respect to those sender mistakes that make it impossible for the recipient (as opposed to the recipient institution) to know how to use the funds received (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> an apartment number to apply a rent payment), the Bureau does not believe that such mistakes would give rise to an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv).  This is true because the 2013 Final Rule only does not define as an error the inability of the designated recipient to timely apply the funds for a particular purpose once a transfer is received.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also does not believe that a sender's provision of an incorrect name would result in an error under the 2013 Final Rule, and thus a sender's provision of an incorrect name need not be included in the exception from the term error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D).  As defined under § 1005.30(c), a designated recipient is “any person specified by the sender as the authorized recipient of a remittance transfer to be received at a foreign country.”  As noted above, comment 30(c)-1 in the 2012 Final Rule stated that a designated recipient can be either a natural person or an organization, such as a corporation.  The Bureau is further clarifying this comment in the 2013 Final Rule to explain that the designated recipient is identified by the name of the person provided by the sender to the remittance transfer provider and disclosed by the provider to the sender pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(iii). <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 30(c)-1.  Thus, assume for example that a sender tells a remittance transfer provider to send a transfer to “Jane Doe” at a foreign bank, the provider discloses “Jane Doe” pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(2)(iii), and the transfer is timely deposited by that bank into Jane Doe's account.  If the sender later asserts that an error occurred because the sender in fact intended the transfer to be sent to “John Doe” but had not communicated that to the provider, no error has occurred under the final rule because “Jane Doe” was the name of the designated recipient stated on the receipt provided to the sender.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In some cases, however, a sender's name can result in an error.  If, for example, the recipient institution could not deliver the remittance transfer described above because no one named “Jane Doe” had an account at the recipient institution, or more than one person named “Jane Doe” had an account at that institution such that the funds could not be applied, the transfer would be delayed or rejected resulting in an error because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information.  Insofar as this would not lead to the deposit of the transfer in the wrong account, the Bureau is not inclined to include these mistakes in the exception.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Commenters also urged the Bureau to include in the exception to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) to mistakes regarding mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and debit, credit and prepaid card numbers, arguing that these additional categories of identifiers warrant the same treatment as those covered by proposed § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D).  Commenters supporting expansion of the exception to include these identifiers generally put forth the same reasons as those discussed above regarding account numbers and recipient institution identifiers.  These commenters generally did not address the practical differences between transfers sent between bank accounts and those sent to other types of accounts.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not think it appropriate to extend the exception to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to these sorts of identifiers for several reasons.  First, § 1005.31(b)(2)(iii) requires that a remittance transfer provider disclose the name of the designated recipient to the sender and comment 30(c)-1 now clarifies that the designated recipient is identified by the name of the person stated on the disclosure provided pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(iii) regardless of what other identifying information that the sender may also have provided to the provider.  Insofar as a provider must disclose the name of the designated recipient on the receipt provided to the sender, the provider is not permitted to process a remittance transfer under the 2013 Final Rule by only disclosing a non-name identifier, such as a card number, email address, or mobile number.  To the extent providers currently send transfers without disclosing a name to the sender, they will not be able to continue doing so once the 2013 Final Rule takes effect.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Second, the Bureau believes that in the current market, only a small number of providers send remittance transfers to designated recipients who are identified by mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and debit, credit and prepaid card numbers.  These providers are often conducting transfers between two of their own customers through a closed network, and thus are in position to verify designated recipients' identities.  In other words, for transfers conducted through these closed-networks, both the sender and recipient will have agreed to sign on to the provider's network in order to send or receive funds.  The Bureau understands that, today, a number of the providers using these identifiers may not verify that the identifier matches the name of the designated recipient in every instance.  However, the Bureau believes that unlike providers using account numbers to identify designated recipients in transfers through the open network system, these providers have a reasonable ability to implement security measures in order to limit the possibility that senders make mistakes regarding designated recipients' mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and debit, credit and prepaid card numbers.  These measures might include confirmation codes, test transactions, or other methods to prevent transfers from being sent to the wrong person.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>Third, the Bureau believes that the systems are still limited and nascent for transfers in which the mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and debit, credit and prepaid card numbers are used to identify designated recipients and the transfer is not sent entirely over the remittance transfer provider's own network.  As these systems grow, the Bureau expects that providers can proactively design systems in such a way as to allow for the development of better verification protocols.  If, in the future, providers intend to develop new systems to allow transfers using only names and mobile phone numbers to identify designated recipients, for example, the Bureau believes that such systems should be designed to verify that the provided names and numbers match before recipients can receive transfers.  The Bureau does not believe that such methods can be implemented for most transfers sent to bank accounts.  As described above, such transfers are generally sent as wire transfers, through an open network system.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>As noted, the Bureau has limited the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to account numbers and recipient institution identifiers in order to encourage the growth of improved controls and communication mechanisms that may generally limit the possibility of other errors in the transmission of remittance transfers.  Furthermore, the Bureau intends to monitor closely industry's ability to verify account numbers and recipient institution identifiers and will consider modifying this exception if it thinks such verification methods become reasonably available and are able to prevent most errors from occurring.</analysisParagraph>

Comment 33(a)-7 in the 2013 Final Rule now states that the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) applies where a sender gives the remittance transfer provider an incorrect account number or recipient institution identifier and all five conditions in § 1005.33(h) are satisfied.  The exception does not apply, however, where the failure to make funds available is the result of a mistake by a provider or a third party or due to incorrect or insufficient information provided by the sender other than an incorrect account number or recipient institution identifier, such as an incorrect name of the recipient institution.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>32(b)(3) Estimates for Non-Covered Third-Party Fees and Taxes Collected by a Person Other Than the Provider</title>
            <analysisParagraph>As described above, the Bureau is eliminating the requirement to disclose certain recipient institution fees and taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider and to include such amounts in the amount received, required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) and (b)(2)(i).  Nevertheless, the Bureau believes that where the remittance transfer provider knows or can reasonably estimate any applicable non-covered third-party fee or tax collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider and elects to disclose one or both of such amounts, senders are likely to benefit from more accurate and informative disclosures.  Consequently, § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) permits a provider to disclose any applicable non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider applicable to a remittance transfer in conjunction with the required disclaimers.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In order to encourage the optional disclosure of such information, § 1005.32(b)(3) of the 2013 Final Rule permits remittance transfer providers latitude to estimate any applicable non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider.  Such estimates may be based on reasonable sources of information.  The Bureau acknowledges that permitting providers to estimate such amounts may result in providers providing disclosures that may not reflect the actual charge by individual recipient institutions or the taxes levied upon such transfers.  Nonetheless, the Bureau believes that permitting a reasonable approximation of the amount of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on the remittance transfer by persons other than the remittance transfer provider that could be assessed based on reasonable sources would provide senders valuable information about the amount to be received while also allowing the provider sufficient flexibility to disclose such information.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>New comment 32(b)(3)-1 further notes that reasonable sources of information may include, for example: Information obtained from recent transfers to the same institution or the same country or region; fee schedules from the recipient institution; fee schedules from the recipient institution's competitors; surveys of recipient institution fees in the same country or region as the recipient institution; information provided or surveys of recipient institutions' regulators or taxing authorities; commercially or publicly available databases, services or sources; and information or resources developed by international nongovernmental organizations or intergovernmental organizations.  The 2013 Final Rule also includes new model forms that provides examples of how such information may be integrated within the disclaimers of § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii). <em data-original="E-03">See</em> Model Forms 30(b)-(d).</analysisParagraph>

              <title>Additional Conforming Edits to § 1005.32</title>
              <analysisParagraph>In addition, because of the changes made to the disclosure requirements under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), § 1005.32(b)(2)(ii) and (c)(3)(i) have been amended to conform with the requirements of § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), as amended, which requires that a party disclose only covered third-party fees.  Conforming changes have also been made to comments 32(a)(1)-1, (a)(1)-2.ii, 32(a)(1)-3.ii, and 32(b)(2)-1 so that these comments and related headings, as finalized, use the term “covered third-party fees” rather than “other fees.”</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In § 1005.32(c)(3)(ii), however, the Bureau notes that it has retained a reference to fees imposed by both the intermediary and the final recipient's institution.  Although fees imposed by the recipient institution are generally non-covered third-party fees, under § 1005.30(h), certain recipient institution fees may qualify as covered third-party fees if they are imposed by an agent of the provider. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 30(h)-2.ii.</analysisParagraph>
              <analysisParagraph>In addition to the conforming changes related to the disclosure of covered third-party fees pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), references to taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider in § 1005.32(b)(2)(ii) and (c)(4) of the 2012 Final Rule have been deleted and § 1005.32(c)(5) has been renumbered as § 1005.32(c)(4).  Several comments clarifying how to estimate these taxes have also been deleted, including comments 32(a)(1)-2.iii, 32(a)(1)-3.iii and 32(c)(4)-1.</analysisParagraph>
