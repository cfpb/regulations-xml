The term also does not include an <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">account</ref> used solely to make disbursements unrelated to compensation, such as petty cash reimbursements or travel per diem payments.

While such <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">accounts</ref> would not be <ref target="1005-2-b-3-i-A" reftype="term">payroll card accounts</ref>, such <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">accounts</ref> could constitute <ref target="1005-2-b-3-i" reftype="term">prepaid accounts</ref> generally, provided the other conditions of the definition of that term in § 1005.2(b)(3) are satisfied.

Bank X is the issuer even if the <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> applied for the <ref target="1005-2-b-3-i" reftype="term">prepaid account</ref> through a link on Bank Y's Web site and the cards prominently feature the Bank Y logo on the front of the card.</content>

              <content>An issuer has a legal obligation to comply with the requirements of § 1005.19. However, an issuer generally may use a third-party service provider to satisfy its obligations under § 1005.19, provided that the issuer <ref target="1005-2-c" reftype="term">acts</ref> in accordance with regulatory guidance regarding use of third-party service providers and other applicable regulatory guidance. In some cases, an issuer may wish to arrange for the entity with which it partners to issue <ref target="1005-2-b-3-i" reftype="term">prepaid accounts</ref> to fulfill the requirements of § 1005.19 on the issuer's behalf. For example, Program Manager and Bank work together to issue <ref target="1005-2-b-3-i" reftype="term">prepaid accounts</ref>. Under the § 1005.19(a)(4) definition of issuer, Bank is the issuer of these <ref target="1005-2-b-3-i" reftype="term">prepaid accounts</ref> for purposes of § 1005.19.

While Bank is responsible for ensuring compliance with § 1005.19, Bank may arrange for Program Manager (or another appropriate third-party service provider) to submit <ref target="1005-2-b-3-i" reftype="term">prepaid account</ref> agreements to the Bureau under § 1005.19 on Bank's behalf.

              <content>As explained in comment <ref target="1005-19-c-Interp-2" reftype="internal">19(c)-2</ref>, if an issuer provides <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumers</ref> with access to specific information about their individual <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">accounts</ref>, such as making available to <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumers</ref> their electronic <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">account</ref> transaction history, pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii), through a third-party Web site, the issuer is deemed to maintain that Web site for purposes of § 1005.19. Such a Web site is deemed to be maintained by the issuer for purposes of § 1005.19 even where, for example, an unaffiliated entity designs the Web site and owns and maintains the information technology infrastructure that supports the Web site, <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumers</ref> with <ref target="1005-2-b-3-i" reftype="term">prepaid accounts</ref> from multiple issuers can access individual <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">account</ref> information through the same Web site, and the Web site is not labeled, branded, or otherwise held out to the public as belonging to the issuer. A partner institution's Web site is an example of a third-party Web site that may be deemed to be maintained by the issuer for purposes of § 1005.19. For example, Program Manager and Bank work together to issue <ref target="1005-2-b-3-i" reftype="term">prepaid accounts</ref>. Under the § 1005.19(a)(4) definition of issuer, Bank is the issuer of these <ref target="1005-2-b-3-i" reftype="term">prepaid accounts</ref> for purposes of § 1005.19. Bank does not maintain a Web site specifically related to <ref target="1005-2-b-3-i" reftype="term">prepaid accounts</ref>. However, <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumers</ref> can access information about their individual <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">accounts</ref>, such as an electronic <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">account</ref> transaction history, through a Web site maintained by Program Manager. Program Manager designs the Web site and owns and maintains the information technology infrastructure that supports the Web site. The Web site is branded and held out to the public as belonging to Program Manager. Because <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumers</ref> can access information about their individual <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">accounts</ref> through this Web site, the Web site is deemed to be maintained by Bank for purposes of § 1005.19. Bank therefore may comply with § 1005.19(c) or (d)(1) by ensuring that agreements offered by Bank are posted on Program Manager's Web site in accordance with § 1005.19(c) or (d)(1), respectively. Bank need not create and maintain a Web site branded and held out to the public as belonging to Bank in order to comply with § 1005.19(c) and (d) as long as Bank ensures that Program Manager's Web site complies with these sections.</content>

      <title>Section 1005.35 Acts of Agents</title>
      <analysisParagraph>In most cases, remittance transfers are sent through an agent of the remittance transfer provider, such as a convenience store that has contracted with the provider to offer remittance transfer services at that location. EFTA section 919(f)(1) generally makes remittance transfer providers liable for any violation of EFTA section 919 by an agent, authorized delegate, or person affiliated with such provider, when such agent, authorized delegate, or affiliate acts for that remittance transfer provider. EFTA section 919(f)(2) requires the Bureau to prescribe rules to implement appropriate standards or conditions of liability of a remittance transfer provider, including one that acts through its agent or authorized delegate.<footnote ref="85">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See also&lt;/em&gt; § 1005.30(a), which defines the term “agent” for purposes of the rule.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed two alternatives to implement EFTA section 919(f) with respect to acts of agents. Under the first alternative (proposed Alternative A), a remittance transfer provider would be strictly liable for violations of subpart B by an agent when such agent acts for the provider. Under the second alternative (proposed Alternative B), a remittance transfer provider would be liable under the EFTA for violations by an agent acting for the provider, unless the provider establishes and maintains policies and procedures for agent compliance, including appropriate oversight measures, and the provider corrects any violation, to the extent appropriate.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Consumer groups, State regulators, and a Federal Reserve Bank supported proposed Alternative A. These commenters stated that Alternative A would provide the greatest incentives for remittance transfer providers to avoid errors and to oversee and audit their agents. Some argued that proposed Alternative A would be consistent with many State laws, and that adopting proposed Alternative B could disrupt efforts to hold providers to stricter liability standards under State law.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In contrast, industry commenters supported the liability standard set forth in proposed Alternative B. These commenters argued that proposed Alternative B would more appropriately address the unique position of agents in the market, while providing protection for consumers by making them whole for the cost of the remittance transfer. These commenters also stated that proposed Alternative B would create an incentive for providers to take an active role in developing compliance policies and procedures and engaging in agent oversight. These commenters also expressed concern about the liability risks associated with proposed Alternative A for the misconduct or a single agent or isolated violations, and that proposed Alternative A could discourage the use of agents.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Based on comments received and the Bureau's further analysis, the final rule adopts proposed Alternative A in renumbered § 1005.35. The Bureau believes that the approach taken in proposed Alternative A is more consistent with the approach generally taken in other Bureau regulations, including Regulation E. For example, under Regulation E's payroll card rules, a financial institution is required to provide initial payroll card disclosures to a payroll account holder. If, by contractual agreement with the institution, a third-party service provider or the employer agrees to deliver these disclosures on the institution's behalf and fails to do so, the issuing financial institution is nonetheless liable for the violation.<footnote ref="86">12 CFR 1005.18.</footnote>
             Similarly, if an agent at a retail establishment fails to provide the disclosures required by § 1005.31, the remittance transfer provider would be liable. The Bureau also believes that proposed Alternative A provides a greater incentive for providers to monitor their agents' activities and to exercise appropriate supervision and oversight than proposed Alternative B.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One commenter suggested that proposed Alternative A could exculpate an agent from responsibility from its own conduct. However, nothing in the rule shields agents from liability, nor does it prevent providers from requiring specific agent conduct in their contracts or negotiating other contractual liability or indemnification clauses.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>With respect to commenters' concerns about liability risk, EFTA section 919(f)(2) states that enforcement agencies may consider, in any action or other proceeding against a remittance transfer provider, the extent to which the provider had established and maintained policies or procedures for compliance, including policies, procedures, or other appropriate oversight measures designed to assure compliance by an agent or authorized delegate acting for such provider. Thus, enforcement agencies are permitted to tailor any remedies in light of single agent non-compliance or isolated violations.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Several commenters requested further guidance on what it means for an agent to act for a provider. As discussed in the proposal, some agents have a non-exclusive arrangement with several remittance transfer providers, so that a sender may choose from among the remittance transfer providers at that agent location. If a sender chooses to use Provider A to send funds at the agent location, then Provider B would not be liable for the agent's actions in connection with that transaction, because the agent would be acting for Provider A. As noted above regarding the definition of “agent” under § 1005.30(a), the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to defer to State or other applicable law with respect to the relationship between an agent and Provider A.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The final rule also adopts proposed Alternative A's comment 35-1 substantially as proposed. Comment 35-1 explains that remittance transfer providers remain fully responsible for complying with the requirements of this subpart, including, but not limited to, providing the disclosures set forth in § 1005.31 and remedying any errors as set forth in § 1005.33. This is the case even if a remittance transfer provider performs its functions through an agent, and regardless of whether the provider has an agreement with a third party that transfers or otherwise makes funds available to a designated recipient.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(f) Disclosure of Fees and Other Information</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 905(a)(4) requires that financial institutions disclose to consumers, as part of an account's terms and conditions, any charges for EFTs or for the right to make such transfers. Existing § 1005.7(b)(5) implements this requirement by stating that, as part of the initial disclosures, any fees imposed by a financial institution for EFTs or for the right to make transfers must be disclosed.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(f) would have required a financial institution to disclose any fees imposed by a financial institution for EFTs or the right to make such transfers and to include in its initial disclosures given pursuant to § 1005.7(b)(5) all other fees imposed by the financial institution in connection with a prepaid account. For each fee, a financial institution would have been required to disclose the amount of the fee, the conditions, if any, under which the fee may be imposed, waived, or reduced, and, to the extent known, whether any third-party fees may apply. Proposed § 1005.18(f) would have also required a financial institution to include all of the information required to be disclosed in the long form disclosure and be provided in a form substantially similar to proposed Sample Form A-10(e).</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received comments from an industry trade association, issuing banks and a credit union, and program managers on this aspect of the proposal. These commenters generally supported full disclosure of all fees, not just fees related to EFTs. However, some expressed concern that proposed § 1005.18(f)'s inclusion of the long form disclosure would be duplicative, given that prepaid accounts would also be subject to other disclosure requirements under Regulation E as well. Specifically, these commenters argued that requiring financial institutions to provide the short form, long form, and initial disclosures is redundant and would result in information overload and consumer confusion. One issuing credit union urged the Bureau not to require financial institutions to include the long form disclosure in the initial disclosures, while an issuing bank suggested that the Bureau require the long form disclosure be delivered only as part of the initial disclosures. See the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b) above for a more detailed discussion of the comments received on the pre-acquisition long form disclosure generally.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is finalizing proposed § 1005.18(f), renumbered as § 1005.18(f)(1), generally as proposed, with certain modifications for clarity as explained below. The Bureau is adopting this provision pursuant to its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to adjust the requirement in EFTA section 905(a)(4), which is implemented in existing § 1005.7(b)(5), for prepaid accounts, and its authority under section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Bureau believes that disclosure of all fees for prepaid accounts will, consistent with EFTA section 902 and section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, assist consumers' understanding of the terms and conditions of their prepaid accounts, and ensure that the features of prepaid accounts are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with a prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that it is important that the initial account disclosures provided to consumers list all fees that may be imposed in connection with a prepaid account. The Bureau believes that because consumers will likely reference these disclosures throughout their ongoing use of their prepaid accounts, it is important that these disclosures include all relevant fee information, not just those fees related to EFTs. In addition, the Bureau believes that most financial institutions are already disclosing all fees in the terms and conditions accompanying prepaid accounts. Regulation DD, which implements the Truth in Savings Act, requires that initial disclosures for deposit accounts include the amount of any fee that may be imposed in connection with the account (or an explanation of how the fee will be determined) and the conditions under which the fee may be imposed.<footnote ref="507">Regulation DD § 1030.4(b)(4).</footnote>
             Because some prepaid accounts as defined by this final rule may not also constitute accounts as defined under Regulation DD (or the corresponding regulations applicable to credit unions),<footnote ref="508">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 12 CFR part 707.</footnote>
             final § 1005.18(f)(1) in conjunction with the long form disclosure requirements in final § 1005.18(b)(4) will ensure that prepaid account consumers receive fee disclosures that include all fees, not just those related to EFTs or the right to make transfers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.18(f)(1) provides that a financial institution must include, as part of the initial disclosures given pursuant to § 1005.7, all of the information required to be disclosed in its pre-acquisition long form disclosure pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(4). The Bureau is adopting new comment 18(f)-1, which clarifies that a financial institution may, but is not required to, disclose the information required by final § 1005.18(b)(4) in accordance with the formatting, grouping, size and other requirements set forth in final § 1005.18(b) for the long form disclosure as part of its initial disclosures provided pursuant to § 1005.7; a financial institution may choose to do so, however, in order to satisfy other requirements in final § 1005.18.<footnote ref="509">See, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; final § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii) regarding the retail location exception.</footnote>
             The Bureau believes these revisions streamline the proposed language and make clearer the Bureau's intent as to when the long form disclosure itself must be provided.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Relatedly, the Bureau is adopting new § 1005.18(f)(2) to avoid any uncertainty as to when a change-in-terms notice is required. Specifically, this provision makes clear that the change-in-terms notice provisions in § 1005.8(a) apply to any change in a term or condition that is required to be disclosed under § 1005.7 or final § 1005.18(f)(1). New § 1005.18(f)(2) also provides, however, that if a financial institution discloses the amount of a third-party fee in its pre-acquisition long form disclosure pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) and initial disclosures pursuant to final § 1005.18(f)(1), the financial institution is not required to provide a change-in-terms notice solely to reflect a change in that fee amount imposed by the third party.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New § 1005.18(f)(2) also states that if a financial institution provides pursuant to § 1005.18(f)(1) the Regulation Z disclosures required by § 1005.18(b)(4)(vii) for an overdraft credit feature, the financial institution is not required to provide a change-in-terms notice solely to reflect a change in the fees or other terms disclosed therein.<footnote ref="510">The Bureau notes that Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.60(e)(4) requires that the disclosures given pursuant to § 1026.60(e)(1), which are required to be provided when an overdraft credit feature is offered in connection with a prepaid account pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(4)(vii), must be accurate as of the date of printing. A variable APR is accurate if it was in effect within 30 days before printing.</footnote>
             New comment 18(f)-2 explains that the exception provided in new § 1005.18(f)(2) does not extend to any finance charges imposed on the prepaid account as described in final Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61 that are required to be disclosed pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii). This comment also references comment 18(b)(4)(ii)-1. See the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(4)(vii) above for a detailed discussion of this disclosure requirement in the final rule.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>30(h) Third-Party Fees</title>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in detail below in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.31, the Bureau is eliminating the requirement to disclose certain recipient institution fees and to include such fees in the calculation of the disclosed amount to be received by the designated recipient.  In order to differentiate between fees that must be disclosed and included in the calculation of the amount to be received and those that are no longer required to be disclosed and included in such calculation, the Bureau is adopting definitions under § 1005.30(h) for covered third-party fees, required to be calculated and disclosed under subpart B of Regulation E, and non-covered third-party fees, which are not required to be calculated and disclosed.  Section 1005.30(h)(1) defines the term “covered third-party fees” to mean any fee that is imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider, except for non-covered third-party fees as described in § 1005.30(h)(2).  Section 1005.30(h)(2) defines the term “non-covered third-party fees” to mean any fees imposed by the designated recipient's institution for receiving a transfer into an account, except if the institution acts as an agent of the remittance transfer provider.  The rationale underlying the distinctions made in these definitions is discussed further below in the discussion of § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The 2013 Final Rule adds new commentary to 30(h) to explain the scope of these fees.  Drawing from applicable examples of fees imposed by a person other than the remittance transfer provider that were in comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii in the 2012 Final Rule, as well as proposed comments 31(b)(1)-iii and -iv which would have provided additional clarification on how to disclose recipient institution fees, comment 30(h)-1 explains that fees imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider include only those fees that are charged to the designated recipient and are specifically related to the remittance transfer. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Comment 30(h)-1 additionally provides examples of fees that are or are not specifically related to the remittance transfer.  For example, overdraft fees that are imposed by a recipient's bank or funds that are garnished from the proceeds of a remittance transfer to satisfy an unrelated debt are not fees imposed on the remittance transfer because these charges are not specifically related to the remittance transfer.  Comment 30(h)-1 further states that account fees are also not specifically related to a remittance transfer if such fees are merely assessed based on general account activity and not for receiving transfers.  Comment 30(h)-1 additionally clarifies that fees that banks charge one another for handling a remittance transfer or other fees that do not affect the total amount that will be received by the designated recipient are not fees imposed on the remittance transfer. Comment 30(h)-1 also clarifies that fees that specifically relate to a remittance transfer may be structured on a flat per-transaction basis, or may be conditioned on other factors (such as account status or the quantity of remittance transfers received) in addition to the remittance transfer itself. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In addition, the 2013 Final Rule adds new commentary to explain the difference between covered and non-covered third-party fees.  Comment 30(h)-2.i explains that under § 1005.30(h)(1), a covered third-party fee means any fee that is imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider including fees imposed by a designated recipient's institution for receiving a transfer into an account where such institution acts as an agent of the provider for the remittance transfer.  As noted above, the rationale for this distinction is discussed further below in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi).  Comment 30(h)-2.ii provides examples of covered third-party fees including fees imposed on a remittance transfer by intermediary institutions in connection with a wire transfer and fees imposed on a remittance transfer by an agent of the provider at pick-up for receiving the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>With respect to non-covered third-party fees, comment 30(h)-3 explains that a non-covered third-party fee means any fee imposed by the designated recipient's institution for receiving a transfer into an account, unless the institution is acting as an agent of the remittance transfer provider.  It further provides as an example that a fee imposed by the designated recipient's institution for receiving an incoming transfer could be a non-covered third-party fee provided such institution is not acting as the agent of the provider.  In addition, comment 30(h)-3 explains that designated recipient's account in § 1005.30(h)(2) refers only to an asset account, regardless of whether it is a consumer asset account, established for any purpose and held by a bank, savings association, credit union, or equivalent institution.  It does not, however, include a credit card, prepaid card, or a virtual account held by an Internet-based or mobile telephone company that is not a bank, savings association, credit union or equivalent institution.  The rationale for this interpretation is also discussed further below in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). </analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(g) Prepaid Accounts Accessible by Hybrid Prepaid-Credit Cards</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The proposal would have added proposed § 1005.18(g)(1) to set forth timing rules related to when a credit card plan under Regulation Z could be linked to a prepaid account. The proposal also would have added proposed § 1005.18(g)(2) to set forth rules related to the terms applicable to a prepaid account when a credit card plan could be is linked to a prepaid account. For the reasons discussed below, the Bureau has not adopted proposed § 1005.18(g)(1). The Bureau is finalizing proposed § 1005.18(g)(2) as § 1005.18(g) with revisions, as discussed below. For organizational purposes, proposed § 1005.18(g)(2) is discussed first, followed by a discussion of proposed § 1005.18(g)(1).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(g)(2) would have set forth rules related to the terms applicable to a prepaid account when a credit card plan could be linked to a prepaid account. Specifically, proposed § 1005.18(g)(2) would have provided that where a credit card plan subject to Regulation Z may be offered at any point to the consumer with respect to a prepaid account that is accessed by an access device for the prepaid account where the access device is a credit card under Regulation Z, a financial institution that establishes or holds such a prepaid account may not apply different terms and conditions to a consumer's account that do not relate to an extension of credit, carrying a credit balance, or credit availability, depending on whether the consumer elects to link such a credit card plan to the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The proposal would have added proposed comment 18(g)-1 to cross-reference provisions in Regulation Z that would have provided guidance on when a program would have constituted a credit plan under the proposal (<em data-original="E-03">see</em> proposed Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(20) and proposed Regulation Z comment 2(a)(20)-2.ii) and would have provided guidance on when an access device for a prepaid account would have been a credit card under the proposal (<em data-original="E-03">see</em> existing Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(15)(i), and proposed Regulation Z comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.F).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 18(g)-2.i would have provided guidance on the applicability of the restriction in proposed § 1005.18(g)(2). Specifically, proposed comment 18(g)-2.i would have explained that a financial institution may offer different terms on different prepaid account products, where the terms may differ between a prepaid account product where a credit card plan subject to Regulation Z cannot be linked to the prepaid account, and a prepaid account product where a credit card plan subject to Regulation Z can be linked to the prepaid account. Nonetheless, on the prepaid account product where a credit card plan subject to Regulation Z may be offered at any point to the consumer that is accessed by an access device for the prepaid account that is a credit card under Regulation Z, a financial institution that establishes or holds such a prepaid account would have been prohibited from applying different terms and conditions to a consumer's account that do not relate to an extension of credit, carrying a credit balance, or credit availability, depending on whether the consumer elects to link such a credit card plan to the prepaid account. Proposed comment 18(g)-2.ii would have explained that proposed § 1005.18(g)(2) prevents a financial institution from waiving fees or reducing the amount of fees that do not relate to an extension of credit, carrying a credit balance, or credit availability, if the consumer elects to link the prepaid account to a credit card plan.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 18(g)-2.ii would have provided examples of account terms and conditions that would be subject to the restrictions in proposed § 1005.18(g)(2). The proposed examples in comment 18(g)-2.ii would have included fees assessed on the prepaid account that do not relate to an extension of credit, carrying a credit balance, or credit availability, including any transaction fees for transactions that are completely funded by the prepaid account and any one-time or periodic fees imposed for opening or holding a prepaid account. The proposed comment also would have cross-referenced proposed Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(2) and proposed Regulation Z comment 4(b)(2)-1.iii and iv, which would have provided additional guidance on fees that would have related to an extension of credit, carrying a credit balance, or credit availability.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 18(g)-2.iii also would have provided examples of account terms and conditions that are not subject to the restrictions in proposed § 1005.18(g)(2) because these terms and conditions would have related to an extension of credit, carrying a credit balance, or credit availability. The proposed examples would have included (1) fees or charges assessed on the prepaid account applicable to transactions that access the credit card plan subject to Regulation Z, including transaction fees for transactions that either access just the credit card plan, or access both the prepaid account and the credit card plan; and (2) any one-time or periodic fees imposed for the issuance or availability of the credit card plan subject to Regulation Z. Proposed comment 18(g)-2.iv would have provided examples that illustrate the prohibition in proposed § 1005.18(g)(2).</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive any industry comments on this specific aspect of the proposal. One consumer group commenter expressed concern that under proposed comment 18(g)-2.i, a financial institution may offer different terms on two separate card programs, one that has the potential for a credit feature accessed by prepaid card that is a credit card and one that does not. This commenter expressed concern that a financial institution could steer consumers who want to activate such a credit feature to an entirely different prepaid account that has additional fees or other features, including one that is not even offered to the general public, but is only offered to consumers who have asked about or likely to opt in to such a credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>This commenter also noted the partial list of terms and conditions set forth in proposed comment 18(g)-2 where a financial institution under the proposal would not have been able to vary these terms and conditions between consumers who do and do not link a credit feature to the prepaid account that would make the prepaid card into a credit card. The commenter urged the Bureau to add load or transfer fees to this list of fees. The commenter believed that a financial institution should not be permitted to charge a higher or lower fee on the prepaid account for loading funds if the consumer links the credit feature to his or her prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is finalizing proposed § 1005.18(g)(2), renumbered as § 1005.18(g), with revisions for consistency with final Regulation Z §§ 1026.4 and 1026.61.<footnote ref="511">The Regulation Z proposal would have provided that the term “credit card” includes an account number that is not a prepaid card that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan that allows deposits directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. Proposed § 1005.18(g)(2) would have provided that where a credit card plan subject to Regulation Z that is accessed by such an account number may be offered at any point to the consumer, a financial institution that establishes or holds such a prepaid account may not apply different terms and conditions to a consumer's account that do not relate to an extension of credit, carrying a credit balance, or credit availability, depending on whether the consumer elects to link such a credit card plan to the prepaid account. Proposed comment 18(g)-1 would have discussed when these account numbers were credit cards under Regulation Z. Proposed comment 18(g)-2 would have provided guidance how proposed § 1005.18(g)(2) would have applied to credit card plans accessed by these account numbers. For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) below, the final rule does not adopt the provisions related to the account numbers that would have made these account numbers into credit cards under Regulation Z. Thus, provisions in proposed § 1005.18(g)(2) and proposed comments 18(g)-1 and -2 related to these account numbers have not been adopted.</footnote>
             The Bureau is not adopting proposed § 1005.18(g)(1), for reasons discussed below. New § 1005.18(g)(1) provides that except as provided in new § 1005.18(g)(2), with respect to a prepaid account program where consumers may be offered a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined by new Regulation Z § 1026.61, a financial institution must provide to any prepaid account without a covered separate credit feature the same account terms, conditions, and features that it provides on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that have such a credit feature. New § 1005.18(g)(2) provides that a financial institution is not prohibited under new § 1005.18(g)(1) from imposing a higher fee or charge on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card than the amount of a comparable fee or charge that it imposes on any prepaid account in the same prepaid account program that does not have such a credit feature. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) below, new Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) provides that with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61, any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account is a finance charge to the extent that the amount of the fee or charge exceeds comparable fees or charges imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have a credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new Regulation Z § 1026.61 and a credit card under final Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting new § 1005.18(g) pursuant to its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c). In implementing its overdraft opt-in rule under § 1005.17, the Board required that “[a] financial institution shall provide to consumers who do not affirmatively consent to the institution's overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions the same account terms, conditions, and features that it provides to consumers who affirmatively consent, except for the overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions.” <footnote ref="512">See existing § 1005.17(b)(3), which was numbered as § 205.17(b)(3) in the Board's rules.</footnote>
             The Board recognized that without this requirement, “some institutions could otherwise effectively compel the consumer to provide affirmative consent to the institution's payment of overdrafts for ATM and one-time debit card transactions by providing consumers who do not opt in with less favorable terms, conditions, or features than consumers who do opt in.” <footnote ref="513">74 FR 59033, 59044 (Nov. 17, 2009).</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that a similar requirement should be extended here for similar reasons. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z § 1026.12(a)(1) below, a covered separate credit feature may be added to a previously issued prepaid card only upon the consumer's application or specific request and only in compliance with new Regulation Z § 1026.61(c). New Regulation Z § 1026.61(c) requires that with respect to a covered separate credit feature that could be accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card at any point, a card issuer must not do any of the following until 30 days after the prepaid account has been registered: (1) Open a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card; (2) make a solicitation or provide an application to open a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card; or (3) allow an existing credit feature that was opened prior to the consumer obtaining the prepaid account to become a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes some institutions could otherwise effectively compel the consumer to apply for or request a covered separate credit feature as described above by providing consumers who do not make such an application or request with less favorable terms, conditions, or features than consumers who do make such applications or requests. For example, an institution could waive the monthly fee for holding a prepaid account for consumers who apply for or request that a covered separate credit feature be connected to the prepaid account, but not waive the monthly fee for consumers who do not make such an application or request.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is revising the commentary to § 1026.18(g) from the proposal to be consistent with new Regulation Z §§ 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) and 1026.61. New comment 18(g)-1 provides that new Regulation Z § 1026.61 defines the term covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. The Bureau also is adding new comment 18(g)-2.i to provide that new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(5)(ii) defines the term “asset feature.” Under new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(5)(ii), the term “asset feature” means an asset account that is a prepaid account, or an asset subaccount of a prepaid account. New comment 18(g)-2.ii provides that new § 1005.18(g) applies to account terms, conditions, and features that apply to the asset feature of the prepaid account. New § 1005.18(g) does not apply to the account terms, conditions, or features that apply to the covered separate credit feature, regardless of whether it is structured as a separate credit account or as a credit subaccount of the prepaid account that is separate from the asset feature of the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The final rule moves proposed comment 18(g)-2.i to comment 18(g)-3 and revises it to be consistent with new Regulation Z § 1026.61. New comment 18(g)-3 provides that under new § 1005.18(g), a financial institution may offer different terms on different prepaid account programs. For example, the terms may differ between a prepaid account program where a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card is not offered in connection with any prepaid accounts within the prepaid account program, and a prepaid account program where a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card may be offered to some consumers in connection with their prepaid accounts. The Bureau notes concerns expressed by the consumer group commenter that financial institutions could steer consumers who want to activate a credit feature accessible by a prepaid card that is a credit card to an entirely different prepaid account that has additional fees or other features, including one that is not even offered to the general public, but is only offered to consumers who have asked about or likely to opt in to such a credit feature. Nonetheless, at this time, the Bureau retains the flexibility for financial institutions to impose different fees on different prepaid account programs. The Bureau will monitor whether financial institutions are structuring prepaid account programs in an attempt to evade the provisions in new § 1005.18(g).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The final rule moves proposed comment 18(g)-2.ii to new comment 18(g)-4 and revises it to be consistent with new Regulation Z § 1026.61. New comment 18(g)-4 provides that account terms, conditions, and features subject to new § 1005.18(g) include, but are not limited to (1) interest paid on funds deposited into the asset feature of the prepaid account, if any; (2) fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account; <footnote ref="514">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; new comment 18(g)-5 discussed below for additional guidance on how new § 1005.18(g) applies to fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account.</footnote>
             (3) the type of access device provided to the consumer. For instance, an institution may not provide a PIN-only card on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature that is accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, while providing a prepaid card with both PIN and signature-debit functionality for prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program with such a credit feature; (4) minimum balance requirements on the asset feature of the prepaid account; or (5) account features offered in connection with the asset feature of the prepaid account, such as online bill payment services.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The final rule moves proposed comment 18(g)-2.iii through iv to new comment 18(g)-5 and revises it to be consistent with final Regulation Z §§ 1026.4 and 1026.61. New comment 18(g)-5.i provides that with respect to a prepaid account program where consumers may be offered a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined by new Regulation Z § 1026.61, new § 1005.18(g) only permits a financial institution to charge the same or higher fees on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature than the amount of a comparable fee it charges on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have a such a credit feature. This comment explains that new § 1005.18(g) prohibits a financial institution from imposing a lower fee or charge on prepaid accounts with a covered separate credit feature than the amount of a comparable fee or charge it charges on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program without such a credit feature. This comment also states that with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature of a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61, a fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account generally is a finance charge under final Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) to the extent that the amount of the fee or charge exceeds the amount of a comparable fee or charge imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have such a credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail below, new comment 18(g)-5.ii through iv also provides illustrations of how new § 1005.18(g) applies to fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Transaction Fees To Access Prepaid Account Funds</title>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 18(g)-5.ii provides three examples that illustrate how new § 1005.18(g) applies to per transaction fees for each transaction to access funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid account. For example, assume that a consumer has selected a prepaid account program where a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card may be offered. For prepaid accounts without such a credit feature, the financial institution charges $0.50 for each transaction conducted that accesses funds available in the prepaid account. For prepaid accounts with a credit feature, the financial institution also charges $0.50 on the asset feature for each transaction conducted that accesses funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid account. New comment 18(g)-5.ii.A provides that for purposes of new § 1005.18(g), the financial institution is imposing the same fee for each transaction that accesses funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account, regardless of whether the prepaid account has a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. New comment 18(g)-5.ii.A also states that with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature of a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as those terms are defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61, the $0.50 per transaction fee imposed on the asset feature for each transaction that accesses funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid account is not a finance charge under new § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii). This comment cross-references new Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) and comment 4(b)(11)(ii)-1 for a discussion of the definition of finance charge with respect to fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature of a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As set forth in new comment 18(g)-5.ii.B, if in the above example with respect to prepaid accounts with a covered separate credit feature, the financial institution imposes a $1.25 fee for each transaction conducted that accesses funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid account for prepaid accounts with a covered separate credit feature, the financial institution is permitted to charge a higher fee under new § 1005.18(g)(2) on prepaid accounts with a covered separate credit feature than it charges on prepaid accounts without such a credit feature. The $0.75 excess in this example is a finance charge under new Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Nonetheless, as discussed in new comment 18(g)-5.ii.C, if in the above example for prepaid accounts with a covered separate credit feature, the financial institution imposes a $0.25 fee for each transaction conducted that accesses funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid account, the financial institution is in violation of new § 1005.18(g) because it is imposing a lower fee on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature than it imposes on prepaid accounts in the same program without such a credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Fees Related to Covered Separate Credit Features</title>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 18(g)-5.iii and iv provides additional guidance on the type of fees that are considered comparable fees to fees imposed on prepaid accounts for credit extensions from covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards. This guidance is consistent with the guidance provided in Regulation Z comment 4(b)(11)(ii)-1.ii and iii with respect to the definition of finance charge in new Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In developing these rules, as set forth in new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(2)(i)(B) and comment 61(a)(2)-4.ii, the Bureau was conscious that there were two potentially distinct types of credit extensions that could occur on a covered separate credit feature. The first type of credit extension is where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. The second type of credit extension is where a consumer makes a standalone draw or transfer of credit from the covered separate credit feature, outside the course of any transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. For example, a consumer may use the prepaid card at the prepaid account issuer's Web site to load funds from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. Because the two scenarios involve different sets of activities, the range of fees that are likely to be triggered is also likely to be different. New comment 18(g)-5.iii and iv therefore provides separate guidance on the comparable fees under new § 1005.18(g) with respect to each of the two types of credit extensions.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Credit extensions from the covered separate credit feature within the course of a transaction.</em> Comment 18(g)-5.iii provides guidance for credit extensions where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from the covered separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. Specifically, comment 18(g)-5.iii provides that where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from a covered separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing such a transaction, any per transaction fees imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account, including load and transfer fees, with such a credit feature should be compared to the per transaction fees for each transaction to access funds in the asset feature of a prepaid account that is in the same prepaid account program but does not have such a credit feature. Thus, per transaction fees for a transaction that is conducted to load or draw funds into a prepaid account from some other source are not comparable for purposes of new § 1005.18(g).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>To illustrate these principles, comment 18(g)-5.iii sets forth a set of several examples explaining how new § 1005.18(g) applies in situations in which credit is accessed from a covered separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 18(g)-5.iii.A provides the following example: Assume that a prepaid account issuer charges $0.50 on prepaid accounts for each transaction that accesses funds in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature. Also, assume that the prepaid account issuer charges $0.50 per transaction on the asset feature of prepaid accounts in the same prepaid program where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from a covered separate credit feature in the course of a transaction. In this case, for purposes of new § 1005.18(g), the financial institution is imposing the same fee for each transaction it pays, regardless of whether the transaction accesses funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature, or is paid from credit from a covered separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. Also, for purposes of new Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii), the $0.50 per transaction fee imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature is not a finance charge.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As described in new comment 18(g)-5.iii.B, if the prepaid account issuer in the above example instead charged $1.25 on the asset feature of a prepaid account for each transaction where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from the covered separate credit feature in the course of the transaction, the financial institution is permitted to charge the higher fee under new § 1005.18(g) for transactions that access the covered separate credit feature in the course of the transaction than the amount of the comparable fee it charges for each transaction that accesses funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts without such a credit feature. The $0.75 excess is a finance charge under new Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Nonetheless, as discussed in new comment 18(g)-5.iii.C, if in the above example, the financial institution imposes $0.25 on the asset feature of the prepaid account for each transaction conducted where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from the covered separate credit feature in the course of the transaction, the financial institution is in violation of new § 1005.18(g) because it is imposing a lower fee on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature than the amount of the comparable fee it imposes on prepaid accounts in the same program without such a credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 18(g)-5.iii.D provides another example. Assume a prepaid account issuer charges $0.50 on prepaid accounts for each transaction that accesses funds in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature. Assume also that the prepaid account issuer charges both a $0.50 per transaction fee and a $1.25 transfer fee on the asset feature of prepaid accounts in the same prepaid program where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from a covered separate credit feature in the course of a transaction. In this case, both fees charged on a per-transaction basis for the credit transaction (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> a combined fee of $1.75 per transaction) must be compared to the $0.50 per transaction fee to access funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account without a covered separate credit feature. The financial institution is permitted to charge a higher fee under new § 1005.18(g) for transactions that access the covered separate credit feature in the course of the transaction than the amount of the comparable fee it charges for each transaction that accesses funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts without such a credit feature. The $1.25 excess is a finance charge under new Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 18(g)-5.iii.E provides the last in this set of examples. Assume a prepaid account issuer charges $0.50 on prepaid accounts for each transaction that accesses funds in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature, and charges a load fee of $1.25 whenever funds are transferred or loaded from a separate asset account, such as from a deposit account via a debit card, in the course of a transaction on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature. Assume also that the prepaid account issuer charges both a $0.50 per transaction fee and a $1.25 transfer fee on the asset feature of prepaid accounts in the same prepaid program where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from a covered separate credit feature in the course of a transaction. In this case, both fees charged on a per-transaction basis for the credit transaction (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> a combined fee of $1.75 per transaction) must be compared to the per transaction fee (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the fee of $0.50) to access funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts on a prepaid account without a covered separate credit feature. Per transaction fees for a transaction that is conducted by drawing funds into a prepaid account from some other source (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the fee of $1.25) are not comparable for purposes of new § 1005.18(g). The financial institution is permitted to charge a higher fee under new § 1005.18(g) for transactions that access the covered separate credit feature in the course of the transaction than the amount of the comparable fee it charges for each transaction to access funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts without such a credit feature. The $1.25 excess is a finance charge under new Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) below, the Bureau believes that the above standard for determining comparable fees with respect to fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of prepaid accounts accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards will help prevent evasion of the rules set forth in the final rule with respect to hybrid prepaid-credit cards. The Bureau believes that many prepaid cardholders who wish to use covered separate credit features may not have other deposit accounts or savings accounts from which they can transfer funds to prevent an overdraft on the prepaid account in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers to prevent an overdraft on the prepaid account. As a result, the Bureau does not believe that a per transaction fee for credit drawn or transferred from a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card during the course of a transaction should be allowed to be compared with a per transaction fee for a service that many prepaid cardholders who wish to use covered separate credit features may not be able to use. For this reason, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to limit the comparable fee in this case to per transaction fees imposed on prepaid accounts for transactions that access funds in the prepaid account in the same prepaid account program that does not have a covered separate credit feature. All prepaid accountholders can use prepaid accounts to make transactions that access available funds in the prepaid account, so these types of transactions will be available to all prepaid accountholders.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Credit extensions from a covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction.</em> Comment 18(g)-5.iv provides guidance for credit extensions where a consumer draws or transfers credit from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. For example, a consumer may use the prepaid card at the prepaid account issuer's Web site to load funds from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 18(g)-5.iv provides that load or transfer fees imposed for draws or transfers of credit from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction are compared only with fees, if any, to load funds as a direct deposit of salary from an employer or a direct deposit of government benefits that are charged on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature. Fees imposed on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature for a one-time load or transfer of funds from a separate asset account or from a non-covered separate credit feature are not comparable for purposes of new § 1005.18(g).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 18(g)-5.iv provides examples to illustrate this guidance. The first example set forth in comment 18(g)-5.iv.A relates to loads to transfer funds from a non-covered separate credit feature. Specifically, assume a prepaid account issuer charges a $1.25 load fee to transfer funds from a non-covered separate credit feature, such as a non-covered separate credit card account, into prepaid accounts that do not have a covered separate credit feature and does not charge a fee for a direct deposit of salary from an employer or a direct deposit of government benefits on those prepaid accounts. Assume the prepaid account issuer charges $1.25 on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature to load funds from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction. In this case, the load or transfer fees imposed for draws or transfers of credit from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the fee of $1.25) are compared with the fees to load funds as a direct deposit of salary from an employer or a direct deposit of government benefits that are charged on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the fee of $0). Fees imposed on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature for a one-time load or transfer of funds from a separate asset account (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the fee of $1.25) is not comparable for purposes of new § 1005.18(g). In this case, the financial institution is permitted to charge a higher fee under new § 1005.18(g) for transactions that access the covered separate credit feature on prepaid accounts with a credit feature than the amount of the comparable fee it charges on prepaid accounts in the same program without such a credit feature. The $1.25 fee imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account with a separate credit feature is a finance charge under new Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As set forth in comment 18(g)-5.iv.B, a second example relates to a one-time transfer of funds from a separate asset account. In this second example, assume that a prepaid account issuer charges a $1.25 load fee for a one-time transfer of funds from a separate asset account, such as from a deposit account via a debit card, to a prepaid account without a covered separate credit feature and does not charge a fee for a direct deposit of salary from an employer or a direct deposit of government benefits on those prepaid accounts. Assume the prepaid account issuer charges $1.25 on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature to load funds from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction. In this case, the load or transfer fees imposed for draws or transfers of credit from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the fee of $1.25) are compared with the fees to load funds as a direct deposit of salary from an employer or a direct deposit of government benefits that are charged on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the fee of $0). Fees imposed on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature for a one-time load or transfer of funds from a separate asset account (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the fee of $1.25) is not comparable for purposes of new § 1005.18(g). In this case, the financial institution is permitted to charge a higher fee under new § 1005.18(g) for transactions that access the covered separate credit feature on prepaid accounts with a credit feature than the amount of the comparable fee it charges on prepaid accounts in the same program without such a credit feature. The $1.25 fee imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature is a finance charge under new Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) below, the Bureau believes that many prepaid accountholders who wish to use covered separate credit features may not have other asset accounts, such as checking accounts or savings accounts, or other credit accounts, from which they can draw or transfer asset funds or credit for deposit into the prepaid account outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. As a result, the Bureau does not believe that load or transfer fees for credit from a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card outside the course of a transaction should be allowed to be compared with a load or transfer fees from an asset account, or non-covered separate credit feature, outside the course of a transaction. For this reason, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to limit the comparable fee in this case to fees, if any, to load funds as a direct deposit of salary from an employer or a direct deposit of government benefits that are charged on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature. The Bureau believes that such direct deposit methods commonly are offered on most types of prepaid accounts and that most prepaid accountholders who wish to use covered separate credit feature are able to avail themselves of these methods.<footnote ref="515">The Bureau understands that prepaid account issuers currently offering overdraft services condition consumer eligibility on receipt of a regularly-occurring direct deposit in excess of a specified threshold.</footnote>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The proposal would have added proposed § 1005.18(g)(1) to set forth timing rules related to when a credit card plan under Regulation Z could be linked to a prepaid account. The proposal also would have added proposed § 1005.18(g)(2) to set forth rules related to the terms applicable to a prepaid account when a credit card plan could be is linked to a prepaid account. For the reasons discussed below, the Bureau has not adopted proposed § 1005.18(g)(1). The Bureau is finalizing proposed § 1005.18(g)(2) as § 1005.18(g) with revisions, as discussed below. For organizational purposes, proposed § 1005.18(g)(2) is discussed first, followed by a discussion of proposed § 1005.18(g)(1).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(g)(2) would have set forth rules related to the terms applicable to a prepaid account when a credit card plan could be linked to a prepaid account. Specifically, proposed § 1005.18(g)(2) would have provided that where a credit card plan subject to Regulation Z may be offered at any point to the consumer with respect to a prepaid account that is accessed by an access device for the prepaid account where the access device is a credit card under Regulation Z, a financial institution that establishes or holds such a prepaid account may not apply different terms and conditions to a consumer's account that do not relate to an extension of credit, carrying a credit balance, or credit availability, depending on whether the consumer elects to link such a credit card plan to the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The proposal would have added proposed comment 18(g)-1 to cross-reference provisions in Regulation Z that would have provided guidance on when a program would have constituted a credit plan under the proposal (<em data-original="E-03">see</em> proposed Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(20) and proposed Regulation Z comment 2(a)(20)-2.ii) and would have provided guidance on when an access device for a prepaid account would have been a credit card under the proposal (<em data-original="E-03">see</em> existing Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(15)(i), and proposed Regulation Z comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.F).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 18(g)-2.i would have provided guidance on the applicability of the restriction in proposed § 1005.18(g)(2). Specifically, proposed comment 18(g)-2.i would have explained that a financial institution may offer different terms on different prepaid account products, where the terms may differ between a prepaid account product where a credit card plan subject to Regulation Z cannot be linked to the prepaid account, and a prepaid account product where a credit card plan subject to Regulation Z can be linked to the prepaid account. Nonetheless, on the prepaid account product where a credit card plan subject to Regulation Z may be offered at any point to the consumer that is accessed by an access device for the prepaid account that is a credit card under Regulation Z, a financial institution that establishes or holds such a prepaid account would have been prohibited from applying different terms and conditions to a consumer's account that do not relate to an extension of credit, carrying a credit balance, or credit availability, depending on whether the consumer elects to link such a credit card plan to the prepaid account. Proposed comment 18(g)-2.ii would have explained that proposed § 1005.18(g)(2) prevents a financial institution from waiving fees or reducing the amount of fees that do not relate to an extension of credit, carrying a credit balance, or credit availability, if the consumer elects to link the prepaid account to a credit card plan.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 18(g)-2.ii would have provided examples of account terms and conditions that would be subject to the restrictions in proposed § 1005.18(g)(2). The proposed examples in comment 18(g)-2.ii would have included fees assessed on the prepaid account that do not relate to an extension of credit, carrying a credit balance, or credit availability, including any transaction fees for transactions that are completely funded by the prepaid account and any one-time or periodic fees imposed for opening or holding a prepaid account. The proposed comment also would have cross-referenced proposed Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(2) and proposed Regulation Z comment 4(b)(2)-1.iii and iv, which would have provided additional guidance on fees that would have related to an extension of credit, carrying a credit balance, or credit availability.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 18(g)-2.iii also would have provided examples of account terms and conditions that are not subject to the restrictions in proposed § 1005.18(g)(2) because these terms and conditions would have related to an extension of credit, carrying a credit balance, or credit availability. The proposed examples would have included (1) fees or charges assessed on the prepaid account applicable to transactions that access the credit card plan subject to Regulation Z, including transaction fees for transactions that either access just the credit card plan, or access both the prepaid account and the credit card plan; and (2) any one-time or periodic fees imposed for the issuance or availability of the credit card plan subject to Regulation Z. Proposed comment 18(g)-2.iv would have provided examples that illustrate the prohibition in proposed § 1005.18(g)(2).</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive any industry comments on this specific aspect of the proposal. One consumer group commenter expressed concern that under proposed comment 18(g)-2.i, a financial institution may offer different terms on two separate card programs, one that has the potential for a credit feature accessed by prepaid card that is a credit card and one that does not. This commenter expressed concern that a financial institution could steer consumers who want to activate such a credit feature to an entirely different prepaid account that has additional fees or other features, including one that is not even offered to the general public, but is only offered to consumers who have asked about or likely to opt in to such a credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>This commenter also noted the partial list of terms and conditions set forth in proposed comment 18(g)-2 where a financial institution under the proposal would not have been able to vary these terms and conditions between consumers who do and do not link a credit feature to the prepaid account that would make the prepaid card into a credit card. The commenter urged the Bureau to add load or transfer fees to this list of fees. The commenter believed that a financial institution should not be permitted to charge a higher or lower fee on the prepaid account for loading funds if the consumer links the credit feature to his or her prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is finalizing proposed § 1005.18(g)(2), renumbered as § 1005.18(g), with revisions for consistency with final Regulation Z §§ 1026.4 and 1026.61.<footnote ref="511">The Regulation Z proposal would have provided that the term “credit card” includes an account number that is not a prepaid card that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan that allows deposits directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. Proposed § 1005.18(g)(2) would have provided that where a credit card plan subject to Regulation Z that is accessed by such an account number may be offered at any point to the consumer, a financial institution that establishes or holds such a prepaid account may not apply different terms and conditions to a consumer's account that do not relate to an extension of credit, carrying a credit balance, or credit availability, depending on whether the consumer elects to link such a credit card plan to the prepaid account. Proposed comment 18(g)-1 would have discussed when these account numbers were credit cards under Regulation Z. Proposed comment 18(g)-2 would have provided guidance how proposed § 1005.18(g)(2) would have applied to credit card plans accessed by these account numbers. For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) below, the final rule does not adopt the provisions related to the account numbers that would have made these account numbers into credit cards under Regulation Z. Thus, provisions in proposed § 1005.18(g)(2) and proposed comments 18(g)-1 and -2 related to these account numbers have not been adopted.</footnote>
             The Bureau is not adopting proposed § 1005.18(g)(1), for reasons discussed below. New § 1005.18(g)(1) provides that except as provided in new § 1005.18(g)(2), with respect to a prepaid account program where consumers may be offered a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined by new Regulation Z § 1026.61, a financial institution must provide to any prepaid account without a covered separate credit feature the same account terms, conditions, and features that it provides on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that have such a credit feature. New § 1005.18(g)(2) provides that a financial institution is not prohibited under new § 1005.18(g)(1) from imposing a higher fee or charge on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card than the amount of a comparable fee or charge that it imposes on any prepaid account in the same prepaid account program that does not have such a credit feature. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) below, new Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) provides that with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61, any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account is a finance charge to the extent that the amount of the fee or charge exceeds comparable fees or charges imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have a credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new Regulation Z § 1026.61 and a credit card under final Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting new § 1005.18(g) pursuant to its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c). In implementing its overdraft opt-in rule under § 1005.17, the Board required that “[a] financial institution shall provide to consumers who do not affirmatively consent to the institution's overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions the same account terms, conditions, and features that it provides to consumers who affirmatively consent, except for the overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions.” <footnote ref="512">See existing § 1005.17(b)(3), which was numbered as § 205.17(b)(3) in the Board's rules.</footnote>
             The Board recognized that without this requirement, “some institutions could otherwise effectively compel the consumer to provide affirmative consent to the institution's payment of overdrafts for ATM and one-time debit card transactions by providing consumers who do not opt in with less favorable terms, conditions, or features than consumers who do opt in.” <footnote ref="513">74 FR 59033, 59044 (Nov. 17, 2009).</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that a similar requirement should be extended here for similar reasons. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z § 1026.12(a)(1) below, a covered separate credit feature may be added to a previously issued prepaid card only upon the consumer's application or specific request and only in compliance with new Regulation Z § 1026.61(c). New Regulation Z § 1026.61(c) requires that with respect to a covered separate credit feature that could be accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card at any point, a card issuer must not do any of the following until 30 days after the prepaid account has been registered: (1) Open a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card; (2) make a solicitation or provide an application to open a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card; or (3) allow an existing credit feature that was opened prior to the consumer obtaining the prepaid account to become a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes some institutions could otherwise effectively compel the consumer to apply for or request a covered separate credit feature as described above by providing consumers who do not make such an application or request with less favorable terms, conditions, or features than consumers who do make such applications or requests. For example, an institution could waive the monthly fee for holding a prepaid account for consumers who apply for or request that a covered separate credit feature be connected to the prepaid account, but not waive the monthly fee for consumers who do not make such an application or request.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is revising the commentary to § 1026.18(g) from the proposal to be consistent with new Regulation Z §§ 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) and 1026.61. New comment 18(g)-1 provides that new Regulation Z § 1026.61 defines the term covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. The Bureau also is adding new comment 18(g)-2.i to provide that new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(5)(ii) defines the term “asset feature.” Under new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(5)(ii), the term “asset feature” means an asset account that is a prepaid account, or an asset subaccount of a prepaid account. New comment 18(g)-2.ii provides that new § 1005.18(g) applies to account terms, conditions, and features that apply to the asset feature of the prepaid account. New § 1005.18(g) does not apply to the account terms, conditions, or features that apply to the covered separate credit feature, regardless of whether it is structured as a separate credit account or as a credit subaccount of the prepaid account that is separate from the asset feature of the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The final rule moves proposed comment 18(g)-2.i to comment 18(g)-3 and revises it to be consistent with new Regulation Z § 1026.61. New comment 18(g)-3 provides that under new § 1005.18(g), a financial institution may offer different terms on different prepaid account programs. For example, the terms may differ between a prepaid account program where a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card is not offered in connection with any prepaid accounts within the prepaid account program, and a prepaid account program where a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card may be offered to some consumers in connection with their prepaid accounts. The Bureau notes concerns expressed by the consumer group commenter that financial institutions could steer consumers who want to activate a credit feature accessible by a prepaid card that is a credit card to an entirely different prepaid account that has additional fees or other features, including one that is not even offered to the general public, but is only offered to consumers who have asked about or likely to opt in to such a credit feature. Nonetheless, at this time, the Bureau retains the flexibility for financial institutions to impose different fees on different prepaid account programs. The Bureau will monitor whether financial institutions are structuring prepaid account programs in an attempt to evade the provisions in new § 1005.18(g).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The final rule moves proposed comment 18(g)-2.ii to new comment 18(g)-4 and revises it to be consistent with new Regulation Z § 1026.61. New comment 18(g)-4 provides that account terms, conditions, and features subject to new § 1005.18(g) include, but are not limited to (1) interest paid on funds deposited into the asset feature of the prepaid account, if any; (2) fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account; <footnote ref="514">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; new comment 18(g)-5 discussed below for additional guidance on how new § 1005.18(g) applies to fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account.</footnote>
             (3) the type of access device provided to the consumer. For instance, an institution may not provide a PIN-only card on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature that is accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, while providing a prepaid card with both PIN and signature-debit functionality for prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program with such a credit feature; (4) minimum balance requirements on the asset feature of the prepaid account; or (5) account features offered in connection with the asset feature of the prepaid account, such as online bill payment services.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The final rule moves proposed comment 18(g)-2.iii through iv to new comment 18(g)-5 and revises it to be consistent with final Regulation Z §§ 1026.4 and 1026.61. New comment 18(g)-5.i provides that with respect to a prepaid account program where consumers may be offered a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined by new Regulation Z § 1026.61, new § 1005.18(g) only permits a financial institution to charge the same or higher fees on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature than the amount of a comparable fee it charges on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have a such a credit feature. This comment explains that new § 1005.18(g) prohibits a financial institution from imposing a lower fee or charge on prepaid accounts with a covered separate credit feature than the amount of a comparable fee or charge it charges on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program without such a credit feature. This comment also states that with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature of a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61, a fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account generally is a finance charge under final Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) to the extent that the amount of the fee or charge exceeds the amount of a comparable fee or charge imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have such a credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail below, new comment 18(g)-5.ii through iv also provides illustrations of how new § 1005.18(g) applies to fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Transaction Fees To Access Prepaid Account Funds</title>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 18(g)-5.ii provides three examples that illustrate how new § 1005.18(g) applies to per transaction fees for each transaction to access funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid account. For example, assume that a consumer has selected a prepaid account program where a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card may be offered. For prepaid accounts without such a credit feature, the financial institution charges $0.50 for each transaction conducted that accesses funds available in the prepaid account. For prepaid accounts with a credit feature, the financial institution also charges $0.50 on the asset feature for each transaction conducted that accesses funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid account. New comment 18(g)-5.ii.A provides that for purposes of new § 1005.18(g), the financial institution is imposing the same fee for each transaction that accesses funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account, regardless of whether the prepaid account has a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. New comment 18(g)-5.ii.A also states that with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature of a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as those terms are defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61, the $0.50 per transaction fee imposed on the asset feature for each transaction that accesses funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid account is not a finance charge under new § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii). This comment cross-references new Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) and comment 4(b)(11)(ii)-1 for a discussion of the definition of finance charge with respect to fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature of a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As set forth in new comment 18(g)-5.ii.B, if in the above example with respect to prepaid accounts with a covered separate credit feature, the financial institution imposes a $1.25 fee for each transaction conducted that accesses funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid account for prepaid accounts with a covered separate credit feature, the financial institution is permitted to charge a higher fee under new § 1005.18(g)(2) on prepaid accounts with a covered separate credit feature than it charges on prepaid accounts without such a credit feature. The $0.75 excess in this example is a finance charge under new Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Nonetheless, as discussed in new comment 18(g)-5.ii.C, if in the above example for prepaid accounts with a covered separate credit feature, the financial institution imposes a $0.25 fee for each transaction conducted that accesses funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid account, the financial institution is in violation of new § 1005.18(g) because it is imposing a lower fee on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature than it imposes on prepaid accounts in the same program without such a credit feature.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Fees Related to Covered Separate Credit Features</title>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 18(g)-5.iii and iv provides additional guidance on the type of fees that are considered comparable fees to fees imposed on prepaid accounts for credit extensions from covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards. This guidance is consistent with the guidance provided in Regulation Z comment 4(b)(11)(ii)-1.ii and iii with respect to the definition of finance charge in new Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In developing these rules, as set forth in new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(2)(i)(B) and comment 61(a)(2)-4.ii, the Bureau was conscious that there were two potentially distinct types of credit extensions that could occur on a covered separate credit feature. The first type of credit extension is where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. The second type of credit extension is where a consumer makes a standalone draw or transfer of credit from the covered separate credit feature, outside the course of any transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. For example, a consumer may use the prepaid card at the prepaid account issuer's Web site to load funds from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. Because the two scenarios involve different sets of activities, the range of fees that are likely to be triggered is also likely to be different. New comment 18(g)-5.iii and iv therefore provides separate guidance on the comparable fees under new § 1005.18(g) with respect to each of the two types of credit extensions.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Credit extensions from the covered separate credit feature within the course of a transaction.</em> Comment 18(g)-5.iii provides guidance for credit extensions where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from the covered separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. Specifically, comment 18(g)-5.iii provides that where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from a covered separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing such a transaction, any per transaction fees imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account, including load and transfer fees, with such a credit feature should be compared to the per transaction fees for each transaction to access funds in the asset feature of a prepaid account that is in the same prepaid account program but does not have such a credit feature. Thus, per transaction fees for a transaction that is conducted to load or draw funds into a prepaid account from some other source are not comparable for purposes of new § 1005.18(g).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>To illustrate these principles, comment 18(g)-5.iii sets forth a set of several examples explaining how new § 1005.18(g) applies in situations in which credit is accessed from a covered separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 18(g)-5.iii.A provides the following example: Assume that a prepaid account issuer charges $0.50 on prepaid accounts for each transaction that accesses funds in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature. Also, assume that the prepaid account issuer charges $0.50 per transaction on the asset feature of prepaid accounts in the same prepaid program where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from a covered separate credit feature in the course of a transaction. In this case, for purposes of new § 1005.18(g), the financial institution is imposing the same fee for each transaction it pays, regardless of whether the transaction accesses funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature, or is paid from credit from a covered separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. Also, for purposes of new Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii), the $0.50 per transaction fee imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature is not a finance charge.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As described in new comment 18(g)-5.iii.B, if the prepaid account issuer in the above example instead charged $1.25 on the asset feature of a prepaid account for each transaction where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from the covered separate credit feature in the course of the transaction, the financial institution is permitted to charge the higher fee under new § 1005.18(g) for transactions that access the covered separate credit feature in the course of the transaction than the amount of the comparable fee it charges for each transaction that accesses funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts without such a credit feature. The $0.75 excess is a finance charge under new Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Nonetheless, as discussed in new comment 18(g)-5.iii.C, if in the above example, the financial institution imposes $0.25 on the asset feature of the prepaid account for each transaction conducted where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from the covered separate credit feature in the course of the transaction, the financial institution is in violation of new § 1005.18(g) because it is imposing a lower fee on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature than the amount of the comparable fee it imposes on prepaid accounts in the same program without such a credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 18(g)-5.iii.D provides another example. Assume a prepaid account issuer charges $0.50 on prepaid accounts for each transaction that accesses funds in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature. Assume also that the prepaid account issuer charges both a $0.50 per transaction fee and a $1.25 transfer fee on the asset feature of prepaid accounts in the same prepaid program where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from a covered separate credit feature in the course of a transaction. In this case, both fees charged on a per-transaction basis for the credit transaction (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> a combined fee of $1.75 per transaction) must be compared to the $0.50 per transaction fee to access funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account without a covered separate credit feature. The financial institution is permitted to charge a higher fee under new § 1005.18(g) for transactions that access the covered separate credit feature in the course of the transaction than the amount of the comparable fee it charges for each transaction that accesses funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts without such a credit feature. The $1.25 excess is a finance charge under new Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 18(g)-5.iii.E provides the last in this set of examples. Assume a prepaid account issuer charges $0.50 on prepaid accounts for each transaction that accesses funds in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature, and charges a load fee of $1.25 whenever funds are transferred or loaded from a separate asset account, such as from a deposit account via a debit card, in the course of a transaction on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature. Assume also that the prepaid account issuer charges both a $0.50 per transaction fee and a $1.25 transfer fee on the asset feature of prepaid accounts in the same prepaid program where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from a covered separate credit feature in the course of a transaction. In this case, both fees charged on a per-transaction basis for the credit transaction (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> a combined fee of $1.75 per transaction) must be compared to the per transaction fee (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the fee of $0.50) to access funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts on a prepaid account without a covered separate credit feature. Per transaction fees for a transaction that is conducted by drawing funds into a prepaid account from some other source (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the fee of $1.25) are not comparable for purposes of new § 1005.18(g). The financial institution is permitted to charge a higher fee under new § 1005.18(g) for transactions that access the covered separate credit feature in the course of the transaction than the amount of the comparable fee it charges for each transaction to access funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts without such a credit feature. The $1.25 excess is a finance charge under new Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) below, the Bureau believes that the above standard for determining comparable fees with respect to fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of prepaid accounts accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards will help prevent evasion of the rules set forth in the final rule with respect to hybrid prepaid-credit cards. The Bureau believes that many prepaid cardholders who wish to use covered separate credit features may not have other deposit accounts or savings accounts from which they can transfer funds to prevent an overdraft on the prepaid account in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers to prevent an overdraft on the prepaid account. As a result, the Bureau does not believe that a per transaction fee for credit drawn or transferred from a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card during the course of a transaction should be allowed to be compared with a per transaction fee for a service that many prepaid cardholders who wish to use covered separate credit features may not be able to use. For this reason, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to limit the comparable fee in this case to per transaction fees imposed on prepaid accounts for transactions that access funds in the prepaid account in the same prepaid account program that does not have a covered separate credit feature. All prepaid accountholders can use prepaid accounts to make transactions that access available funds in the prepaid account, so these types of transactions will be available to all prepaid accountholders.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Credit extensions from a covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction.</em> Comment 18(g)-5.iv provides guidance for credit extensions where a consumer draws or transfers credit from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. For example, a consumer may use the prepaid card at the prepaid account issuer's Web site to load funds from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 18(g)-5.iv provides that load or transfer fees imposed for draws or transfers of credit from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction are compared only with fees, if any, to load funds as a direct deposit of salary from an employer or a direct deposit of government benefits that are charged on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature. Fees imposed on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature for a one-time load or transfer of funds from a separate asset account or from a non-covered separate credit feature are not comparable for purposes of new § 1005.18(g).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 18(g)-5.iv provides examples to illustrate this guidance. The first example set forth in comment 18(g)-5.iv.A relates to loads to transfer funds from a non-covered separate credit feature. Specifically, assume a prepaid account issuer charges a $1.25 load fee to transfer funds from a non-covered separate credit feature, such as a non-covered separate credit card account, into prepaid accounts that do not have a covered separate credit feature and does not charge a fee for a direct deposit of salary from an employer or a direct deposit of government benefits on those prepaid accounts. Assume the prepaid account issuer charges $1.25 on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature to load funds from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction. In this case, the load or transfer fees imposed for draws or transfers of credit from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the fee of $1.25) are compared with the fees to load funds as a direct deposit of salary from an employer or a direct deposit of government benefits that are charged on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the fee of $0). Fees imposed on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature for a one-time load or transfer of funds from a separate asset account (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the fee of $1.25) is not comparable for purposes of new § 1005.18(g). In this case, the financial institution is permitted to charge a higher fee under new § 1005.18(g) for transactions that access the covered separate credit feature on prepaid accounts with a credit feature than the amount of the comparable fee it charges on prepaid accounts in the same program without such a credit feature. The $1.25 fee imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account with a separate credit feature is a finance charge under new Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As set forth in comment 18(g)-5.iv.B, a second example relates to a one-time transfer of funds from a separate asset account. In this second example, assume that a prepaid account issuer charges a $1.25 load fee for a one-time transfer of funds from a separate asset account, such as from a deposit account via a debit card, to a prepaid account without a covered separate credit feature and does not charge a fee for a direct deposit of salary from an employer or a direct deposit of government benefits on those prepaid accounts. Assume the prepaid account issuer charges $1.25 on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature to load funds from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction. In this case, the load or transfer fees imposed for draws or transfers of credit from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the fee of $1.25) are compared with the fees to load funds as a direct deposit of salary from an employer or a direct deposit of government benefits that are charged on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the fee of $0). Fees imposed on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature for a one-time load or transfer of funds from a separate asset account (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the fee of $1.25) is not comparable for purposes of new § 1005.18(g). In this case, the financial institution is permitted to charge a higher fee under new § 1005.18(g) for transactions that access the covered separate credit feature on prepaid accounts with a credit feature than the amount of the comparable fee it charges on prepaid accounts in the same program without such a credit feature. The $1.25 fee imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature is a finance charge under new Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) below, the Bureau believes that many prepaid accountholders who wish to use covered separate credit features may not have other asset accounts, such as checking accounts or savings accounts, or other credit accounts, from which they can draw or transfer asset funds or credit for deposit into the prepaid account outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. As a result, the Bureau does not believe that load or transfer fees for credit from a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card outside the course of a transaction should be allowed to be compared with a load or transfer fees from an asset account, or non-covered separate credit feature, outside the course of a transaction. For this reason, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to limit the comparable fee in this case to fees, if any, to load funds as a direct deposit of salary from an employer or a direct deposit of government benefits that are charged on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature. The Bureau believes that such direct deposit methods commonly are offered on most types of prepaid accounts and that most prepaid accountholders who wish to use covered separate credit feature are able to avail themselves of these methods.<footnote ref="515">The Bureau understands that prepaid account issuers currently offering overdraft services condition consumer eligibility on receipt of a regularly-occurring direct deposit in excess of a specified threshold.</footnote>

      <title>18(d) Modified Disclosure Requirements</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to extend the requirements in existing § 1005.18(c)(1) related to initial disclosures regarding access to account information and error resolution, and in existing § 1005.18(c)(2) regarding annual error resolution notices, to all prepaid accounts. The Bureau proposed to renumber existing § 1005.18(c)(1) and (2) as § 1005.18(d)(1) and (2) for organizational purposes and to separate the modified requirements related to disclosures in existing § 1005.18(c)(1) and (2) from the modifications for limitations on liability and error resolution requirements in existing § 1005.18(c)(3) and (4).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 905(a)(7) requires financial institutions to provide consumers with an annual error resolution notice. The annual error resolution notice provision for payroll card accounts in existing § 1005.18(c)(2) permits a financial institution, in lieu of providing an annual notice concerning error resolution, to include an abbreviated error resolution notice on or with each electronic and written history provided in accordance with existing § 1005.18(b)(1). Financial institutions providing periodic statements are similarly permitted to provide an abbreviated error resolution notice on or with each periodic statement pursuant to § 1005.8(b). In preparing the proposal, the Bureau considered limiting the requirement to provide annual error resolution notices to only active and registered prepaid accounts, but given this existing alternative for providing an abbreviated notice with electronic and written history, the Bureau did not believe such a modification was necessary.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau requested comment on the application of these provisions for initial disclosures regarding access to account information and error resolution, and annual error resolution notices, to all prepaid accounts. Specifically, the Bureau sought comment on whether financial institutions would face particular challenges in providing annual error resolution notices to all prepaid consumers, as well as whether it should have required that annual error resolution notices be sent for prepaid accounts in certain circumstances, such as those accounts for which a consumer has not accessed an electronic history or requested in written history in an entire calendar year and thus would not have received any error resolution notice during the course of the year.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Few commenters submitted feedback on this portion of the proposal. An issuing bank urged the Bureau to shorten the written error resolution notice it would be required to provide consumers by proposed § 1005.18(d)(1)(ii), and to permit financial institutions to post the complete notice electronically instead of providing it in writing. The commenter argued that the initial disclosures were generally too lengthy, potentially leading to consumer inattention and confusion. A consumer group commenter similarly urged the Bureau to simplify the notice and require that it be distributed as a separate, stand-alone form.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>With respect to the annual error resolution notice and the alternative in proposed § 1005.18(d)(2), several industry commenters, including trade associations, a program manager, and a payment processor, argued that the Bureau should eliminate the annual error resolution requirement, or narrow it to only apply to active and/or registered prepaid accountholders. These commenters argued that consumers do not want to receive unsolicited paper notices. A trade association representing credit unions argued that both the annual and periodic notices were unnecessary since the terms of these notices remain static from year to year and could more simply be incorporated into the cardholder agreement. A consumer group commenter argued by contrast that the Bureau should retain a requirement to provide a written annual notice for dormant accounts.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is finalizing § 1005.18(d) as proposed, with minor revisions for clarity and consistency. To further the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account users, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to adopt an adjustment to the error resolution notice requirement of EFTA section 905(a)(7), to permit notices for prepaid accounts as described in final § 1005.18(d)(2), in order to facilitate compliance with error resolution requirements.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has considered the modifications suggested by commenters but declines to adopt tailored requirements for how and when financial institutions must disclose information about consumers' rights related to error resolution, limited liability, and access to account information for prepaid accounts. The Bureau continues to believe that it is appropriate to apply to all prepaid accounts the account access and error resolution disclosure requirements that currently apply to payroll card accounts. The Bureau believes that the existing regime strikes an appropriate balance by providing consumers with enough information to know about and exercise their rights without overwhelming them with more information than they can process or put to use.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>32(b)(1)(ii) Method by Which Transactions are Made in the Recipient Country</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.32(b)(2) allowed estimates to be provided for the exchange rate, transfer amount, other fees and taxes, and total to recipient disclosures (adopted as § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) through (vii) above), if a remittance transfer provider cannot determine exact amounts because the method by which transactions are made in the recipient country does not permit such a determination.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Based on the Board's outreach and interpretation of the statute, the Board stated its belief that the exception for methods by which transactions are made in the recipient country under proposed § 205.32(b)(2) was intended to permit estimates for certain international ACH transactions. Specifically, the Board interpreted the exception under § 205.32(b)(2) to apply to remittances sent via international ACH on terms negotiated by the government of the United States and the government of a recipient country where the exchange rate is set after the transfer is sent. Accordingly, proposed comment 32(b)(2)-1 stated that the “method by which transactions are made in the recipient country” does not permit a remittance transfer provider to determine exact amounts when transactions are sent via international ACH on terms negotiated between the United States government and the recipient country's government, under which the exchange rate is set by the recipient country's central bank after the provider sends the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters argued that the Bureau should adopt a broader reading of the statute, and that international wire transfers should be covered by the permanent exception. These commenters argued that international wire transfers are a method by which transactions are made in a recipient country that does not allow the remittance transfer provider to know the amount of currency that will be received by a designated recipient and should thus qualify for the permanent exception. One industry commenter stated that the permanent exception is helpful for certain international ACH transactions; however, the benefit is limited by the number of recipient countries that participate in the Federal Reserve System's FedGlobal ACH program. Other industry commenters requested that all international ACH transfers be covered by the permanent exception and that the exception should not be limited to those that are sent on terms negotiated between the United States government and the recipient country's government. These commenters noted that all cross-border ACH transfers, regardless of how the exchange rate is set, are subject to similar difficulties as certain international ACH transfers that qualify for the permanent exception. Consumer group commenters supported the proposal's application of the permanent exception based on the method to certain international ACH transfers.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In each case, the Bureau agrees with the Board's interpretation. The Bureau believes that extending the permanent exception to international wire transfers and all international ACH transactions would be inconsistent with the statutory language and purpose of the provision, which specifically refers to methods of transfer <em data-original="E-03">in a recipient country</em> (emphasis added). The Bureau must give meaning to this phrase, and does not believe that the interpretation urged by commenters is dependent on a method of transfer in a particular country.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe that the permanent exception in EFTA section 919(c) applies to international wire transfers because wire transfers are not a method that is particular to a specific country or group of countries. Rather, compliance challenges may arise due to the international wire transfer business model, which is based on a chain of correspondents and two-party contractual relationships.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In addition, the application of the permanent exception to international wire transfers and ACH transactions generally would make the temporary exception superfluous. As discussed above, the statute is broad in scope, specifically covering transactions that are account-based and that are not electronic fund transfers, and therefore, covers open network transactions. Further, as described above with regard to the temporary exception, the statute specifically permits the use of estimates by depository institutions and credit unions for certain account-based transactions. If all open network transactions were included in the permanent exception, there would be no need for the temporary exception because nearly all, if not all, the types of transfers that qualify for the temporary exception would be covered by the permanent exception. The Bureau does not believe the temporary exception is superfluous. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to extend the permanent exception to these transactions.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One commenter argued that the permanent exception for method of transfer should also include instances when the remittance transfer provider and the sender agree to have the exchange rate set at some point in the future (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> floating rate products). As with wire transfers, such an agreement is not a method by which a transaction is made that is particular to a specific country or group of countries. Therefore, the Bureau also believes that this circumstance would not be eligible for the permanent exception. The Bureau notes, however, that the remittance transfer provider that is party to such an agreement may provide estimates of the exchange rate if the remittance transfer provider qualifies for the temporary exception in § 1005.32(a). For the reasons discussed above, proposed § 205.32(b)(2) is adopted as proposed in renumbered § 1005.32(b)(1)(ii). Proposed comment 32(b)(2)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed with clarifying revision, but renumbered as comment 32(b)-3 for organizational purposes.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 32(b)(2)-2 provided examples illustrating the application of the permanent exception. The comment is adopted substantially as proposed, but renumbered as comment 32(b)-4 for organizational purposes. Comment 32(b)-4.i. provides an example of when a remittance transfer would qualify for the exception. The Bureau notes that some comments received indicate that there may be confusion as to the application of the permanent exception provided in § 1005.32(b)(1)(ii) to any transfer sent via international ACH. However, comment 32(b)-4.i. explains that a transfer would only qualify for the exception when sent via international ACH on terms negotiated between the United States government and the recipient country's government, under which the exchange rate is a rate set by the recipient country's central bank or other governmental authority on the business day after the provider has sent the remittance transfer. Under such circumstances, the provider cannot determine the exact exchange rate required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv). Thus, remittance transfers sent via Directo a México currently would qualify for the permanent exception in § 1005.32(b)(1)(ii). Accordingly, proposed comment 32(b)-4.i. is adopted substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comments 32(b)(2)-2.ii. and -2.iii. provided examples of when a remittance transfer would not qualify for the permanent exception in § 1005.32(b)(1)(ii). The Bureau did not receive significant comment on the proposed comments, which are adopted substantially as proposed, with technical and clarifying edits, in renumbered comments 32(b)-4.ii. and 32(b)-4.iii. Comment 32(b)-4.ii. explains that a remittance transfer provider is not permitted to provide estimates under the permanent exception if it sends a remittance transfer via international ACH on terms negotiated between the United States government and a private-sector entity in the recipient country, under which the exchange rate is set by the institution acting as the entry point to the recipient country's payments system on the next business day. In this case, transactions are made using a method negotiated between the United States and a private entity. Nonetheless, remittance transfers sent using such a method may qualify for the temporary exception in § 1005.32(a). Comment 32(b)-4.iii. explains that a remittance transfer provider does not qualify for the permanent exception if, for example, it sends transfers via international ACH on terms negotiated between the United States government and the recipient country's government, under which the exchange rate is set by the recipient country's central bank or other governmental authority before the sender requests a transfer.

      <title>18(e) Modified Limitations on Liability and Error Resolution Requirements</title>
      <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 908 governs the timing and other requirements for consumers and financial institutions pertaining to error resolution, including provisional credit. EFTA section 909 governs consumer liability for unauthorized EFTs. The Bureau proposed to extend to all prepaid accounts the Payroll Card Rule's limited liability provisions and error resolution provisions, including provisional credit. The Bureau also proposed to reorganize existing § 1005.18(c)(3) and (4) into proposed § 1005.18(e)(1) and (2) and to revise the paragraph headings for proposed § 1005.18(e), (e)(1) and (e)(2). Similar to the reorganization of existing § 1005.18(c)(1) and (2) above into final § 1005.18(d)(1) and (2), these changes were proposed to simplify the organization of proposed § 1005.18 generally and to separate the modified requirements related to limited liability and error resolution from other modifications made for prepaid accounts.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in detail in the section-by-section analyses of § 1005.18(e)(1), (2), and (3) below, the Bureau proposed to modify Regulation E's limited liability and error resolution timing requirements for prepaid accounts to accommodate how account information would be delivered by financial institutions choosing to follow the periodic statement alternative in proposed § 1005.18(c)(1), discussed above, and to except unverified prepaid accounts from the limited liability and error resolution requirements.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>10(e)(2) Employment or Government Benefit</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 913(2), as implemented by § 1005.10(e)(2), provides that no financial institution or other person may require a consumer to establish an account for receipt of EFTs with a particular institution as a condition of employment or receipt of a government benefit. Existing comment 10(e)(2)-1 explains that an employer (including a financial institution) may not require its employees to receive their salary by direct deposit to any particular institution. These provisions regarding compulsory use precede the addition of the Payroll Card Rule to Regulation E.<footnote ref="323">In September 2013, the Bureau reiterated the applicability of Regulation E's prohibition on compulsory use for payroll card accounts. CFPB Bulletin 2013-10, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Payroll Card Accounts (Regulation E)&lt;/em&gt; (Sept. 12, 2013), &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;available at&lt;/em&gt;
              &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201309_cfpb_payroll-card-bulletin.pdf.&lt;/em&gt; The Bureau explained that, among other things, Regulation E's compulsory use provision prohibits employers from mandating that employees receive wages only on a payroll card of the employer's choosing. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt; at 3.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>No parallel comment currently exists with respect to the application of the compulsory use provision to the distribution of government benefits. In the proposal, the Bureau noted that questions had arisen as to whether the compulsory use prohibition applied to prepaid cards used to distribute non-needs tested government benefits. EFTA and Regulation E clearly apply to the electronic distribution of non-needs tested government benefits generally, and EFTA section 913(2) prohibits “requiring a consumer to establish an account for receipt of electronic fund transfers with a particular financial institution as a condition of . . . receipt of a government benefit.” To provide greater clarity, the Bureau proposed to add comment 10(e)(2)-2, which would have stated that a government agency could not require consumers to receive government benefits by direct deposit to any particular institutions. The comment would have also stated that a government agency could, alternatively, require recipients to receive their benefits via direct deposit, so long as the recipient could choose which institution would receive the deposit, or provide recipients with a choice of having their benefits deposited at a particular institution or receiving their benefits via another means.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau sought comment on whether a financial institution complies with the compulsory use prohibition if it provides the first payment to a benefit recipient on a government benefit card and, at that same time, provides information on how to divert or otherwise direct future payments to an account of the consumer's choosing. In addition, the Bureau sought comment on whether a similar restriction on compulsory use should be extended to other types of prepaid accounts (other than payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts), such as cards used by post-secondary educational institutions for financial aid disbursements or insurance companies to pay out claims.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Requests to clarify whether certain enrollment methods comply with § 1005.10(e)(2).</em> Two commenters—a program manager of government benefit cards and a State government agency—generally objected to the Bureau's proposal to clarify the application of compulsory use to government agencies. They argued that government agencies should be allowed to require that consumers receive their benefit payments on a prepaid card of the agency's choosing, since doing so allows the agencies to save money by outsourcing the disbursement process and preventing fraud related to false benefits claims. These commenters urged the Bureau to remove proposed comment 10(e)(2)-2. In the alternative, the program manager, along with a payment network and several other State government agency commenters, urged the Bureau to clarify that a covered person complies with § 1005.10(e)(2) by providing the first payment to a government benefit recipient on a prepaid card and, at that time, providing information to the recipient on how to divert or otherwise direct future payments to an account of the his or her choosing. According to these commenters, this enrollment method would allow the financial institution or other person to adopt a single, streamlined on-boarding process for beneficiaries, while still providing consumers with a real—if delayed—choice on how to receive their payments. One State government agency argued that, if the Bureau did not adopt the requested clarification allowing agencies to unilaterally disburse funds onto prepaid cards, the Bureau should delay the rule's effective date with respect to government benefit accounts to allow the agencies to identify and implement the most economical and efficient means of complying with the compulsory use prohibition.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Other commenters, including issuing banks, program managers, trade associations, a payment network, and an employer that disburses compensation via payroll card accounts, asked the Bureau to address situations—for both government benefit accounts and payroll card accounts—where the consumer is provided a choice but does not make a selection. Specifically, these commenters asked the Bureau to confirm in the final rule that a financial institution or other person complies with the compulsory use prohibition by providing a consumer with two or more alternative methods for receiving funds, and, if the consumer fails to affirmatively select from among the available methods within a prescribed period of time, disbursing the consumer's payment to a pre-selected, default enrollment method, such as a payroll card account or government benefit account. According to these commenters, this method of enrollment is standard practice among many employers and government benefit programs, and is in fact permitted under some State laws. Mandating changes to these existing practices, they argued, would require costly system changes.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several consumer group commenters, by contrast, urged the Bureau to clarify that a financial institution or other person that unilaterally enrolls a consumer in a payroll card account or government benefit account program violates the compulsory use prohibition, regardless of whether the person only disburses the consumer's initial payment onto that card or provides the consumer with information about how to divert future payments to an account of the consumer's choosing. In general, these commenters argued that an automatic, unilateral disbursement of a first payment onto a prepaid card is tantamount to a condition that the consumer have an account with a particular institution in order to receive his or her salary or government benefit, in violation of the compulsory use prohibition. Moreover, these commenters argued, default options are “sticky,” meaning that once consumers are enrolled in one payment method, they are unlikely to go through the effort to un-enroll or otherwise direct payments to another account. In other words, the commenters asserted, a consumer who continues to receive payments to a payroll card account or government benefit account after being unilaterally enrolled in that card program has not made an affirmative choice to be paid that way. A nonprofit organization representing the interests of restaurant workers provided the Bureau with survey results showing that more than a quarter of employees at a particular restaurant company who responded to the organization's survey reported that they were never told that they had options other than a payroll card account by which to receive their wages. With regards to the possibility of a financial institution's use of a default enrollment method where consumers are provided with a choice of payment method but fail to communicate a preference after a certain period of time, one consumer group indicated that it was not categorically opposed to this practice, but suggested that the period the financial institution should have to wait before enrolling a non-responsive consumer in a default enrollment method should be 30 days or more.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One consumer group commenter asked the Bureau to go further and require that, in order to comply with the compulsory use prohibitions, a financial institution or other person obtain a consumer's written consent before disbursing the consumer's payment via a payroll card account or government benefit account. Another consumer group argued that the Bureau should mandate a specific waiting period before a consumer was required to make a selection with respect to his or her preferred payment method.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Requests to expand the scope of § 1005.10(e)(2) beyond payment of salary or government benefit.</em> Although it did not propose alterations to the scope of the compulsory use prohibition, the Bureau did seek comment on whether a similar restriction should be extended to other types of prepaid accounts, as discussed above. In response, numerous consumer group commenters urged the Bureau to expand the compulsory use prohibition to other types of prepaid accounts used by third parties to disburse funds to consumers, including accounts used to disburse student aid or student loans, accounts used to disburse insurance or workers' compensation payments, and accounts used by correctional facilities to disburse funds to incarcerated or formerly incarcerated individuals. The commenters expressed concern that consumers in these circumstances could not otherwise avoid the high fees or restrictive terms and conditions that they allege often accompany such cards, if the consumers must accept the cards to access their funds.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several commenters, including several members of Congress, pointed to prison release cards as a particularly troubling example of a prepaid account product that they say comes with high fees and terms and conditions that limit consumers' ability to access their own funds. Funds disbursed onto prison release cards may include prison job wages or public benefits paid to the prisoner while in prison. The commenters argued that consumers who receive these prepaid products should have a choice with respect to how they get paid. In the alternative, the commenters urged the Bureau to limit fees on cards that the consumer has to accept, as well as on cards issued on an unsolicited basis. In response, a commenter that manages several prison release card programs, as well as other “correction-related” services submitted a comment disputing the consumer groups' allegations with respect to its programs. This commenter objected to the suggestion that its prepaid products are or should be subject to the compulsory use provision. Among other arguments, the commenter noted that prison release cards are a superior alternative to checks, which are often accompanied by excessive check cashing fees, or cash, which can be mismanaged by correctional staff. This commenter also took issue with the suggestion that its prepaid account programs are accompanied by particularly high fees, noting that State departments of corrections that bid for its services look carefully at the fees charged to card users. The commenter provided fee schedules for several of its programs that it argued show that the programs' cardholder fees are not exorbitant.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting comment 10(e)(2)-2 as proposed with minor modifications for clarity and conformity. The Bureau declines to amend regulatory text or adopt additional commentary as requested by some commenters. The Bureau continues to believe it is important that consumers have a choice with respect to how they receive their salary or government benefits. Whether a financial institution or other person complies with § 1005.10(e)(2), therefore, depends on whether the financial institution or other person provides the consumer with a choice regarding how to receive his or her payment. For example, a financial institution or other person that mandates that consumers receive their salary or government benefit on a specific prepaid card violates EFTA section 913(2) and § 1005.10(e)(2), as the statutory and regulatory text make clear. Accordingly, the Bureau declines to revise § 1005.10(e)(2) to allow government agencies to require consumers to receive government benefits on a prepaid card of the agency's choosing, as some commenters requested.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Likewise, after considering the comments on this issue, the Bureau agrees with consumer group commenters that a financial institution or other person that mandates that a consumer receive the <em data-original="E-03">first</em> payment of salary or government benefits on a prepaid card does not give the consumer a choice regarding how to receive the payment, even if the consumer can later re-direct the payment to an account of his or her choice.<footnote ref="324">The Bureau likewise declines to grandfather in or provide an extended timeframe to amend or rebid existing vendor contracts for government benefit accounts beyond the final rule's general effective date, as requested by some commenters. See the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(h) below for a more detailed discussion of the final rule's effective date.</footnote>
             In such a scenario, the consumer does not have a choice with respect to how to receive the first payment of salary or government benefit; rather, at least with respect to that first payment, the consumer was required to establish an account with the financial institution that issued the prepaid account as a condition of receiving the funds.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not at this time and on this record believe it would be appropriate to set a bright-line test based solely on amount of time or whether the consumer agrees to the preferred payment method in writing, as some commenters suggested. As the Bureau noted in the proposal, there are many ways a consumer can obtain a prepaid account, and the Bureau believes its disclosure regime should be—and is—adaptable to this variety.<footnote ref="325">79 FR 77102, 77148 (Dec. 23, 2014).</footnote>
             The Bureau notes that how long a consumer had to select a preferred payment method may not always be indicative of whether the consumer was given a choice regarding how to receive his payment. For example, a company's policies and procedures may dictate that employees be given at least two weeks to select a preferred payment method. However, such a policy may not help an employee who is ordered by his direct supervisor to accept wages via a payroll card. Likewise, the way a consumer expresses her preferred payment method may not be indicative of whether she exercised a choice with respect to how to receive her payments. Relatedly, as some industry commenters noted, consumers are sometimes given a choice between two or more payment alternatives, but may fail to indicate their preference. Depending on the facts and circumstances—for example, the date by which the consumer has to be paid her wages under State law—it may be reasonable for a financial institution or other person in this scenario to employ a reasonable default enrollment method.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also declines to amend existing regulatory text or adopt additional commentary concerning which alternative payment methods must be made available to a consumer to comply with the compulsory use prohibition. In response to requests for clarification from a member of Congress and an industry commenter on the one hand, and several consumer group commenters on the other, the Bureau notes that the compulsory use prohibition does not amount to a requirement that a financial institution or other person provide a consumer with any particular alternative to a prepaid account. More specifically, § 1005.10(e)(2) does not mandate that a covered person offer a consumer the option of getting paid by paper check (to address concerns from the member of Congress and industry commenter), nor require that one of the payment options made available to the consumer be direct deposit to an account of the consumer's choosing (as the consumer groups requested). Rather, the consumer must not be required to establish a particular account and must be presented with at least one alternative to the prepaid account, which may be a paper check, direct deposit to the consumer's bank account or to her own prepaid account, or some other payment method.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to the comments recommending that the Bureau expand application of the compulsory use prohibition to other types of prepaid accounts, the Bureau has concluded that it would not be appropriate to take such a step at this time. The compulsory use prohibition has been in place and largely unchanged since its adoption in 1978 in EFTA.<footnote ref="326">EFTA section 913; Public Law 95-630, 92 Stat. 3737 (1978) (codified at 15 U.S.C. 1693k).</footnote>
             The Bureau believes it would be inappropriate to alter the application of the prohibition in the manner suggested by commenters in this final rule without additional public participation and information gathering about the specific product types at issue. The Bureau notes that to the extent that student, insurance, or prison release cards are used to disburse consumers' salaries or government benefits, as defined under applicable law, such accounts are already covered by § 1005.10(e)(2) and will continue to be so under this final rule. The Bureau notes further that it is continuing to monitor financial institutions' and other persons' practices relating to consumers' lack of choice (including with respect to prepaid accounts that are not subject to the compulsory use prohibitions). Depending on the facts and circumstances, the Bureau may consider whether exercise of the Bureau's authority under title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, including its authority over unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices, would be appropriate.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Appendix A-5 Model Clauses for Government Agencies (§ 1005.15(e)(1) and (2))</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Existing appendix A-5 provides model language for government agencies that offer accounts for distributing government benefits to consumers electronically; this model language reflects the modifications made to certain Regulation E provisions by existing § 1005.15. The Bureau proposed to relabel appendix A-5 as <em data-original="E-03">Model Clauses for Government Benefit Accounts (§ 1005.15(e)(1) and (2))</em> and to revise the heading of paragraph (a) for clarity. The Bureau also proposed to revise the text of paragraph (a) of appendix A-5, which currently explains to consumers how to obtain information about account balances and account histories, to note that the consumer's balance information, along with an 18 month history of the consumer's account transactions, was available online. The Bureau also proposed to revise the paragraph regarding a written transaction summary to correspond with the proposed revised language for prepaid accounts in paragraph (a) of appendix A-7, to state that the consumer had a right to at least 18 months of written history of account transactions by calling or writing to the agency (or its designee). The paragraph would have also stated that the consumer would not be charged a fee for such information unless the consumer requested it more than once per month. The paragraph would have retained the existing optional bracketed language stating that the consumer could also request such a history by contacting his or her caseworker.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau similarly proposed to revise paragraph (b) of appendix A-5, which sets forth model clauses regarding disclosure of error resolution procedures for government agencies that provide alternative means of obtaining account information. The Bureau proposed to revise the section citation in the paragraph heading, and to revise the first paragraph of paragraph (b) to correspond with the proposed revised language for prepaid accounts in paragraph (b) of appendix A-7. Specifically, the Bureau proposed to remove the sentence stating that the agency must hear from the consumer no later than 60 days after the consumer learns of the error, and to add language stating that the agency must allow the consumer to report an error until 60 days after the earlier of the date the consumer electronically accessed his or her account, if the error could be viewed in the electronic history, or the date the agency sent the first written history on which the error appeared. The paragraph would have also stated that the consumer could request a written transaction history at any time by calling or writing, or optionally by contacting the consumer's caseworker.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive any comments specifically regarding the proposed changes to appendix A-5. As discussed in the section-by-section analyses of §§ 1005.15(d) and 1005.18(c) below, however, the Bureau is revising the proposed time periods that apply to a consumer's right to obtain account information. Under the final rule, consumers will have the right to access up to 12 months of account history online, instead of the 18 months of account history in the proposed rule. In addition, consumers will have the right to request at least 24 months of written transaction history, instead of the 18 months set forth in the proposed rule. The Bureau is revising appendix A-5 to reflect these changed time periods and to make certain other conforming changes, but is otherwise finalizing appendix A-5 as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>In the discussion below of the Bureau's final changes to Regulation Z, the Bureau explains in detail its approach to the regulation of credit offered in connection with prepaid accounts. (That discussion provides an overall explanation of the Bureau's approach in this rulemaking to credit offered in connection with prepaid accounts, including with respect to changes to Regulation E, the details of which are set forth below.)</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z § 1026.61 below, the Bureau is adopting a new definition of “hybrid prepaid-credit card” in new Regulation Z § 1026.61 which sets forth the circumstances in which a prepaid card is a credit card under Regulation Z.<footnote ref="313">Throughout the section-by-section analyses of Regulations E and Z, the term “hybrid prepaid-credit card” refers to a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61.</footnote>
             A prepaid card that is a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61 is a credit card under final Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(15)(i). <em data-original="E-03">See also</em> new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(1) and new Regulation Z comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.F. As set forth in new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(1), a prepaid card that is not a “hybrid prepaid-credit card” is not a credit card for purposes of Regulation Z. <em data-original="E-03">See also</em> new Regulation Z comment 2(a)(15)-2.ii.D.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the <em data-original="E-03">Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z</em> section and in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z § 1026.61 below, the Bureau generally intends to cover under Regulation Z overdraft credit features offered in connection with prepaid accounts where the credit features are offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliates, or business partners. New Regulation Z § 1026.61(b) generally requires that such credit features be structured as separate sub-accounts or accounts, distinct from the prepaid asset account, to facilitate transparency and compliance with various Regulation Z requirements. New Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(2)(i) provides that a prepaid card is a “hybrid prepaid-credit card” with respect to a separate credit feature if the card meets the following two conditions: (1) The card can be used from time to time to access credit from the separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; and (2) the separate credit feature is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. New Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(2)(i) defines such a separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit credit as a “covered separate credit feature.” Thus, the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses both the covered separate credit feature and the asset feature of the prepaid account, and the hybrid prepaid-credit card is a credit card under Regulation Z with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z § 1026.61 below, the Bureau also has decided to exclude prepaid cards from being covered as credit cards under Regulation Z when they access certain specified types of credit. First, under new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii), a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a separate credit feature that does not meet both of the conditions above, for example, where the credit feature is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate or its business partner. Such credit features are defined as “non-covered separate credit features,” as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(2) below. Under new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(4), a prepaid card also is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card when the prepaid card accesses incidental credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account where the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit.<footnote ref="314">Throughout the section-by-section analyses of Regulations E and Z, the term “incidental credit” is used to refer to credit that meets the conditions of new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(4).</footnote>
             A prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new Regulation Z § 1026.61 or a credit card under final Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) when it accesses credit from these types of credit features. For more detailed explanations of when prepaid cards are not credit cards under Regulation Z, see the section-by-section analyses of Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(2) and (4) below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As part of the Bureau's approach to the regulation of credit offered in connection with prepaid accounts, the Bureau's final rule revises the compulsory use provision of Regulation E, existing § 1005.10(e)(1), to make clear that it applies to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards as defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61. The Bureau also is providing guidance to explain that incidental credit described in new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(4) is exempt from the compulsory use provisions in Regulation E, similar to checking overdraft services.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>EFTA's compulsory use provision, EFTA section 913(1),<footnote ref="315">15 U.S.C. 1693k(1).</footnote>
             prohibits any person from conditioning the extension of credit to a consumer on the consumer's repayment by means of preauthorized EFTs. As implemented in Regulation E, existing § 1005.10(e)(1) currently states that “[n]o financial institution or other person may condition an extension of credit to a consumer on the consumer's repayment by preauthorized EFTs, except for credit extended under an overdraft credit plan or extended to maintain a specified minimum balance in the consumer's account.” The term “credit” is defined in existing § 1005.2(f) to mean the right granted by a financial institution to a consumer to defer payment of debt, incur debt and defer its payment, or purchase property or services and defer payment therefor. The term preauthorized EFT is defined in existing § 1005.2(k) to mean an EFT authorized in advance to recur at substantially regular intervals.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Congress enacted the compulsory use provision to prevent financial institutions that are creditors from mandating repayment of credit by future preauthorized EFTs. Were the compulsory use provision not to exist, creditors could access consumers' available funds at the same institution via direct transfers, or at other institutions via recurring ACH transfers, to repay the debt. By doing so, consumers could lose access to these funds and lose the ability to prioritize repayment of debts, as a creditor could compel the consumer to grant the creditor preauthorized transfer access to the consumer's asset account as a condition for agreeing to provide credit to that consumer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In adopting what is now existing § 1005.10(e)(1) in 1981 to implement EFTA section 913(1), the Board used its EFTA exception authority to exclude overdraft credit plans from the general compulsory use rule of EFTA section 913(1).<footnote ref="316">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 46 FR 2972, 2973 (Jan. 13, 1981) (“After careful consideration of the issues raised, the Board is adopting the amendment as proposed.

        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed certain modifications to the compulsory use provision. In particular, the proposal would have provided that the provision's exception for overdraft credit plans would not have extended to overdraft credit plans accessed by prepaid cards that are credit cards under Regulation Z. Specifically, the proposal would have amended existing § 1005.10(e)(1) to provide that the exception for overdraft plans from the compulsory use provision does not apply to a credit plan that is a credit card account accessed by an access device for a prepaid account where the access device is a credit card under Regulation Z. Thus, under the proposal, the compulsory use provision in proposed § 1005.10(e)(1) would have applied to overdraft credit plans accessed by prepaid cards that are credit cards under Regulation Z.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Under the proposal, existing comment 10(e)(1)-2 related to the exception for overdraft credit plans would have been amended to explain that this exception does not apply to credit extended under a credit plan that is a credit card account accessed by an access device for a prepaid account where the access device is a credit card under Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(15)(i).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The proposal would have added comment 10(e)(1)-3 to provide guidance on how the prohibition in proposed § 1005.10(e)(1) would have applied to credit extended under a credit plan that is a credit card account accessed by a prepaid card under Regulation Z as discussed above. Specifically, proposed comment 10(e)(1)-3 would have explained that under proposed § 1005.10(e)(1), creditors must not require by electronic means on a preauthorized, recurring basis repayment of credit extended under a credit plan that is a credit card account accessed by an access device for a prepaid account where the access device is a credit card under Regulation Z.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 10(e)(1)-3 also would have provided that the prohibition in proposed § 1005.10(e)(1) would have applied to any credit extended under a credit card plan as described above, including credit arising from transactions not using the credit card itself but taking place under plans that involve credit cards. For example, if the consumer writes a check that accesses a credit card plan as discussed above, the resulting credit would be subject to the prohibition in proposed § 1005.10(e)(1) since it is incurred through a credit card plan, even though the consumer did not use an associated credit card.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Under Regulation Z proposed comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.F, a prepaid card would not have been a credit card under Regulation Z where the prepaid card only accesses credit that is not subject to any finance charge, as defined in Regulation Z § 1026.4, or any fee described in Regulation Z § 1026.4(c), and is not payable by written agreement in more than four installments. Proposed comment 10(e)(1)-3 would have cross-referenced Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(15)(i), proposed comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.F to explain that a prepaid card is not a credit card under Regulation Z if the access device only accesses credit that is not subject to any finance charge, as defined in Regulation Z § 1026.4, or any fee described in Regulation Z § 1026.4(c), and is not payable by written agreement in more than four installments. Thus, under the proposal, the prohibition in proposed § 1005.10(e)(1) would not have applied to credit extended in connection with a prepaid account under an overdraft credit plan that is not a credit card account. Under the proposal, an overdraft credit plan would not have been a credit card account if it would have been accessed only by a prepaid card that only accesses credit that is not subject to any finance charge as defined in Regulation Z § 1026.4, or any fee described in Regulation Z § 1026.4(c), and is not payable by written agreement in more than four installments.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 10(e)(1)-3.i also would have explained the connection between the prohibition in proposed § 1005.10(e)(1) on the compulsory use of preauthorized EFT to repay credit extended under a credit plan accessed by prepaid cards that are credit cards under existing Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) and proposed comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.F, and the prohibition on offsets by credit card issuers in proposed Regulation Z § 1026.12(d). Under existing Regulation Z § 1026.12(d)(1), a card issuer may not take any action, either before or after termination of credit card privileges, to offset a cardholder's indebtedness arising from a consumer credit transaction under the relevant credit card plan against funds of the cardholder held on deposit with the card issuer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Under proposed Regulation Z § 1026.12(d)(3), with respect to credit card accounts that are accessed by prepaid cards, a card issuer generally would not have been prohibited from periodically deducting all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt from a deposit account (such as a prepaid account) held with the card issuer under a plan that is authorized in writing by the cardholder, so long as the creditor does not make such deductions to the plan more frequently than once per calendar month. Therefore, a card issuer for such credit card accounts would have been prohibited under proposed Regulation Z § 1026.12(d)(3) from automatically deducting all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt from a deposit account (such as a prepaid account) held with the card issuer on a daily or weekly basis, or whenever deposits are made to the deposit account. Under proposed Regulation Z § 1026.12(d)(3), with respect to credit card accounts that are accessed by prepaid cards, EFTs pursuant to a plan described in Regulation Z § 1026.12(d)(3) would have been preauthorized EFTs under existing § 1005.2(k) because such EFTs would be authorized in advance to recur periodically (but could not recur more frequently than once per calendar month). Proposed comment 10(e)(1)-3.i thus would have explained that proposed § 1005.10(e)(1) further restricts the card issuer from requiring payment from a deposit account (including a prepaid account) of credit card balances by electronic means on a preauthorized, recurring basis where the credit card account is accessed by an access device for a prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As a technical revision, the proposal also would have moved existing guidance in existing comment 10(e)(1)-1 related to when financial institutions may provide incentives to consumers to agree to automatic repayment plans to a new proposed comment 10(e)(1)-4; no substantive changes were intended.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>A trade association and an issuing bank urged the Bureau not to adopt the proposed changes to the compulsory use exception in Regulation E for overdraft credit plans that are accessed by prepaid cards that are credit cards under Regulation Z. These commenters asserted that allowing financial institutions to recoup overdraft balances from incoming credits to the account is the only way for those institutions to mitigate the credit risk caused by overdrafts. These commenters suggested that the Bureau's proposed compulsory use and offset prohibitions, for example, would effectively deny consumers the ability to access short-term credit in connection with prepaid accounts. These concerns about the rule's impact on small-dollar credit are discussed in more detail below in the <em data-original="E-03">Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation</em> Z section.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Nonetheless, other industry trade associations representing credit unions agreed with the Bureau's proposal not to extend the overdraft credit plan exception in the compulsory use provision in existing § 1005.10(e)(1) to overdraft credit plans accessed by prepaid cards that are credit cards under Regulation Z.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One consumer group likewise supported the Bureau's proposal not to exempt from the compulsory use provision in existing § 1005.10(e)(1) overdraft credit plans that are accessed by prepaid cards that are credit cards under Regulation Z. This commenter stated that giving consumers control over how and when to repay overdraft credit would protect consumers that hold prepaid cards that are credit cards under Regulation Z and give creditors incentives to consider whether those consumers have the ability to pay credit that will be extended under such overdraft credit plans. This commenter also noted that the exemption from the compulsory use provision for overdraft credit plans is not statutory.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards.</em> For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is finalizing § 1005.10(e)(1) as proposed with certain revisions to be consistent with provisions in new Regulation Z § 1026.61 for when a prepaid card is a credit card under Regulation Z.<footnote ref="317">The Regulation Z proposal would have provided that the term “credit card” includes an account number that is not a prepaid card that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan that allows deposits directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. Proposed § 1005.10(e)(1) would have provided that the compulsory use provision's general prohibition against conditioning the extension of credit to a consumer on the consumer's repayment by means of preauthorized EFTs would have applied to credit card accounts under Regulation Z accessed by such account numbers. Proposed comments 10(e)(1)-2 and -3 would have provided additional guidance on how proposed § 1005.10(e)(1) would have applied to these credit card plans accessed by these account numbers. For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) below, the final rule does not adopt the provisions related to the account numbers that would have made these account numbers into credit cards under Regulation Z. Thus, the provisions in proposed § 1005.10(e)(1) and proposed comments 10(e)(1)-2 and -3 in connection with these account numbers have not been adopted.</footnote>
             Specifically, the Bureau has modified existing § 1005.10(e)(1) to provide that the overdraft credit plan exception in existing § 1005.10(e)(1) does not apply to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61. As discussed above, under the final rule, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(4)).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consistent with the intent of the proposal, the Bureau has revised existing comment 10(e)(1)-2 which relates to the exception for overdraft credit plans. The final rule has moved existing comment 10(e)(1)-2 to new comment 10(e)(1)-2.i and revised it to provide that the exception for overdraft credit plans in final § 1005.10(e)(1) applies to overdraft credit plans other than for a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61. Proposed comment 10(e)(1)-3 would have referenced guidance on when a prepaid card would not have been a credit card under Regulation Z as proposed, such that the overdraft exception in proposed § 1005.10(e)(1) would have still applied to credit accessed by those prepaid cards. The final rule moves this guidance to final comment 10(e)(1)-2.ii and revises it as discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau is finalizing the other guidance in proposed comment 10(e)(1)-3, renumbered as new comment 10(e)(1)-3.i, with revisions to be consistent with new Regulation Z § 1026.61. Specifically, final comment 10(e)(1)-3.i explains that under final § 1005.10(e)(1), creditors may not require by electronic means on a preauthorized, recurring basis repayment of credit extended under a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61. Consistent with the proposal, final comment 10(e)(1)-3.i also clarifies that the prohibition in final § 1005.10(e)(1) applies to any credit extended under such a credit feature, including preauthorized checks. Final comment 10(e)(1)-3.i also cross-references new Regulation Z § 1026.61 and new comment 61(a)(1)-3, which provide guidance related to the credit extended under a covered separate credit feature by use of a preauthorized check on the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Also, the Bureau has moved the guidance in proposed comment 10(e)(1)-3.i to new comment 10(e)(1)-3.ii and has revised it to be consistent with new Regulation Z § 1026.61. New comment 10(e)(1)-3.ii explains the connection between the prohibition in final § 1005.10(e)(1) on the compulsory use of preauthorized EFTs to repay credit extended under a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, as defined in Regulation Z § 1026.61, and the prohibition on offsets by credit card issuers in final Regulation Z § 1026.12(d). Specifically, new comment 10(e)(1)-3.ii provides that under existing Regulation Z § 1026.12(d)(1), a card issuer may not take any action, either before or after termination of credit card privileges, to offset a cardholder's indebtedness arising from a consumer credit transaction under the relevant credit card plan against funds of the cardholder held on deposit with the card issuer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Under final Regulation Z § 1026.12(d)(3), with respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards as defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61, a card issuer generally is not prohibited from periodically deducting all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt from a deposit account (such as a prepaid account) held with the card issuer under a plan that is authorized in writing by the cardholder, so long as the card issuer does not make such deductions to the plan more frequently than once per calendar month. A card issuer therefore is prohibited under final Regulation Z § 1026.12(d)(3) from automatically deducting all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt from a covered separate credit feature from a deposit account (such as a prepaid account) held with the card issuer on a daily or weekly basis, or whenever deposits are made to the deposit account. In Regulation E, final § 1005.10(e)(1) provides a complementary prohibition on the card issuer from requiring payment from a deposit account (such as a prepaid account) of credit card balances of a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card by electronic means on a preauthorized, recurring basis.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consistent with the proposal, as a technical revision, the Bureau has moved existing guidance in comment 10(e)(1)-1 related to when financial institutions may provide incentives to consumers to agree to automatic repayment plans to a new comment 10(e)(1)-4; no substantive change is intended.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consistent with the statutory text and purposes of EFTA, the Bureau is not extending the exception for overdraft credit plans currently in § 1005.10(e)(1) to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards as defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61. The purposes of EFTA are to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of consumers participating in EFT systems and to provide individual consumer rights.<footnote ref="318">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; EFTA section 902(b); 15 U.S.C. 1693(b).</footnote>
             Further, EFTA's legislative history states that the EFTA compulsory use provision is designed to assure that “EFT develops in an atmosphere of free choice for the consumer.” <footnote ref="319">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Senate Report No. 95-915 at 16 (1978).</footnote>
             The Bureau believes its final rule, which does not extend Regulation E's existing exception for overdraft credit plans to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, should ensure that consumers have choice when deciding whether and how to link their prepaid accounts to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards and have control over the funds in their prepaid accounts if and when such a link is established.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in greater detail in the section-by-section analyses of Regulation Z §§ 1026.5(b)(2)(ii), 1026.7(b)(11), and 1026.12(d) below, the Bureau also believes that not extending the exception for overdraft credit plans to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards is consistent with the purposes of and provisions in TILA. In particular, TILA section 169 prohibits offsets by credit card issuers.<footnote ref="320">15 U.S.C. 1666h(a); &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;see also&lt;/em&gt; Regulation Z § 1026.12(d).</footnote>
             In addition, TILA sections 127(b)(12) and (o) require that for credit card accounts under an open-end consumer credit plan, payment due dates—which must be the same date each month—must be disclosed on the Regulation Z periodic statement.<footnote ref="321">15 U.S.C. 1637(b)(12) and (o); &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;see also&lt;/em&gt; Regulation Z § 1026.7(b)(11)(i)(A).</footnote>
             In addition, TILA section 163 provides that, for credit card accounts under an open-end consumer credit plan, a card issuer must adopt reasonable procedures designed to ensure that: (1) Periodic statements for those accounts are mailed or delivered at least 21 days prior to the payment due date disclosed on the Regulation Z statement as discussed above; and (2) the card issuer does not treat as late for any purpose a required minimum periodic payment received by the card issuer within 21 days after mailing or delivery of the Regulation Z periodic statement disclosing the due date for that payment.<footnote ref="322">15 U.S.C. 1666b; &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;see also&lt;/em&gt; Regulation Z § 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A).</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In particular, the Bureau believes that the revisions to existing § 1005.10(e)(1) complement the offset prohibition and the periodic statement requirements in Regulation Z by helping to ensure that consumers do not lose access to prepaid account funds and lose the ability to prioritize repayment of debts, one of the main purposes of EFTA section 913(1), as implemented by final § 1005.10(e)(1). The Bureau is concerned that absent these protections, with respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, some card issuers might attempt to avoid the TILA offset prohibition by requiring that all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt under the covered separate credit feature be automatically deducted from the prepaid account to help ensure that the debt is repaid (similar to how overdraft services function today). For example, the Bureau believes that without its revisions to the compulsory use provision, financial institutions might require that prepaid account consumers set up automated payment plans to repay the credit card debt under the covered separate credit feature and set the payment due date each month to align with the expected date of incoming deposits to the prepaid account. The Bureau believes that this type of payment arrangement would undermine the purposes of EFTA section 913(1), as implemented by final § 1005.10(e)(1), which is designed to help ensure that consumers do not lose access to account funds and lose the ability to prioritize repayment of debts. Thus, the Bureau does not believe that it is appropriate to extend the exception for overdraft credit plans to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>To the extent that the Board justified its original treatment of overdraft credit plans as providing benefits to consumers from automatic payment, the Bureau notes that under this final rule consumers would still be allowed to <em data-original="E-03">choose</em> to make payments on the covered separate credit features on an automatic basis once per month if they find it beneficial to do so. The Bureau also believes that certain credit card rules in Regulation Z that apply under the final rule to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards that are credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan will help consumers avoid late payments and excessive late fees with respect to their covered separate credit features. For example, as discussed above, under the final rule, card issuers would be required, under final Regulation Z § 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>), to adopt reasonable procedures to ensure that Regulation Z periodic statements for covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards that are credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan are mailed or delivered at least 21 days prior to the payment due date disclosed on the periodic statement. The Bureau believes this will help ensure that consumers have sufficient time after receiving a periodic statement for such a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card to make a payment on that credit feature. Also, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analyses of Regulation Z §§ 1026.52(b) and 1026.55 below, with respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards that are credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, card issuers are limited in the circumstances in which they could increase interest rates for late payments and are limited in the amount of late fees they could charge to consumers who pay late, as set forth in final Regulation Z §§ 1026.52(b) and 1026.55.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Credit features not accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards.</em> As discussed above, the final rule moves existing comment 10(e)(1)-2 to new comment 10(e)(1)-2.i and revises it to provide that the exception for overdraft credit plans in final § 1005.10(e)(1) applies to overdraft credit plans other than for a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in Regulation Z § 1026.61. Proposed comment 10(e)(1)-3 would have referenced guidance on when a prepaid card would not have been a credit card under Regulation Z as proposed, such that the overdraft exception in proposed § 1005.10(e)(1) would have still applied to credit accessed by those prepaid cards. As explained in more detail below, the final rule moves this guidance to final comment 10(e)(1)-2.ii and revises it.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z § 1026.61 below, the Bureau has decided to exclude prepaid cards from being covered as credit cards under Regulation Z when they access certain specified types of credit. First, under new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii), a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a “non-covered separate credit feature,” which means that the separate credit feature either (1) cannot be accessed in the course of a prepaid card transaction to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers, or (2) is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. Second, under new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(4), a prepaid card also is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card when the prepaid card accesses incidental credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account where the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit. A prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new Regulation Z § 1026.61 or a credit card under final Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) when it accesses credit from these types of credit features. For more detailed explanations of when prepaid cards are not credit cards under Regulation Z, see the section-by-section analyses of Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(2) and (4) below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 10(e)(1)-2.i provides that the exception for overdraft credit plans in final § 1005.10(e)(1) applies to overdraft credit plans other than for a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in Regulation Z § 1026.61. The final rule also adds new comment 10(e)(1)-2.ii to provide additional guidance on the application of the exception in § 1005.10(e)(1) with respect to the circumstances described above in which a prepaid card is not a credit card when the prepaid card accesses incidental credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account where the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit. Specifically, new comment 10(e)(1)-2.ii provides that credit extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of a prepaid account that meets the conditions of Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(4) is considered credit extended pursuant to an overdraft credit plan for purposes of § 1005.10(e)(1). Thus, the exception for overdraft credit plans in § 1005.10(e)(1) applies to this credit.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A credit feature that does not qualify as a covered separate credit feature under new Regulation Z § 1026.61 because it cannot be accessed in the course of a prepaid card transaction to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers would be subject to the compulsory use rule under final § 1005.10(e)(1); the exception to final § 1005.10(e)(1) does not apply because such a credit product is not an overdraft line of credit or overdraft service. The Bureau also does not believe that the exception to § 1005.10(e)(1) would be invoked with regard to a credit feature that does not qualify as a covered separate credit feature under new Regulation Z § 1026.61 because it is offered by an unrelated third party, since that unrelated third party will typically not be aware that the consumer had chosen to link the credit feature to his or her prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(ii) would have provided that, except for disclosures provided to a consumer through the telephone number described in proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">11</em>) or disclosures provided orally pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(1)(iii), disclosures required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) and (ii) must be made in a retainable form. Proposed comment 18(b)(3)(ii)-1 would have explained that a financial institution may satisfy the requirement to provide electronic disclosures in a retainable form if it provides disclosures on its Web site in a format that would be capable of being printed, saved or emailed to a consumer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As noted in the proposal, § 1005.13(b) contains recordkeeping requirements applicable to Regulation E generally. However, the Bureau did not believe it was necessary that the oral disclosures provided to a consumer for a prepaid account acquired orally by telephone or the long form disclosure accessed by a consumer via telephone pre-acquisition in a retail store be retainable. Pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(f), after having acquired a prepaid account orally (or by any other means), a consumer would have received the long form disclosure in the initial disclosures provided for the prepaid account. Further, the long form disclosure would also generally be available on the financial institution's Web site, as part of the full prepaid account agreement that would be required to be posted pursuant to proposed § 1005.19. The Bureau also did not believe it would be practicable to provide retainable forms of oral disclosures. The Bureau did, however, believe that providing retainable forms of written and electronic disclosures would be feasible.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, and in the absence of comments raising concerns about the proposed retainability requirement, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(ii), renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(6)(ii), with certain modifications. The Bureau has added additional specificity to this provision to clarify exceptions to the retainability requirements for certain disclosures permitted or required under the final rule. The Bureau has also added to the final rule a cross-reference to § 1005.4(a)(1), which generally requires that disclosures provided pursuant to Regulation E be in a form consumers may keep, and conforms the language in the final rule to parallel that of § 1005.4(a)(1). In addition, as set forth below, the Bureau is adopting revisions to comment 18(b)(3)(ii)-1, renumbered as comment 18(b)(6)(ii)-1. Finally, the Bureau has made technical modifications to the rule for conformity and clarity.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.18(b)(6)(ii) provides that, pursuant to § 1005.4(a)(1), disclosures required by § 1005.18(b) must be made in a form that a consumer may keep, except for disclosures provided orally pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii) or (iii), long form disclosures provided via SMS as permitted by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiii) for a prepaid account sold at retail locations pursuant to the retail location exception in final § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii), and the disclosure of a purchase price pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(5) that is not disclosed on the exterior of the packaging material for a prepaid account sold at a retail location pursuant to the retail location exception in final § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau continues to believe that its modification to the general retainability requirement in Regulation E for oral disclosures (and certain other disclosures) is appropriate, as the Bureau does not believe it would be practicable to provide retainable forms of oral disclosures. The Bureau also notes that the requirements of final § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii)(D) and (f)(1) will ensure that even consumers who acquire prepaid accounts orally by telephone or who access the long form disclosure for prepaid accounts sold at retail locations either orally or via SMS will receive the long form disclosure in a retainable format, albeit after they acquire the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Final comment 18(b)(6)(ii)-1 illustrates the retainability requirement with an example stating that a short form disclosure with a tear strip running through it would not be deemed retainable because use of the tear strip to gain access to the prepaid account access device inside the packaging would destroy part of the short form disclosure. Electronic disclosures are deemed retainable if the consumer is able to print, save, and email the disclosures from the Web site or mobile application on which they are displayed. Therefore, a pop-up window or modal <footnote ref="458">Modal windows, also known as dialog boxes or lightboxes, are “pop-up” elements that appear in front of a Web page, blocking the main page below. Similar to pop-up windows or system alerts, modals are unique because they prevent interaction with the page underneath.</footnote>
             from which a consumer can only print, save, or email the disclosure by taking a screen shot of it would not satisfy the rule's retainability requirement.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau declines to require that electronic disclosures provided via a pop-up window be <em data-original="E-03">easily</em> printed, as requested by a consumer group commenter because the Bureau believes such a standard is subjective and may be imprecise. The Bureau also cautions against the use of pop-up windows or modals from which it is difficult for consumers to figure out how to print or to actually print. Providing electronic disclosures in a manner which a consumer is not able to retain them by printing, saving, or emailing would not comply with this final rule and would be contrary to the general retainability requirement for disclosures provided under Regulation E.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Determination of Which Additional Fee Types To Disclose Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A) requires disclosure of the two fee types that generate the highest revenue from consumers for the prepaid account program or across prepaid account programs that share the same fee schedule during the time period provided in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D) and (E), excluding (<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) fees required to be disclosed pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (vii) and (5); (<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) any fee types that generated less than 5 percent of the total revenue from consumers for the prepaid account program or across prepaid account programs that share the same fee schedule during the relevant time period; and (<em data-original="E-03">3</em>) any finance charges as described in final Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11) imposed in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in final § 1026.61.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Specific aspects of this provision, and related commentary, are discussed in turn below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Two additional fee types.</em> Final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) requires the disclosure of fee types, rather than individual fees. Requiring financial institutions to disclose additional fee types for both final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii) and (ix) should further reduce burden on industry relative to the proposal.<footnote ref="412">As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A), the Bureau believes this approach addresses a number of the concerns raised by commenters regarding the proposed disclosure of the total number of additional fees.</footnote>
             First, final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii) and (ix) are coordinated such that both provisions require disclosure of additional fee types; therefore industry will use the same criteria to formulate the disclosures for both provisions thus avoiding the cost of maintaining separate rubrics.<footnote ref="413">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; final comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-4.</footnote>
             Second, organizing the disclosures around fee types rather than discrete fees simplifies the organizational process by reducing the number of distinct fee categories financial institutions must track and analyze in determining the disclosure of additional fee types. Third, in response to industry commenters' concerns about how to categorize fee types, final comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-2 lists examples of fee types and the breakdowns of discrete fee variations within fee types that a financial institution may use when determining the disclosures required by both final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii) and (ix). The Bureau balanced multiple considerations in compiling this list of examples, including existing industry practices with regard to fee types, the accounting burdens associated with relatively narrower or broader definitions of fee types, and the potential benefits to both industry and consumers in using narrower definitions of fee types to communicate information about specific account features and fees. The Bureau believes the resulting list strikes an appropriate balance by capturing categories and terms employed by the prepaid industry itself that will be most useful to financial institutions and consumers in determining and understanding additional fee types. The Bureau is providing flexibility to financial institutions to fashion appropriate names for other fee types, including fee types for services that do not yet exist in the prepaid marketplace.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe the use of fee types will compromise the benefit to consumers of the disclosure required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix), as suggested by some commenters. While it is true that the additional fee types disclosed will constitute broader categories than disclosure of individual fee types, such as the disclosure of fees for bill payment generally versus a specific fee for regular or expedited delivery of a bill payment, there are benefits and detriments to either approach for both consumers and financial institutions and as discussed above, the Bureau believes the approach in the final rule strikes an appropriate balance. To allow financial institutions flexibility to disclose discrete fee variations, pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(C), financial institutions with additional fee types with two or fewer fee variations may disclose those fee variations by name and fee amount. Similarly, final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(B) permits financial institutions to disclose fee types of their choice if they have fewer than two fee types that require disclosure under final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix), thereby creating opportunities for more transparent disclosure to consumers and greater flexibility and control for financial institutions, including the option of highlighting innovative and unique product features or features that financial institutions project may require disclosure by the next reassessment and update deadline.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Also in the final rule, the Bureau is requiring disclosure of two additional fee types pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A), rather than three as proposed. The Bureau has made this modification, in part, to create additional space on the short form for other disclosures required by the final rule, such as the statement associated with the alternate disclosure of a variable periodic fee pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(3)(ii). The Bureau also believes some financial institutions will find that this modification will impose less burden on an ongoing basis with respect to recalculation and updates than the rule as proposed would have done. The Bureau does not believe that the disclosure of two additional fee types rather than three will reduce the effectiveness of the short form disclosure for consumers, especially when balanced with other measures the Bureau has taken in the final rule to inform consumers of other fee types, such as the requirement under final § 1005.18(b)(2)(vi) to generally disclose two customer service fees (for interactive voice response and live customer service) instead of the highest fee that would have been required under the proposed rule.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(A)-1 clarifies that a prepaid account program that has two fee types that satisfy the criteria in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A) must disclose both fees. If a prepaid account program has three or more fee types that potentially satisfy the criteria in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A), the financial institution must disclose only the two fee types that generate the highest revenue from consumers. This comment cross-references final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(B)-1 for guidance regarding the disclosure of additional fee types for a prepaid account with fewer than two fee types that satisfy the criteria in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(A)-1 also cross-references final comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-2 for guidance on and examples of fee types. To address an industry commenter's concerns regarding categorization of fee types, comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-2 provides concrete guidance on how to categorize fee types. The comment provides an explanation of the term “fee type” and examples of more than a dozen fee types, along with fee variations within those fee types, that a financial institution may use when determining both the number of additional fee types charged pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) and any additional fee types to disclose pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). In response to the recommendation of one consumer group commenter, this comment provides standardized terms for many fee types, including bill payment. Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(A)-2 explains that commonly accepted or readily understandable abbreviations may be used as needed for additional fee types and fee variations disclosed pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix), and offers several example to illustrate this concept.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Highest revenue.</em> Upon consideration of the comments and additional analysis, the Bureau has concluded that determining the disclosure of additional fee types on the basis of revenue is superior to an incidence-based system. The Bureau agrees with consumer group commenters that there may be more merit in alerting consumers to fees from which the financial institution makes the highest revenue, even if those fees impact fewer consumers, rather than lower fees incurred by consumers more frequently. Also, as raised by consumer group commenters, the rule as proposed could incent some financial institutions to reduce the cost of the most common fee types in favor of higher fees on fee types incurred less often, thus hiding potential costly charges. Moreover, all industry commenters who responded to the issue were neutral as to whether the disclosure should be based on incidence or revenue because they tracked both. To the extent that some financial institutions do not track both, the Bureau believes that it is more likely they track revenue and, regardless, that it will be simpler and more straightforward for financial institutions to calculate fee revenues rather than fee incidence.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also believes that there is additional information conveyed in using revenue; namely that a fee type's revenue is a measure of the impact of that fee type on consumers—it is the amount, in dollars, of the cost of that feature to consumers. In contrast, an incidence-based approach could have led to disclosure of fee types that were commonly incurred but had a low impact because the fee amount was low.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Revenue from consumers.</em> The Bureau has included specific reference in the final rule to “revenue from consumers” to assure clarity that the revenue required for calculation for the disclosure of additional fee types required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) is based on fee types that the financial institution may charge consumers. Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(A)-3 clarifies that the calculation excludes other revenue sources such as revenue generated from interchange fees and fees paid by entities that sponsor prepaid account programs for financial disbursements (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> government agencies and employers). The comment also explains that the calculation excludes third-party fees, unless they are imposed for services performed on behalf of the financial institution.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Assessing revenue within and across prepaid account programs to determine disclosure of additional fee types.</em> Some industry commenters said the proposed requirement to calculate incidence-based fees on a program-by-program basis would pose significant cost and burden to them. They explained that some financial institutions administer hundreds or more prepaid account programs, particularly in the payroll and government benefit space, and recommended that financial institutions be permitted to aggregate data rather than analyze the data of each prepaid account program separately. The Bureau continues to believe it is crucial that the additional fee types disclosed to consumers in the short form reflect consumer usage and cost for a particular prepaid account program. However, the Bureau also recognizes that many payroll card account and government benefit account programs may be considered separate programs but share fee schedules and other terms. Because of the potential burden for determining the additional fee disclosures based on fee revenue data separately for programs that all share the same fee schedule, particularly in the context of payroll card accounts and government benefits accounts, the final rule permits financial institutions to make their additional fee types determination based on the fee types that generate the highest revenue from consumers for a particular prepaid account program or across prepaid account programs that share the same fee schedule during the time period provided in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D) and (E).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(A)-4 explains that, if a financial institution offers more than one prepaid account program, unless the programs share the same fee schedule, the financial institution must consider the fee revenue data separately for each prepaid account program and not consolidate the fee revenue data across prepaid account programs. The comment explains that prepaid account programs are deemed to have the same fee schedules if they charge the same fee amounts, including offering the same fee waivers and fee reductions for the same features. The comment also provides examples of how to assess revenue within and across prepaid account programs to determine the disclosure of additional fee types. In addition, the comment explains that, for multiple service plans disclosed pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), a financial institution must consider revenue across all of those plans in determining the disclosure of additional fee types for that program.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that, financial institutions disclosing only the default service plan for a prepaid account program offering multiple service plans pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) are not required to evaluate revenues or disclose additional fee types under § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) for service plans other than the default service plan.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Exclusions pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(1) through (3).</em> As clarified in final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(A)-5, once the financial institution has calculated the fee revenue data for the prepaid account program or across prepaid account programs that share the same fee schedule during the appropriate time period, it must remove from consideration the categories excluded pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) through (<em data-original="E-03">3</em>) before determining the fee types, if any, that generated the highest revenue.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Exclusion of fee types required to be disclosed elsewhere pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(1).</em> Like the proposed rule, the final rule requires financial institutions to exclude from the additional fee types required to be disclosed (and from the number of additional fee types required to be disclosed pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A)) the static fees required to be disclosed in the short form pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (vii). A new provision in the final rule, § 1005.18(b)(5), requires the disclosure of certain information, including any purchase price or activation fee for a prepaid account, outside the short form disclosure. Because purchase price and activation fees will thus always be disclosed for prepaid accounts under the final rule, the Bureau does not believe it is necessary or appropriate for such fees to be potentially disclosed as additional fee types under final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix), as was proposed, and thus has added an exclusion for those fees as well. Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(A)-5.i provides further clarification regarding the exclusion for fees required to be disclosed elsewhere, including clarification that fee types such as those for international ATM withdrawals and international ATM balance inquiries are not excluded as potential additional fee types.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">De minimis exclusion pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(2).</em> In the final rule, the Bureau is adopting a de minimis threshold permitting exclusion from the additional fee types required to be disclosed of any fee types that generated less than 5 percent of the total revenue from consumers for the prepaid account program or across prepaid account programs that share the same fee schedule during the time period provided in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D) and (E). Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(A)-5.ii provides two examples illustrating the de minimis exclusion; the second example also cross-references final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(B)-1. While the Bureau solicited comments on whether the final rule should establish a de minimis threshold for updating the proposed incidence-based fees, some industry commenters recommended a de minimis threshold for the disclosure of such fees in general, which is what the Bureau is adopting in this final rule.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau understands from some industry commenters that many fees that would have qualified under the proposal as additional fee types neither generate significant revenue nor are charged very frequently, though they often relate to services that certain consumers find valuable. With the de minimis threshold, disclosure of such fee types under final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) would not be required, although such fee types would be counted in the total number of additional fee types disclosed pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii). Even with a de minimis exclusion, the Bureau believes that this disclosure requirement removes the potential incentive for financial institutions to restructure their fee schedules to avoid disclosure on the short form of certain fees from which they garner significant revenue. The short form disclosure likewise still remains dynamic such that it can reflect significant changes in the marketplace and in consumer use patterns over time. The Bureau believes the dynamic disclosures may also be useful to reflect the fees of certain types of prepaid accounts, such as mobile wallets, that are less likely to charge the types of fees that are represented in the static portion of the short form.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Moreover, with a de minimis threshold, this disclosure requirement will impose less burden relative to the proposal on financial institutions whose potential additional fee types fall below the de minimis threshold, as they may but are not required to disclose or update those fee types under final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). The Bureau acknowledges, as pointed out by industry commenters, that some fee types may not be germane to all consumers. The Bureau believes that by applying a de minimis threshold, additional fee types that will not be germane to most consumers are not likely to be required to be disclosed. In response to the consumer group commenter that urged prohibiting any fee so small as to fall below a de minimis threshold, the Bureau states that such request is outside the scope of this rulemaking. The Bureau acknowledges the consumer group commenter's concerns regarding high fees with low incidence, but believes that the de minimis exception, in combination with the disclosure of additional fee types based on revenue, as opposed to incidence, strikes the appropriate balance for the final rule.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>After determining that a de minimis exclusion from the requirement to disclose additional fee types would be appropriate, the Bureau considered recent studies as well as information provided by commenters to determine an appropriate threshold. A 2012 study offered statistics on the aggregate fees paid by cardholders to the prepaid issuer, using data from more than 3 million prepaid cards across 15 programs from one issuing bank.<footnote ref="414">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 2012 FRB Philadelphia Study at 4, 11, and 26. This study used transactions covering a six-year cycle, but most occurred during the last two years of the data set (2009 and 2010). Programs included three web GPR programs, six GPR programs sold at retail, one GPR program offered in bank branches, and three payroll card programs. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See id.&lt;/em&gt; at 11.</footnote>
             For the payroll card programs, approximately 89 percent of the fees (by value) paid by cardholders were from fees that appear to align with those required to be disclosed on the static portion of the short form under the final rule.<footnote ref="415">These fees were ATM withdrawal (54 percent), PIN POS purchase (14 percent), balance inquiry (11 percent), maintenance (10 percent). &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See id.&lt;/em&gt; at 59 fig. 5.1(B).</footnote>
             The remaining fees ranged between 1 and 7 percent.<footnote ref="416">These fees were ATM decline (7 percent), PIN POS decline (1 percent), and other/unidentified (3 percent). &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See id.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
             The study's fee analysis for the various types of GPR card programs were less instructive, having been evaluated across only three general categories (ATM withdrawal fees, maintenance and origination fees, and transaction and other fees).<footnote ref="417">In the web GPR programs, these fees were ATM withdrawal (26 percent), maintenance and origination (52 percent), and transaction and other (22 percent). &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See id.&lt;/em&gt; at 60 fig. 5.2(B). In the retail GPR programs, these fees were ATM withdrawal (17 percent), maintenance and origination (28 percent), and transaction and other (55 percent). &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See id.&lt;/em&gt; at 61 fig. 5.3(B). In the FI GPR program, these fees were ATM withdrawal (19 percent), maintenance and origination (68 percent), and transaction and other (13 percent). &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See id.&lt;/em&gt; at 62 fig. 5.4(B). The category of transaction and other fees here were calculated as the residual of all fees less origination, maintenance, and ATM withdrawal fees, which include, for example, fees for point-of-sale transactions, balance inquires, paper statements, and calls to a live customer service agent. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g., id.&lt;/em&gt; at 60 note 2.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>A 2014 study evaluated transactions on more than 3 million GPR cards from one program manager over a one-year period in 2011-2012.<footnote ref="418">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 2012 FRB Kansas City Study at 4.</footnote>
             Approximately 96 percent of the fees (by value) paid by cardholders in these programs were from fees that appear to align with those required to be disclosed on the static portion of the short form or outside the short form pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(5) under the final rule.<footnote ref="419">These fees were signature transaction (36.7 percent), PIN transaction (19.5 percent), ATM withdrawal (15.9 percent), monthly fee (8.7 percent), account maintenance (8.5 percent), IVR balance inquiry (5.6 percent), and ATM balance inquiry (1.2 percent). &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See id.&lt;/em&gt; at 67 fig. 5.1.</footnote>
             The remaining fees were 1.5 and 2.5 percent.<footnote ref="420">These fees were decline (1.5 percent) and other (2.5 percent). &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See id.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
             The Bureau notes that the data used in these studies is at least four years old, while fee structures on prepaid accounts have generally been shifting to be both lower and more simplified in recent years.<footnote ref="421">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; Fed.

          </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also received information from several commenters regarding fee revenue for a number of prepaid account programs. These commenters provided data mainly for GPR programs, but the Bureau received some information regarding corporate disbursement cards and non-reloadable cards sold at retail as well. Based on this information, across all of these programs except one, fee revenue from consumers amounted to 97 to 99 percent of fee revenue from fees required to be disclosed on the static portion of the short form or outside the short form pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(5) under the final rule. Of the remaining fees, fee revenue ranged from 3 percent to a fraction of 1 percent. In the one other program, 79 percent of fee revenue was from fees required to be disclosed on the static portion of the short form. Of the remaining fees, one comprised approximately 18 percent of fee revenue, while the others ranged between 1 and 2 percent each.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>After considering the requests from commenters for a de minimis exclusion and the information available in studies and provided by commenters, the Bureau believes that a 5 percent threshold is appropriate and offers a clear dividing line between fee types that generate only a small amount of revenue from consumers and those that generate significant revenue and thus are most important to be disclosed to consumers prior to acquisition of a prepaid account. Based on this information, the Bureau believes that this threshold level would facilitate compliance and reduce burden, as requested by industry commenters, because a 5 percent de minimis threshold would exclude a majority of the applicable fees (other than the fees disclosed on the static portion of the short form disclosure or outside the short form disclosure pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(5)) that generate a small amount of revenue and would be less germane to consumers. At the same time, the Bureau believes that the 5 percent threshold appropriately tailors the additional fee type disclosure requirement to ensure consumers are alerted to fees that would potentially impose significant costs. In addition, the Bureau believes that the 5 percent threshold helps effectuate the intent of the dynamic portion of the short form disclosure to reflect significant changes in the marketplace and in consumer use patterns over time. The Bureau intends to monitor developments in the market in this area.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Exclusion for certain credit-related fees pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(3).</em> The final rule requires financial institutions to exclude from disclosure as additional fee types any finance charges as described in final Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11) imposed in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in final § 1026.61. Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(A)-5.iii clarifies that, pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), such finance charges are also excluded from the number of additional fee types disclosed.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail below, the Bureau has made a strategic decision to focus the bulk of the short form disclosure on usage of the prepaid account itself (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the asset feature of the prepaid account). The possibility that consumers may be offered an overdraft credit feature for use in connection with the prepaid account is addressed in the short form pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(x), which requires the following statement if such a feature may be offered: “You may be offered overdraft/credit after [x] days. Fees would apply.” Consistent with this overall decision, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to exclude any finance charges related to an overdraft credit feature that may be offered at a later date to some prepaid consumers from the disclosures regarding additional fees under both final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii) and (ix). If consumers are interested in such a feature, they can look to the Regulation Z disclosures in the long form pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(4)(vii), discussed below, for more details.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that the calculation for the disclosure of additional fee types does not include fees that are not imposed with respect to the prepaid account program. For example, any finance charges imposed in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, where such finance charges are imposed on the separate credit account (not on the prepaid account) would not be included as part of the denominator used in calculating whether the two additional fee types that generated the highest revenue from consumers of a particular prepaid account program qualify for the de minimis exclusion in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>).</analysisParagraph>

           Accordingly, the Bureau proposed to add comment 31(b)(2)-4 to explain that: (1) Providers could satisfy the requirement to disclose the Bureau's Web site by disclosing the Web address shown on Model Forms A-31, A-32, A-34, A-35, A-39, and A-40 of appendix A, (2) alternatively, providers could, but were not required to, disclose the Bureau's remittance-specific Web site, currently, <em data-original="E-03">www.consumerfinance.gov/sending-money,</em> and (3) providers making disclosures in a language other than English could, but were not required to, disclose a Bureau Web site that would provide information for consumers in the relevant language, if such Web site exists.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Commenters generally expressed support for the proposed comment. Several commenters, however, sought additional confirmation that the proposed optional disclosures would remain optional. In addition, a consumer group sought confirmation that providers would only be permitted to provide a link to the Bureau's non-English Web site where the disclosure was provided in that same non-English language.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As the Bureau stated in both the proposed comment text and the discussion of that text in the preamble of the April Proposal, the alternative disclosures included in comment 31(b)(2)-4 are <em data-original="E-03">optional,</em> and do not require remittance transfer providers to change existing receipts. Thus, while it urges providers to provide consumers with the most relevant, updated information available from the Bureau, the Bureau confirms that, at this time, providers can continue to disclose the Web site previously listed on all Model Forms. Likewise, the April Proposal was clear that providers may only disclose the Bureau's non-English Web site if they make disclosures in the “relevant” language used in the non-English Web site. The Bureau will publish a list of any URLs it maintains containing specific information about remittances in foreign languages on its Web site, currently, <em data-original="E-03">http://www.consumerfinance.gov/remittances-transfer-rule-amendment-to-regulation-e/.</em>
        </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For the reasons above, the Bureau is adopting proposed new comment 31(b)(2)-4 substantially as proposed, with minor revisions to include references to revised URLs and revised model forms that illustrated the alternative disclosures proposed by the comment. Specifically, the URLs for the English- and Spanish-language, remittance-specific Web sites are <em data-original="E-03">consumerfinance.gov/sending-moneyandconsumerfinance.gov/envois,</em> respectively. The comment also clarifies that the Bureau will make available a list of other foreign-language URLs for Web sites that provide specific information about remittance transfers. In addition, to accommodate new comment 31(b)(2)-4, the Bureau is renumbering current comments 31(b)(2)-4, -5, and -6 as comments 31(b)(2)-5, -6, and -7, respectively, without any other changes. Finally, the Bureau is revising forms A-31 and A-40 of appendix A to illustrate the optional disclosures set forth in new comment 31(b)(2)-4. The other Model Forms remain unchanged.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Fee Variations in Additional Fee Types Required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(C)</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(C) provides that, if an additional fee type required to be disclosed pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A) has more than two fee variations, or when providing a short form disclosure for multiple service plans pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), the financial institution must disclose the name of the additional fee type and the highest fee amount in accordance with § 1005.18(b)(3)(i). It goes on to say that, except when providing a short form disclosure for multiple service plans pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), if an additional fee type has two fee variations, the financial institution must disclose the name of the additional fee type together with the names of the two fee variations and the fee amounts in a format substantially similar to that used to disclose the two-tier fees required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(v) and (vi) and in accordance with final § 1005.18(b)(7)(ii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>). Finally, it states that, if a financial institution only charges one fee under a particular fee type, the financial institution must disclose the name of the additional fee type and the fee amount; it may, but is not required to, disclose also the name of the one fee variation, if any, for which the fee amount is charged, in a format substantially similar to that used to disclose the two-tier fees required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(v) and (vi), except that the financial institution would disclose only the one fee variation name and fee amount instead of two.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(C)-1 provides examples to illustrate disclosures when a financial institution charges two or more fee variations under a particular fee type, including how to disclose two fee variations with different fee amounts, two fee variations with like fee amounts, more than two variations, and multiple service plans with two fee variations. Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(C)-2 provides an example illustrating the options for disclosing a fee type with only one fee variation.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has included § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(C) in the final rule to create consistency in the short form disclosure by conforming the requirements for disclosure of fee variations for additional fee types with the requirements for disclosure of fee variations for the static fees disclosed pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (vii). In addition, this provision will give consumers the opportunity to see more detailed information about fee variations and their respective costs as well as to allow financial institutions flexibility to disclose more details about discrete fee variations. This provision, together with final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(B) which permits financial institutions to disclose fee types of their choice if they have fewer than two fee types that are required to be disclosed under final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A), creates opportunities for more transparent disclosure to consumers and greater flexibility and control for financial institutions.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Disclosure of Fewer Than Two Additional Fee Types Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(B)</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(B) provides that a financial institution that has only one additional fee type that satisfies the criteria in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A) must disclose that one additional fee type; it may, but is not required to, also disclose another additional fee type of its choice. A financial institution that has no additional fee types that satisfy the criteria in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A) is not required to make a disclosure under final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix); it may, but is not required to, disclose one or two fee types of its choice. Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(B)-1 contains several examples to provide guidance on the additional fee types disclosure pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(B) for a prepaid account with fewer than two fee types that satisfy the criteria in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A). Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(B)-2 clarifies that, pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(3)(vi), a financial institution may not disclose any finance charges as a voluntary additional fee disclosure under final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(B).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has included this provision in the final rule to clarify the disclosure requirements for a financial institution that has fewer than two additional fee types that neither exceed the de minimis threshold nor otherwise satisfy the criteria in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A), given that some financial institutions may have additional fee types that are not required to be disclosed on the short form pursuant to the de minimis exclusion in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>). The Bureau declines to permit disclosure of more than two additional fee types or disclosure of all fee types, as was suggested respectively by one consumer group commenter and two industry commenters, because the Bureau believes adding more information will upset the balance between providing the most important information for consumers with the brevity and clarity necessary for optimal consumer comprehension. However this final rule provision permitting voluntary disclosure of fee types when a financial institution has less than two additional fee types that satisfy the criteria of § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A) does provide flexibility for some financial institutions with regard to their disclosure of additional fee types. A financial institution that chooses to disclose fee types under this provision will be able to more fully inform consumers of the features of a particular prepaid account. Moreover, under this provision, a financial institution that is not currently required to disclose any additional fees, but anticipating that in the future one or two of its fee types may exceed the de minimis exception in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) has the option to voluntarily disclose those fee types in order to avoid the future need to update its short form disclosures pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Assessment and Update of Additional Fee Types Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D) and (E)</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters recommended that the Bureau eliminate the proposed requirement to disclose incidence-based fees based on the burden those commenters said the disclosure would place on industry, particularly with regard to assessing and updating the additional fee types disclosure. As discussed above, however, the Bureau is finalizing the requirement to disclose additional fee types because it believes it will bring significant benefit to consumers. Moreover, the Bureau recognizes that certain industry practices already in place as well as modifications the Bureau is making in the final rule serve to ameliorate some of the burden financial institutions face in complying with final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). For example, the Bureau notes that industry commenters have confirmed that prepaid issuers and program managers already generally track and tag all fees imposed on consumers, typically analyzing both frequency and revenue, thereby collecting similar metrics in their normal course of business as those necessary for assessing and updating the disclosure of additional fee types. In addition, the Bureau has attempted to minimize burden on industry by basing the detailed list of examples of fee types and fee variations in final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(A)-2 on fee classifications used in the current prepaid marketplace.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also notes that, as discussed above, the final rule permits calculation of additional fee types across prepaid account programs with like fee schedules, such that entities that have multiple programs with identical fee schedules, as may be the case particularly with payroll card account and government benefit account programs, may perform a single assessment for all of the programs sharing the same fee schedule.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The specific elements of final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D) and (E) are discussed in turn below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Timing of initial assessment of additional fee types disclosure pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D).</em> Final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) provides that, for a prepaid account program in effect as of October 1, 2017, the financial institution must disclose the additional fee types based on revenue for a 24-month period that begins no earlier than October 1, 2014. Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>)-1 explains that a prepaid account program that was in existence as of October 1, 2017 must assess its additional fee types disclosure from data collected during a consecutive 24-month period that took place between October 1, 2014 and October 1, 2017. For example, an existing prepaid account program was first offered to consumers on January 1, 2012 and provides its first short form disclosure on October 1, 2017. The earliest 24-month period from which that financial institution could calculate its first additional fee types disclosure would be from October 1, 2014 to September 30, 2016.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) provides that, if a financial institution does not have 24 months of fee revenue data for a particular prepaid account program from which to calculate the additional fee types disclosure in advance of October 1, 2017, the financial institution must disclose the additional fee types based on revenue it reasonably anticipates the prepaid account program will generate over the 24-month period that begins on October 1, 2017. Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>)-1 provides the example of a financial institution that begins offering to consumers a prepaid account program six months before October 1, 2017. Because the prepaid account program will not have 24 months of fee revenue data prior to October 1, 2017, the financial institution must disclose the additional fee types it reasonably anticipates the prepaid account program will generate over the 24-month period that begins on October 1, 2017. The financial institution would take into account the data it had accumulated at the time of its calculation to arrive at the reasonably anticipated additional fee types for the prepaid account program.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>) provides that, for a prepaid account program created on or after October 1, 2017, the financial institution must disclose the additional fee types based on revenue it reasonably anticipates the prepaid account program will generate over the first 24 months of the program. The Bureau has included these provision in the final rule to set forth detailed requirements for financial institutions regarding the time frame within which and the data from which to calculate the first assessment of additional fee types required to be disclosed in the short form pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). As illustrated in the example in final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>)-1, for prepaid account programs in existence as of the October 1, 2017 effective date of the final rule, the Bureau has built in the additional flexibility of giving financial institutions up to one year, after the 24-month time period from which to draw the data used to calculate the additional fee types, for the financial institution to perform the assessment and prepare its initial short form disclosure. Similar to the proposed rule, the final rule provides flexibility for the financial institution with prepaid account programs in existence prior to the effective date with unavailable data by requiring the financial institution to disclose the additional fee types based on revenue it reasonably anticipates the prepaid account program will generate over the 24-month period beginning on October 1, 2017. Similarly, for new prepaid account programs created on or after October 1, 2017, the final rule provides flexibility for the financial institution to disclose the additional fee types based on revenue it reasonably anticipates the prepaid account will generate over the first 24 months of the program.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In response to the industry commenter recommending against the reasonableness standard under which a financial institution must project revenues for prepaid account programs in certain circumstances (in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) and (<em data-original="E-03">3</em>) as well as in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>) discussed below), the Bureau believes that, although financial institutions will not have actual fee revenue data for such products, they nonetheless will have a reasonable expectation as to which fee types will generate the highest revenue. Moreover, the reasonableness standard is a commonly-accepted legal standard employed across diverse areas of law <footnote ref="422">For example, this standard already is employed in Regulation E in §§ 1005.33(h)(5) and 1005.17(b)(1).</footnote>
             and the Bureau believes it is appropriate to apply here, in lieu of prescribing a complex formula upon which to base additional fee types disclosures for situations such as those set forth above when the a financial institution simply does not have 24 months of data from which to calculate additional fee types.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In response to the industry commenters questioning the validity of data collected over the proposed one-year period and recommending that the Bureau expand the proposed time frame from which to calculate data, the Bureau agrees that 24 months of data, rather than the proposed one year, will improve the data set from which financial institutions calculate the additional fee types and thus is modifying the final rule as set forth above. In response to industry commenters recommending elimination of this disclosure entirely due to the burden of calculating the additional fee types, the Bureau notes that industry commenters have confirmed that prepaid issuers and program managers currently track and tag all fees imposed on consumers, typically analyzing both frequency and revenue, thereby collecting similar metrics in their normal course of business as those necessary for assessing and updating the disclosure of additional fee types and thus, the Bureau does not believe compliance with this requirement will be particularly challenging or burdensome for most financial institutions.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau expects that both the de minimis threshold and the change in the reassessment and update timeframes from one year to 24 months will reduce variation over time in the additional fee types that must be disclosed pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) for each prepaid account or across prepaid account programs that share the same fee schedule, resulting in fewer instances that financial institutions will be required to make changes to the disclosure of additional fee types on their short form disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Timing of periodic reassessment and update of additional fee types disclosure pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E).</em> Final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) provides a general framework for the requirements to reassess and update the additional fee types disclosures required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). Specifically, it states that a financial institution must reassess its additional fee types disclosure periodically as described in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) and upon a fee schedule change as described in final § 1005(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>). The financial institution must update its additional fee types disclosure if the previous disclosure no longer complies with the requirements of final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) sets forth the requirements for the periodic reassessment of the additional fee types disclosures required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). Specifically, it provides that a financial institution must reassess whether its previously disclosed additional fee types continue to comply with the requirements of final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) every 24 months based on revenue for the previous 24-month period. The financial institution must complete this reassessment and update its disclosures, if applicable, within three months of the end of the 24-month period, except as provided in the update printing exception in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">4</em>).<footnote ref="423">Pursuant to this provision, under certain circumstances, a financial institution is not required to update the listing of additional fee types within the timeframes provided under final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E).</footnote>
             A financial institution may, but is not required to, carry out this reassessment and update, if applicable, more frequently than every 24 months, at which time a new 24-month period commences.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>)-1 provides guidance regarding the periodic assessment and, if applicable, update of the disclosure of additional fee types pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix), including examples addressing reassessment when there is no change in the additional fee types disclosed, when there has been a change in the additional fee types disclosed, and when a voluntarily-disclosed additional fee type later qualifies as an additional fee type required to be disclosed pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>)-2 provides guidance regarding a voluntary reassessment that occurs more frequently than every 24 months, including an example illustrating the concept.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>) sets forth the requirements for the reassessment and update of additional fee types disclosures required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) when there is a change in the fee schedule of a prepaid account program. Specifically, it provides that if a financial institution revises the fee schedule for a prepaid account program, it must determine whether it reasonably anticipates that the previously disclosed additional fee types will continue to comply with the requirements of final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) for the 24 months following implementation of the fee schedule change. If the financial institution reasonably anticipates that the previously disclosed additional fee types will not comply with the requirements of final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix), it must update the disclosure based on its reasonable anticipation of what those additional fee types will be at the time the fee schedule change goes into effect, except as provided in the update printing exception in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">4</em>). In this case, the stale forms would therefore be accurate except for the fact that the disclosure of additional fee types would not reflect the expectations of the financial institution going forward for which fee types will garner the highest revenue from consumers. The Bureau is thus adopting the update printing exception in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">4</em>) to make clear that a financial institution will not be liable for such a result.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>At the same time, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b) above, the Bureau does not believe that financial institutions change the fee schedules for prepaid accounts often, and that financial institutions may need to pull and replace card packaging in some circumstances anyway.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>) also addresses situations in which an immediate change in terms and conditions is necessary to maintain or restore the security of an account or an EFT system as described in § 1005.8(a)(2) and that change affects the prepaid account program's fee schedule. In that case, the financial institution must complete its reassessment and update its disclosures, if applicable, within three months of the date it makes the change permanent, except as provided in the update printing exception in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">4</em>). Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>)-1 provides guidance regarding how to handle the disclosure of additional fee types if a financial institution revises the fee schedule for a prepaid account program, including examples addressing when the financial institution reasonably anticipates that the previously disclosed additional fee types will continue to comply with final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) and when it reasonably anticipates that they will not. The comment also clarifies that a fee schedule change resets the 24-month period for assessment; a financial institution must comply with the requirements of final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) at the end of the 24-month period following implementation of the fee schedule change.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">4</em>) provides an exception to the update requirements of final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E). Specifically, it states that, notwithstanding the requirements to update additional fee types disclosures in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E), a financial institution is not required to update the listing of additional fee types disclosed that are provided on, in, or with prepaid account packaging materials that were manufactured, printed, or otherwise produced prior to a periodic reassessment and update pursuant to final § 1005.(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) or prior to a fee schedule change pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>). Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">4</em>)-1 clarifies application of the update printing exception to prepaid accounts sold in retail locations and provides an example illustrating the timing of the exception.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with industry and consumer group commenters recommending longer time periods between periodic assessments and updates (if applicable) that the change from one year to two may improve the data set from which to calculate additional fee types because, absent structural changes to the prepaid account program, revenue garnered from additional fee types above the de minimis threshold in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) is unlikely to change in a one-year period. Moreover, the Bureau believes changes in the additional fee types disclosed will occur relatively infrequently because the Bureau understands that financial institutions typically do not revise prepaid account fees often. The Bureau also believes this modification will impose a lower ongoing burden on financial institutions with respect to recalculating and updating additional fee types disclosures in addition to smoothing variations in the additional fee types required to be disclosed.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In response to industry commenters' requests for clarification of the time period within which financial institutions must reassess and update (if applicable) the additional fee types disclosure, the final rule explicitly states that both the reassessment and the update must take place within three months of the end of the 24-month period, except as provided in the update printing exception in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">4</em>). The Bureau declines to extend this time period, as recommended by a few industry commenters, as it believes a quarter of a year is sufficient time to perform these tasks, especially in conjunction with the update printing exception in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">4</em>).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also added additional flexibility to the final rule by expressly permitting financial institutions to carry out the required reassessment and update (if applicable) more frequently than every 24 months. As clarified in final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>)-2, a financial institution may choose to do this, for example, to sync its assessment process for additional fee types with its financial reporting schedule or other financial analysis it performs regarding the particular prepaid account program. The comment also explains that if a financial institution chooses to reassess its additional fee types disclosure more frequently than every 24 months, it is still required to use 24 months of fee revenue data to conduct the reassessment, and provides an example illustrating this concept.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>With regard to the provisions regarding fee schedule changes in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>), as discussed above, the Bureau is using a 24-month timeframe to correspond to both the initial additional fee types calculation in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) and (<em data-original="E-03">3</em>) as well as the periodic reassessment in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>). In response to the industry commenter recommending against the “reasonable” standard under which a financial institution must project revenues for prepaid account programs in certain circumstances (in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>), as well as in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) and (<em data-original="E-03">3</em>) discussed above), the Bureau believes that, although financial institutions will not have actual fee revenue data for such products, they nonetheless will have a reasonable expectation as to which fee types will generate the highest revenue. Moreover, as discussed earlier, the reasonableness standard is a commonly-accepted legal standard employed across diverse areas of law and the Bureau believes it is appropriate to apply here, in lieu of prescribing a complex formula upon which to base additional fee types disclosures for situations such as those set forth above when a financial institution simply does not have 24 months of data from which to calculate additional fee types.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>) also addresses the circumstance of a fee schedule change necessary to maintain or restore the security of any account or an EFT system as described in § 1005.8(a)(2). The Bureau believes it is appropriate to include an accommodation in the final rule to address situations where, for example, a financial institution may have to cease offering a particular service for a period of time because of security concerns. The Bureau does not wish such a change due to temporary or exigent circumstances to have negative consequences for financial institutions with respect to their disclosure of additional fee types. Due to the nature of this provision in § 1005.8(a)(2), the Bureau does not expect evasion risk with this accommodation because the Bureau does not foresee any circumstances where it would be appropriate for a financial institution to rely on § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>) to increase a fee amount, add a new fee, or change an existing fee to any amount other than $0.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Similar to the proposed rule, final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">4</em>) provides an update printing exception. The Bureau notes that, despite opposition to the additional fee types disclosure generally by industry commenters these same commenters supported the proposed update printing exception. As stated in the proposed rule, the Bureau recognizes that it could be more complicated and time-consuming for financial institutions to make updates to packages used to sell prepaid accounts at retail. Thus, in the final rule, the Bureau is permitting financial institutions to implement updates on packaging material whenever they are printing new stock during normal inventory cycles. With regard to the possibility raised by some commenters that disclosures for the same prepaid account program may have different additional fee types disclosures depending on the medium of the disclosure (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> electronic disclosures versus disclosures printed on packaging materials for prepaid accounts sold at retail), the Bureau continues to believe that this discrepancy will not significantly impact a consumer's decision regarding which prepaid account to acquire since consumers will most likely be comparing the disclosures for two distinct products, and not reviewing disclosures side-by-side for the same prepaid account found in different acquisition channels.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>While there is a chance that allowing financial institutions to continue to use packaging with significantly out-of-date additional fee types disclosures in retail locations could reduce the effectiveness of the short form disclosure, the Bureau believes that imposing a cut-off date after which sale or distribution of out-of-date retail packages would be prohibited could be complex and would be an overly burdensome requirement to impose on financial institutions on an ongoing basis.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>While the Bureau is finalizing an update printing exception for the additional fee types disclosure on prepaid account packaging materials, it did not propose, nor is it finalizing, any other specific update requirements with respect to disclosures generally. The Bureau notes that financial institutions generally must ensure all other aspects of pre-acquisition disclosures, whether on packaging materials, online, or provided through other means, are accurate at the time such disclosures are provided to consumers. In this final rule, as in the proposal, the Bureau does not believe that a general disclosure update requirement is necessary for other elements of the short form or long form disclosures provided before a consumer acquires a prepaid account, as a financial institution must continue to honor the fees and terms it discloses to the consumer, at least until such time as it satisfies the change-in-terms requirements as set forth in § 1005.8(a) and final § 1005.18(f)(2). See the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.8(b) above for a more detailed discussion of the Bureau's expectations regarding changes in terms and the addition of new EFT services.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Assessment and Update of Additional Fee Types Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D) and (E)</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters recommended that the Bureau eliminate the proposed requirement to disclose incidence-based fees based on the burden those commenters said the disclosure would place on industry, particularly with regard to assessing and updating the additional fee types disclosure. As discussed above, however, the Bureau is finalizing the requirement to disclose additional fee types because it believes it will bring significant benefit to consumers. Moreover, the Bureau recognizes that certain industry practices already in place as well as modifications the Bureau is making in the final rule serve to ameliorate some of the burden financial institutions face in complying with final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). For example, the Bureau notes that industry commenters have confirmed that prepaid issuers and program managers already generally track and tag all fees imposed on consumers, typically analyzing both frequency and revenue, thereby collecting similar metrics in their normal course of business as those necessary for assessing and updating the disclosure of additional fee types. In addition, the Bureau has attempted to minimize burden on industry by basing the detailed list of examples of fee types and fee variations in final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(A)-2 on fee classifications used in the current prepaid marketplace.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also notes that, as discussed above, the final rule permits calculation of additional fee types across prepaid account programs with like fee schedules, such that entities that have multiple programs with identical fee schedules, as may be the case particularly with payroll card account and government benefit account programs, may perform a single assessment for all of the programs sharing the same fee schedule.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The specific elements of final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D) and (E) are discussed in turn below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Timing of initial assessment of additional fee types disclosure pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D).</em> Final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) provides that, for a prepaid account program in effect as of October 1, 2017, the financial institution must disclose the additional fee types based on revenue for a 24-month period that begins no earlier than October 1, 2014. Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>)-1 explains that a prepaid account program that was in existence as of October 1, 2017 must assess its additional fee types disclosure from data collected during a consecutive 24-month period that took place between October 1, 2014 and October 1, 2017. For example, an existing prepaid account program was first offered to consumers on January 1, 2012 and provides its first short form disclosure on October 1, 2017. The earliest 24-month period from which that financial institution could calculate its first additional fee types disclosure would be from October 1, 2014 to September 30, 2016.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) provides that, if a financial institution does not have 24 months of fee revenue data for a particular prepaid account program from which to calculate the additional fee types disclosure in advance of October 1, 2017, the financial institution must disclose the additional fee types based on revenue it reasonably anticipates the prepaid account program will generate over the 24-month period that begins on October 1, 2017. Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>)-1 provides the example of a financial institution that begins offering to consumers a prepaid account program six months before October 1, 2017. Because the prepaid account program will not have 24 months of fee revenue data prior to October 1, 2017, the financial institution must disclose the additional fee types it reasonably anticipates the prepaid account program will generate over the 24-month period that begins on October 1, 2017. The financial institution would take into account the data it had accumulated at the time of its calculation to arrive at the reasonably anticipated additional fee types for the prepaid account program.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>) provides that, for a prepaid account program created on or after October 1, 2017, the financial institution must disclose the additional fee types based on revenue it reasonably anticipates the prepaid account program will generate over the first 24 months of the program. The Bureau has included these provision in the final rule to set forth detailed requirements for financial institutions regarding the time frame within which and the data from which to calculate the first assessment of additional fee types required to be disclosed in the short form pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). As illustrated in the example in final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>)-1, for prepaid account programs in existence as of the October 1, 2017 effective date of the final rule, the Bureau has built in the additional flexibility of giving financial institutions up to one year, after the 24-month time period from which to draw the data used to calculate the additional fee types, for the financial institution to perform the assessment and prepare its initial short form disclosure. Similar to the proposed rule, the final rule provides flexibility for the financial institution with prepaid account programs in existence prior to the effective date with unavailable data by requiring the financial institution to disclose the additional fee types based on revenue it reasonably anticipates the prepaid account program will generate over the 24-month period beginning on October 1, 2017. Similarly, for new prepaid account programs created on or after October 1, 2017, the final rule provides flexibility for the financial institution to disclose the additional fee types based on revenue it reasonably anticipates the prepaid account will generate over the first 24 months of the program.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In response to the industry commenter recommending against the reasonableness standard under which a financial institution must project revenues for prepaid account programs in certain circumstances (in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) and (<em data-original="E-03">3</em>) as well as in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>) discussed below), the Bureau believes that, although financial institutions will not have actual fee revenue data for such products, they nonetheless will have a reasonable expectation as to which fee types will generate the highest revenue. Moreover, the reasonableness standard is a commonly-accepted legal standard employed across diverse areas of law <footnote ref="422">For example, this standard already is employed in Regulation E in §§ 1005.33(h)(5) and 1005.17(b)(1).</footnote>
             and the Bureau believes it is appropriate to apply here, in lieu of prescribing a complex formula upon which to base additional fee types disclosures for situations such as those set forth above when the a financial institution simply does not have 24 months of data from which to calculate additional fee types.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In response to the industry commenters questioning the validity of data collected over the proposed one-year period and recommending that the Bureau expand the proposed time frame from which to calculate data, the Bureau agrees that 24 months of data, rather than the proposed one year, will improve the data set from which financial institutions calculate the additional fee types and thus is modifying the final rule as set forth above. In response to industry commenters recommending elimination of this disclosure entirely due to the burden of calculating the additional fee types, the Bureau notes that industry commenters have confirmed that prepaid issuers and program managers currently track and tag all fees imposed on consumers, typically analyzing both frequency and revenue, thereby collecting similar metrics in their normal course of business as those necessary for assessing and updating the disclosure of additional fee types and thus, the Bureau does not believe compliance with this requirement will be particularly challenging or burdensome for most financial institutions.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau expects that both the de minimis threshold and the change in the reassessment and update timeframes from one year to 24 months will reduce variation over time in the additional fee types that must be disclosed pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) for each prepaid account or across prepaid account programs that share the same fee schedule, resulting in fewer instances that financial institutions will be required to make changes to the disclosure of additional fee types on their short form disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Timing of periodic reassessment and update of additional fee types disclosure pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E).</em> Final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) provides a general framework for the requirements to reassess and update the additional fee types disclosures required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). Specifically, it states that a financial institution must reassess its additional fee types disclosure periodically as described in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) and upon a fee schedule change as described in final § 1005(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>). The financial institution must update its additional fee types disclosure if the previous disclosure no longer complies with the requirements of final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) sets forth the requirements for the periodic reassessment of the additional fee types disclosures required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). Specifically, it provides that a financial institution must reassess whether its previously disclosed additional fee types continue to comply with the requirements of final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) every 24 months based on revenue for the previous 24-month period. The financial institution must complete this reassessment and update its disclosures, if applicable, within three months of the end of the 24-month period, except as provided in the update printing exception in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">4</em>).<footnote ref="423">Pursuant to this provision, under certain circumstances, a financial institution is not required to update the listing of additional fee types within the timeframes provided under final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E).</footnote>
             A financial institution may, but is not required to, carry out this reassessment and update, if applicable, more frequently than every 24 months, at which time a new 24-month period commences.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>)-1 provides guidance regarding the periodic assessment and, if applicable, update of the disclosure of additional fee types pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix), including examples addressing reassessment when there is no change in the additional fee types disclosed, when there has been a change in the additional fee types disclosed, and when a voluntarily-disclosed additional fee type later qualifies as an additional fee type required to be disclosed pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>)-2 provides guidance regarding a voluntary reassessment that occurs more frequently than every 24 months, including an example illustrating the concept.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>) sets forth the requirements for the reassessment and update of additional fee types disclosures required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) when there is a change in the fee schedule of a prepaid account program. Specifically, it provides that if a financial institution revises the fee schedule for a prepaid account program, it must determine whether it reasonably anticipates that the previously disclosed additional fee types will continue to comply with the requirements of final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) for the 24 months following implementation of the fee schedule change. If the financial institution reasonably anticipates that the previously disclosed additional fee types will not comply with the requirements of final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix), it must update the disclosure based on its reasonable anticipation of what those additional fee types will be at the time the fee schedule change goes into effect, except as provided in the update printing exception in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">4</em>). In this case, the stale forms would therefore be accurate except for the fact that the disclosure of additional fee types would not reflect the expectations of the financial institution going forward for which fee types will garner the highest revenue from consumers. The Bureau is thus adopting the update printing exception in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">4</em>) to make clear that a financial institution will not be liable for such a result.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>At the same time, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b) above, the Bureau does not believe that financial institutions change the fee schedules for prepaid accounts often, and that financial institutions may need to pull and replace card packaging in some circumstances anyway.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>) also addresses situations in which an immediate change in terms and conditions is necessary to maintain or restore the security of an account or an EFT system as described in § 1005.8(a)(2) and that change affects the prepaid account program's fee schedule. In that case, the financial institution must complete its reassessment and update its disclosures, if applicable, within three months of the date it makes the change permanent, except as provided in the update printing exception in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">4</em>). Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>)-1 provides guidance regarding how to handle the disclosure of additional fee types if a financial institution revises the fee schedule for a prepaid account program, including examples addressing when the financial institution reasonably anticipates that the previously disclosed additional fee types will continue to comply with final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) and when it reasonably anticipates that they will not. The comment also clarifies that a fee schedule change resets the 24-month period for assessment; a financial institution must comply with the requirements of final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) at the end of the 24-month period following implementation of the fee schedule change.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">4</em>) provides an exception to the update requirements of final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E). Specifically, it states that, notwithstanding the requirements to update additional fee types disclosures in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E), a financial institution is not required to update the listing of additional fee types disclosed that are provided on, in, or with prepaid account packaging materials that were manufactured, printed, or otherwise produced prior to a periodic reassessment and update pursuant to final § 1005.(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) or prior to a fee schedule change pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>). Final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">4</em>)-1 clarifies application of the update printing exception to prepaid accounts sold in retail locations and provides an example illustrating the timing of the exception.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with industry and consumer group commenters recommending longer time periods between periodic assessments and updates (if applicable) that the change from one year to two may improve the data set from which to calculate additional fee types because, absent structural changes to the prepaid account program, revenue garnered from additional fee types above the de minimis threshold in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) is unlikely to change in a one-year period. Moreover, the Bureau believes changes in the additional fee types disclosed will occur relatively infrequently because the Bureau understands that financial institutions typically do not revise prepaid account fees often. The Bureau also believes this modification will impose a lower ongoing burden on financial institutions with respect to recalculating and updating additional fee types disclosures in addition to smoothing variations in the additional fee types required to be disclosed.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In response to industry commenters' requests for clarification of the time period within which financial institutions must reassess and update (if applicable) the additional fee types disclosure, the final rule explicitly states that both the reassessment and the update must take place within three months of the end of the 24-month period, except as provided in the update printing exception in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">4</em>). The Bureau declines to extend this time period, as recommended by a few industry commenters, as it believes a quarter of a year is sufficient time to perform these tasks, especially in conjunction with the update printing exception in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">4</em>).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also added additional flexibility to the final rule by expressly permitting financial institutions to carry out the required reassessment and update (if applicable) more frequently than every 24 months. As clarified in final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>)-2, a financial institution may choose to do this, for example, to sync its assessment process for additional fee types with its financial reporting schedule or other financial analysis it performs regarding the particular prepaid account program. The comment also explains that if a financial institution chooses to reassess its additional fee types disclosure more frequently than every 24 months, it is still required to use 24 months of fee revenue data to conduct the reassessment, and provides an example illustrating this concept.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>With regard to the provisions regarding fee schedule changes in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>), as discussed above, the Bureau is using a 24-month timeframe to correspond to both the initial additional fee types calculation in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) and (<em data-original="E-03">3</em>) as well as the periodic reassessment in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>). In response to the industry commenter recommending against the “reasonable” standard under which a financial institution must project revenues for prepaid account programs in certain circumstances (in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>), as well as in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) and (<em data-original="E-03">3</em>) discussed above), the Bureau believes that, although financial institutions will not have actual fee revenue data for such products, they nonetheless will have a reasonable expectation as to which fee types will generate the highest revenue. Moreover, as discussed earlier, the reasonableness standard is a commonly-accepted legal standard employed across diverse areas of law and the Bureau believes it is appropriate to apply here, in lieu of prescribing a complex formula upon which to base additional fee types disclosures for situations such as those set forth above when a financial institution simply does not have 24 months of data from which to calculate additional fee types.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>) also addresses the circumstance of a fee schedule change necessary to maintain or restore the security of any account or an EFT system as described in § 1005.8(a)(2). The Bureau believes it is appropriate to include an accommodation in the final rule to address situations where, for example, a financial institution may have to cease offering a particular service for a period of time because of security concerns. The Bureau does not wish such a change due to temporary or exigent circumstances to have negative consequences for financial institutions with respect to their disclosure of additional fee types. Due to the nature of this provision in § 1005.8(a)(2), the Bureau does not expect evasion risk with this accommodation because the Bureau does not foresee any circumstances where it would be appropriate for a financial institution to rely on § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>) to increase a fee amount, add a new fee, or change an existing fee to any amount other than $0.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Similar to the proposed rule, final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">4</em>) provides an update printing exception. The Bureau notes that, despite opposition to the additional fee types disclosure generally by industry commenters these same commenters supported the proposed update printing exception. As stated in the proposed rule, the Bureau recognizes that it could be more complicated and time-consuming for financial institutions to make updates to packages used to sell prepaid accounts at retail. Thus, in the final rule, the Bureau is permitting financial institutions to implement updates on packaging material whenever they are printing new stock during normal inventory cycles.

      <analysisParagraph>While there is a chance that allowing financial institutions to continue to use packaging with significantly out-of-date additional fee types disclosures in retail locations could reduce the effectiveness of the short form disclosure, the Bureau believes that imposing a cut-off date after which sale or distribution of out-of-date retail packages would be prohibited could be complex and would be an overly burdensome requirement to impose on financial institutions on an ongoing basis.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii) requires financial institutions to provide an electronic history of the consumer's payroll card account transactions, such as through a Web site, that covers at least 60 days preceding the date the consumer electronically accesses the account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to extend this existing requirement in § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii) to prepaid accounts in proposed § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) and to expand the length of time that online access must cover from 60 days to 18 months. The Bureau proposed to extend this time period because it believed that based on how consumers are currently using prepaid accounts, more than 60 days of account history may be, in many cases, beneficial for consumers. While recent account history is important for consumers tracking balances or monitoring for unauthorized transactions, a longer available account history serves a variety of potential purposes. For example, some consumers might need to demonstrate on-time bill payment or to compile year-end data for tax preparation purposes. The Bureau also believed that a consumer may realize during any given year that he or she needs financial records from the prior calendar year and that access to 18 months of prepaid account history would give the consumer six months into the next calendar year. In addition, based on pre-proposal outreach to prepaid account providers and publicly available studies, the Bureau believed that many prepaid accounts provide at least 12 months of account history and that, even if they do not, the cost of extending existing online histories to 18 months would be minimal.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1005.18(b)(1)(iii) requires financial institutions to provide a written history of the consumer's payroll card account transactions promptly in response to an oral or written request, that covers at least 60 days preceding the date the financial institution receives the consumer's request. Similar to the requirement to provide electronic account transaction history, the Bureau proposed to extend this requirement to all prepaid accounts in proposed § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii) and to expand the length of time for which written history must be provided from 60 days to 18 months. The Bureau also proposed to extend to all prepaid accounts existing comment 18(b)-1, which requires that the account transactions histories provided under existing § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii) and (iii) reflect transactions once they have been posted to the account, renumbered as proposed comment 18(c)-1. In addition, the Bureau also proposed to extend to all prepaid accounts existing comment 18(b)-2 regarding retainability of electronic account history renumbered as proposed comment 18(c)-2.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau recognized that in certain situations, consumers' requests for written account information may exceed what would be required under the proposal; therefore, the Bureau proposed to clarify in proposed comment 18(c)-3 those instances where a financial institution would be permitted to charge a fee for providing such information. Proposed comment 18(c)-3 would have included several examples of requests that exceed the requirements of proposed § 1005.18(c)(1) for providing account information and for which a financial institution would be permitted to charge a fee.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 18(c)-4 would have explained that a financial institution may provide fewer than 18 months of written account transaction history if the consumer requests a shorter period of time. If a prepaid account has been open for fewer than 18 months, the financial institution need only provide account information pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) and (iii) since the time of account opening. If a prepaid account is closed or becomes inactive, as defined by the financial institution, the financial institution must continue to provide at least 18 months of account transaction information from the date the request is received. In addition, this comment would have explained that when a prepaid account has been closed or inactive for 18 months, the financial institution is no longer required to make any account or transaction information available. The proposed comment would have referenced existing comment 9(b)-3, which provides that, with respect to written periodic statements, a financial institution need not send statements to consumers whose accounts are inactive as defined by the institution.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received many comments requesting that it modify the time period that must be covered in a consumer's electronic and written account transaction history. Most consumer groups supported the Bureau's proposal to provide at least 18 months of account transaction history, noting the consumer benefits of having a longer time period and arguing that the impact on industry should be minimal because data storage costs continue to decrease and consumers rarely request copies of their account transaction history. These commenters also argued that—contrary to the Bureau's proposal—financial institutions should not be permitted to charge a fee for providing written account transaction history that is older than the required time period, arguing that it should not cost more to print and mail older information than it is to print and mail newer information.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A few consumer groups argued, however, that a 24-month time period would be more appropriate than 18 months because consumers could identify seasonal patterns, and October 15 tax filers could access transactions earlier than March 15 of the previous year. One of these commenters explained that it could take months for unauthorized transactions to be recognized and months or years to complete fraud investigations and resolve disputes with third parties. This commenter also stated that 24 months would allow consumers to access a longer period of account history, which would be particularly helpful to consumers who are unable to print or save transaction history on a regular basis. These commenters also requested that written account transaction histories go back at least seven years, which they said would be consistent with some document retention policies, so that consumers who use prepaid accounts as primary transaction accounts could look up older charges in the event of a tax audit or when applying for a mortgage.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A number of industry commenters, including issuing banks and credit unions, trade associations, and program managers, urged the Bureau to shorten the proposed 18-month time period and, relatedly, stated that financial institutions would need longer than the proposed nine-month compliance period to implement the requirement as proposed. These commenters argued that the potential costs to industry would outweigh any consumer benefit, since, in their experience, consumers rarely request 18 months of transaction history and do not currently use account transaction history for tax preparation purposes. Some industry commenters requested a 60-day time period, which they stated would be consistent with the current periodic statement alternative for payroll card accounts and with the error resolution and limited liability notification requirements under Regulation E. Other industry commenters requested a time period of no longer than 12 months, arguing that most financial institutions do not retain more than 12 months of account transaction history in a real-time online format, and therefore, requiring a longer time period would be problematic for financial institutions. These commenters also stated that 12 months would be sufficient for consumers to manage their accounts and would be consistent with consumer expectation. Several other industry commenters requested that the Bureau instead require financial institutions to provide consumers with a copy of their written account transaction history upon request once every 12 months at no cost and then allow financial institutions to charge a reasonable fee for any subsequent requests made during that 12-month time period. One of the credit union commenters argued that the time period to provide account transaction history should be left to the financial institution's discretion.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several of these industry commenters argued that maintaining 18 months of account transaction history would result in significant costs to financial institutions. These commenters explained that storing and securing such information would lead to operational costs related to upgrading systems, changing record retention policies and procedures, and training personnel.<footnote ref="476">These industry commenters also described specific actions that they believed would increase costs and burden. These included updating data processor systems (or developing interfaces with third-party providers' processing systems); purchasing data storage systems; and redesigning platforms and Web sites.</footnote>
             Several credit union trade associations argued that the proposed time period would be especially problematic for credit unions because they retain limited historical account information in their systems and rely on periodic statements if a member requests information beyond what is in their systems.<footnote ref="477">Under the Bureau's proposal, however, if a financial institution provides a periodic statement, it would not have been required to make available 18 months of electronic account transaction history. The Bureau thus believes these commenters' concerns regarding issues related to retaining a longer period of account history are misplaced.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters explained some of the differences between the types of information needed to make available and provide electronic and written account transaction histories and the costs associated with maintaining each. These commenters stated that generally, information in a real-time, online database is necessary to make available electronic account transaction history, and archived information is retrieved to provide written account transaction history that extends beyond the time period retained in the real-time database. These commenters stated that real-time information is usually archived after 12 months of the account being opened or when the account is closed, if sooner, and typically retained for several years. They explained that real-time information is easier to access, but more expensive to maintain than archived information, and archived information is inexpensive to maintain, but can be difficult to access. These commenters therefore concluded that maintaining 18 months of electronic account transaction information would be costly because maintaining that length of real-time information is expensive. These commenters further argued that responding to one-off requests from consumers for 18 months of written account transaction history would also be problematic because archived information, although inexpensive to maintain, is usually restricted to certain personnel or stored with a third-party processor, who typically charges a fee to retrieve the information. These commenters also argued that mailing account transaction histories that cover a time period longer than 60 days would increase printing and mailing costs.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Despite the costs associated with retrieving archived information, these commenters stated that they would rather provide a longer period of written account transaction history than make available a longer period of electronic account transaction history, given that maintaining electronic history is more expensive. However, because of the cost and complexity associated with retrieving archived information, these commenters requested that the Bureau allow financial institutions to begin accumulating data as of the effective date of the final rule (until they have built up to 18 months of accumulated transaction history), rather than requiring financial institutions to make available or provide the full length of account transaction histories as of the effective date, to alleviate some of the compliance burden.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A few program managers suggested further modifications that they believed would help reduce the costs associated with the proposed periodic statement alternative. Two of these program managers urged the Bureau to allow financial institutions to charge a fee for responding to requests for written account transaction histories. Another requested that the Bureau expressly allow financial institutions to inform consumers that they may request written history that covers less than the required time period.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is finalizing § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) and (iii) with modifications to revise the time periods a consumer's electronic and written account transaction history must cover. Specifically, final § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) requires financial institutions to make available electronic account transaction history that covers at least 12 months preceding the date the consumer electronically accesses the account, instead of 18 months as proposed. Final § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii) requires financial institutions to provide written account transaction history that covers at least 24 months preceding the date the financial institution receives the consumer's request, instead of 18 months as proposed. The Bureau continues to believe that, based on how consumers are currently using prepaid accounts, access to more than 60 days of electronic and written account transaction history will be beneficial to consumers for a variety of reasons, such as monitoring for unauthorized transactions, tracking spending habits, demonstrating on-time bill payment, and compiling year-end data for tax preparation purposes.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>However, based on the response from industry commenters, the Bureau is persuaded that providing 18 months of electronic account transaction history could be particularly burdensome to industry, especially since costs related to retaining electronic history increase as the time period lengthens. The Bureau believes that 12 months of electronic account transaction history is consistent with the length of history consumers expect to access online and should not be problematic for financial institutions since many already provide at least 12 months of account transaction history, as discussed by industry commenters. The Bureau thus believes this revision strikes the appropriate balance between burden imposed on industry overall while, in conjunction with final § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii), ensuring that additional transaction history will be available for consumers who need it. The Bureau reminds financial institutions that neither they nor their service providers are permitted to charge consumers a fee for accessing electronic account transaction history when providing that information as part of the periodic statement alternative pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Considering the costs associated with maintaining electronic account transaction history, as discussed by commenters, the Bureau declines at this time to require financial institutions to provide electronic account transaction history covering a time period longer than 12 months. However, under the final rule, consumers will be able to request 24 months of written account transaction history pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii), which the Bureau believes adequately addresses the various scenarios offered by consumer group commenters as to why consumers may need access to a longer period of account transaction history. In addition, the Bureau does not believe that the time period for electronic account transaction histories should be left to the financial institution's discretion, as requested by one commenter, because consistency across the market reduces any potential for consumer confusion and assures that sufficient history is available for all consumers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With regard to written account transaction histories, under the final rule, consumers will benefit from having access to two full years of transaction information if needed, without requiring industry to absorb the expense of making that length of information available electronically on an ongoing basis. The Bureau declines to require financial institutions to provide seven years of written account transaction history, as suggested by several commenters. The Bureau believes that 24 months of written history upon request is sufficient to meet the needs of consumers and does not believe it is necessary at this time to require financial institutions to provide an even longer written account history upon request at no cost. Based on information received from industry commenters, the Bureau believes the requirement to provide 24 months of written account transaction history, in conjunction with the requirement to provide 12 months of electronic account transaction history under final § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii), strikes an appropriate balance in providing consumers with the information necessary to manage their accounts while not imposing undue burden on industry. As explained by these commenters, maintaining archived information, which a financial institution will likely need to retrieve to provide 24 months of written history, is less expensive than retaining the real-time information necessary for making electronic history available online. Moreover, because, as explained by some commenters, many financial institutions already retain several years of archived data and consumers do not typically request long periods of written history, the Bureau does not believe that maintaining, retrieving, and providing 24 months of written history upon request should be particularly burdensome to financial institutions. The Bureau notes that financial institutions are not required to provide written history for a longer period than what the consumer actually wants; a financial institution may, for example, inform consumers that they may request written history that covers less than 24 months.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, as explained in the proposal, the Bureau anticipates that, in general, written transaction account histories will be sent the next business day or soon after a financial institution receives the consumer's oral or written request. Financial institutions may also designate a specific telephone number for consumers to call and a specific address for consumers to write to request a written copy of their account transaction history.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Regarding industry commenters' concerns about the proposed nine-month compliance period, final § 1005.18(h)(1) imposes a general effective date of October 1, 2017 for this final rule. However, final § 1005.18(h)(3)(i) provides an accommodation for financial institutions that do not have readily accessible the data necessary to make available 12 months of electronic account transaction history pursuant to final § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) or 24 months of written account transaction history upon request pursuant to final § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii) on October 1, 2017. Specifically, in that case, the financial institution may make available or provide the electronic and written histories using the data for the time period it has until the financial institution has accumulated the data necessary to comply in full with the requirements of final § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) and (iii). See the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(h) below for additional information about the final rule's effective dates and related accommodations.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received no comments specifically addressing proposed comment 18(c)-1. Accordingly, the Bureau is finalizing comment 18(c)-1 as proposed. This comment explains that the electronic and written history of the consumer's account transactions provided under final § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) and (iii), respectively, shall reflect transfers once they have been posted to the account. Thus, a financial institution does not need to include transactions that have been authorized but that have not yet posted to the account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received no comments regarding proposed comment 18(c)-2. Accordingly, the Bureau is finalizing comment 18(c)-2 as proposed. This comment explains that the electronic history required under final § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) must be made available in a form that the consumer may keep, as required under § 1005.4(a)(1). Financial institutions may satisfy this requirement if they make the electronic history available in a format that is capable of being retained. For example, a financial institution satisfies the requirement if it provides electronic history on a Web site in a format that is capable of being printed or stored electronically using a web browser.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is finalizing comment 18(c)-3 substantially as proposed, with minor modifications for consistency with the revised time periods in the regulatory text. Specifically, final comment 18(c)-3 clarifies that financial institutions may charge a fee for providing written account transaction history that is older than 24 months. This comment also provides examples of requests that exceed the requirements of final § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii) and which therefore a financial institution may charge a fee. In addition, the Bureau has revised the internal paragraph references to conform to other numbering changes in this final rule.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau declines at this time to permit financial institutions to charge consumers a fee for providing the written account transaction history required by final § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii), as suggested by some commenters. As with the electronic account transaction history required by § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii), the Bureau believes it is necessary for consumers to have free access to at least 24 months of written account transaction history to effectively manage their prepaid accounts. The Bureau believes that charging fees to consumers who make occasional requests for written histories could have a chilling effect on consumers' ability to obtain information about transactions and, thus, to exercise their error resolution rights. The Bureau reminds financial institutions that neither they nor their service providers are permitted to charge consumers a fee for requesting written account transaction history when providing that information as part of the periodic statement alternative pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For the final rule, the Bureau has divided proposed comment 18(c)-4 into two, numbered as final comments 18(c)-4 and -5, to discuss the requirements for electronic and written account transaction history separately. The Bureau is finalizing the portion of comment 18(c)-4 addressing electronic account transaction history, with several modifications. Specifically, final comment 18(c)-4 no longer explains that if a prepaid account is closed or becomes inactive, as defined by the financial institution, the financial institution must continue to provide at least 18 months of account transaction information from the date the request is received. In addition, final comment 18(c)-4 no longer states that when a prepaid account has been closed or inactive for 18 months, the financial institution is no longer required to make available any account or transaction information. Given the revised time periods that electronic and written account transaction histories must cover, the Bureau has also removed from final comment 18(c)-4 the references to written account transaction history and, as discussed below, is adopting new comment 18(c)-5 to explain separately the requirements for providing access to written account transaction history. In addition, the Bureau has revised the internal paragraph references in comment 18(c)-4 to conform to other numbering changes in this final rule and has made several other modifications for clarity.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Specifically, final comment 18(c)-4 clarifies that, if a prepaid account has been opened for fewer than 12 months, the financial institution need only provide electronic account transaction history pursuant to final § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) since the time of account opening. Final comment 18(c)-4 also explains that, if a prepaid account is closed or becomes inactive, as defined by the financial institution, the financial institution need not make available electronic account transaction history. This comment cross-references comment 9(b)-3.<footnote ref="478">Existing comment 9(b)-3 provides that a financial institution is not required to send periodic statements to consumers whose accounts are inactive as defined by the financial institution.</footnote>
             However, if an inactive account becomes active, the financial institution must again make available 12 months of electronic account transaction history. The Bureau does not believe it is necessary to require financial institutions to continue making access to electronic history available for closed and inactive accounts because consumers do not typically expect to access this information electronically once an account is closed or becomes inactive. The Bureau also believes that not requiring financial institutions to provide electronic access for closed and inactive accounts will reduce burden on industry relative to the proposal, and consumers will still have access to such information, if needed, in writing upon request as required by final § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As noted above, the Bureau is adopting new comment 18(c)-5 to explain the requirements for providing access to written account transaction history that had been addressed in proposed comment 18(c)-4. The Bureau is adopting the requirements substantially as proposed, with several minor modifications. Specifically, new comment 18(c)-5 explains that a financial institution may provide fewer than 24 months of written account transaction history if the consumer requests a shorter period of time. This comment also clarifies that, if a prepaid account has been opened for fewer than 24 months, the financial institution need only provide written account transaction history pursuant to final § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii) since the time of account opening. Even if a prepaid account is closed or becomes inactive, the financial institution must continue to provide upon request at least 24 months of written account transaction history preceding the date the request is received. When a prepaid account has been closed or inactive for 24 months or longer, the financial institution is no longer required to make available any written account transaction history pursuant to final § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii). In addition, the Bureau has revised the internal paragraph references in comment 18(c)-5 to conform to other numbering changes in this final rule and has made several other modifications for clarity.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>33(c)(1) Time Limits for Investigation and Report to Consumer of Error</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Consistent with EFTA section 919(d)(1)(B), proposed § 205.33(c)(1) provided that a remittance transfer provider must promptly investigate a notice of error to determine whether an error occurred within 90 days of receiving the sender's notice. Some industry commenters suggested that the time to investigate a notice of error should be extended. One industry trade association commenter stated that for one of its member banks, while international wire “exceptions” (including non-timely delivery) averaged less than 1% of its international wire transfers, more than 15% of these exceptions took longer than 90 days to resolve.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that the 90-day time period is set by the statute. Furthermore, compared to the time period to resolve errors for EFTs (including those a consumer may have initiated abroad), which can be either 10 business days or 45 calendar days, 90 days is twice the length of the longest allowable time period. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.11(c). Although a longer period than the one available for EFTs may be justified given the international nature of these transactions, the Bureau believes that senders should have errors resolved in a timely manner. Consequently, the Bureau does not believe use of its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to extend the statutorily-imposed 90-day period is warranted.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>To effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Board also proposed to include in proposed § 205.33(c)(1) a requirement that the remittance transfer provider report the results to the sender within three business days after completing its investigation. As the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, this timing is consistent with the time frame for reporting the results of an error investigation under Regulation E, § 1005.11(c)(2)(iv). In addition, under proposed § 205.33(c)(1), the report or notice of results would have to alert the sender of any remedies available for correcting any error that the provider determines has occurred.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(d)(1) does not expressly require a notice to be provided to the sender when the provider determines that an error has occurred. However, the Board proposed to require that a notice be given in these circumstances to alert the sender of the results of the investigation, as well as to inform the sender of available remedies. In proposing this requirement, the Board did not propose that the notice to a sender that an error occurred as asserted had to be in writing because such a requirement could unnecessarily delay a sender's ability to receive an appropriate remedy. Accordingly, the Board proposed comment 33(c)-1 to clarify that if the error occurred as described by the sender, the provider may inform the sender of its findings either orally or in writing. If the error did not occur as described, however, the remittance transfer provider would have to provide a written notice of its findings under § 1005.33(d), as discussed below. The Bureau agrees with the Board's reasoning in proposing both § 205.33(c)(1) and comment 33(c)-1. Accordingly, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to adopt these provisions substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(c)(1) and comment 33(c)-1, respectively.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters also requested that the Bureau specify that the burden of proof should be on the remittance transfer provider so that if a sender presents evidence that there has been an error, the burden should unequivocally shift to the remittance transfer provider to show that there was not an error. The Bureau notes that the EFTA establishes various burdens of proof. For example, under EFTA section 909(b), in any action involving a consumer's liability for an unauthorized EFT, the burden of proof is upon the financial institution to show that the EFT was authorized. However, under EFTA section 910(b), a financial institution is not liable for an incorrect or delayed EFT if it can show by a preponderance of the evidence that its action or failure to act resulted from an act of God or other circumstance beyond its control or a technical malfunction known to the consumer at the time the consumer attempted to initiate the EFT. Section 1073 of the Dodd-Frank Act did not amend the EFTA to adopt a specific burden of proof for errors related to remittance transfers that are not EFTs. Therefore, the Bureau does not believe it is appropriate to address this issue.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>33(h)(2)</title>
      <analysisParagraph>In the December Proposal, the Bureau noted that typically remittance transfer providers have no means to verify whether a sender provided account number for the designated recipient is accurate.  Thus, the Bureau did not propose, as a condition of the proposed exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D), that providers verify account numbers before sending a remittance transfer to an account.  However, and as noted above, the Bureau is expanding the exception to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) to include senders' mistakes regarding recipient institution identifiers, as well as mistakes regarding account numbers. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In response to the Bureau's request for comment on sender mistakes generally, some industry commenters acknowledged that, in some instances, institution identifier information provided by senders may be at least partially verifiable.  Foremost among these are BICs (sometimes referred to as SWIFT codes) and other recipient institution identifiers.  Commenters noted, however, that verification is neither ubiquitous nor perfect.  Several consumer group commenters argued, on the other hand, that the Bureau should not expand the exception to mistakes regarding recipient institution identifiers because remittance transfer providers should be able to verify such identifiers. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As a result of the Bureau's inclusion of recipient institution identifiers in the exception to the definition of error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D), the Bureau is adopting new § 1005.33(h)(2), which provides that for any instance in which the sender provided the incorrect recipient institution identifier, prior to or when sending the transfer, the provider used reasonably available means to verify that the recipient institution identifier provided by the sender corresponded to the recipient institution name provided by the sender. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As adopted, § 1005.33(h)(2) will permit remittance transfer providers to rely on the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) only in situations where no reasonable verification is possible or where reasonably available means were applied but were unable to prevent a mis-deposit that occurred because the sender provided an incorrect recipient institution identifier.  The exception does not apply to account number mistakes insofar as the Bureau continues to believe that no reasonable means to verify that an account number matches the name of the designated recipient disclosed to the sender exists today for most transfers. The Bureau will continue to monitor whether expansion of the condition is appropriate.  Furthermore, § 1005.33(h)(2) requires that the verification occur prior to or when the provider is sending the transfer because if the verification occurs later it may be too late to prevent a mis-deposit. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting new comment 33(h)-1, which explains that the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) applies only when a sender provides an incorrect recipient institution identifier, § 1005.33(h)(2) limits the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to situations where the provider used reasonably available means to verify that the recipient institution identifier provided by the sender did correspond to the recipient institution name provided by the sender.  Reasonably available means may include accessing a directory of Business Identifier Codes and verifying that the code provided by the sender matches the provided institution name, and, if possible, the specific branch or location provided by the sender.  Comment 33(h)-1 explains that providers may also rely on other commercially available databases or directories to check other recipient institution identifiers.  If reasonable verification means fail to identify that the recipient institution identifier is incorrect, the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) will apply, assuming that the provider can satisfy the other conditions in § 1005.33(h).  Similarly, if no reasonably available means exist to verify the accuracy of the recipient institution identifier, § 1005.33(h)(2) would be satisfied and thus the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) also will apply, again assuming the provider can satisfy the other conditions in § 1005.33(h).  However, where a provider does not employ reasonably available means to verify a recipient institution identifier, § 1005.33(h)(2) is not satisfied and the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) will not apply.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting this provision because upon further consideration, it concludes that if remittance transfer providers want to avail themselves of the exception to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) for mistakes regarding recipient institution identifiers, they must take reasonable steps to limit the occurrence of these mistakes.  The Bureau believes that, in many instances providers can and currently do verify the accuracy of some identifiers, and that in many other instances verification is not feasible.  For example, many providers require, and senders provide, BICs to identify recipient institutions.  Providers, or their third-party partners, typically have access to a directory in which they can match the BIC with the institution name (and possibly location), and the Bureau believes many providers (or their business partners) perform such verifications today.  The Bureau also recognizes, however, that some providers may not conduct such verification.  In other instances, precise verification that the sender has identified the proper institution may be challenging, particularly if a recipient institution has no BIC code or other type of identifier for which there is an internationally accessible directory, or if a sender has not given all the information about the recipient institution that may be reflected in a numerical identifier, such as the branch location.<footnote ref="10">See &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.swift.com/products_services/bic_and_iban_format_registration_bic_details.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
             The Bureau believes the requirement appropriately requires verification where such mechanisms are reasonable available. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau notes that it intends to monitor the availability of other means to verify account numbers and recipient institution identifiers and it may propose to revise § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) and (h)(2) and the related commentary if such means become reasonably available.

Thus, the final rule requires that the symbols and corresponding statements regarding variable fees disclosed in the short form pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(3)(i) and (ii), when applicable, appear in a minimum type size of seven points (or nine pixels) and appear in no larger a type size than what is used for the information required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(x) through (xiii). A symbol required next to the fee amount pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(3)(i) and (ii) must appear in the same type size or pixel size as what is used for the corresponding amount.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive any comments regarding the prominence and size requirements in proposed § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, and in the absence of comments opposing the specific prominence and size requirements regarding the payroll card account and government benefit account banner notices in the short form disclosure, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>), renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(7)(ii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>), with certain modifications. The Bureau is adopting the final rule with the addition of size requirements for new § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B). The Bureau has also made technical modifications to the rule for conformity and clarity. These revisions have been carried through to final § 1005.15(c)(2), the parallel provision addressing additional content requirements in the government benefit account section.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau continues to believe that the statement regarding wage or salary payment options required in the short form disclosure pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(A) is key information for consumers being offered payroll card accounts to know before they choose whether or not to accept the payroll card account. For this reason, the Bureau believes the type size of the statement should be no larger than, but generally the same size as, the top-line fee headings. Thus, the final rule requires the statement regarding wage or salary payment options for payroll card accounts required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(A), when applicable, appear in a minimum type size of eight points (or 11 pixels) and appear in no larger a type size than what is used for the fee headings required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (iv).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Because the new disclosure permitted for payroll card accounts by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B) regarding State-required information and other fee discounts or waivers is a statement similar to and located near the statements required by final § 1005.18(b)(3)(i) and (ii) and those required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(x) through (xiii), the final rule requires the statement regarding State-required information and other fee discounts and waivers permitted final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B) to appear in the same type size used to disclose variable fee information pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(3)(i) and (ii), or, if none, the same type size used for the information required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(x) through (xiii).</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>To clarify what the Bureau means by account number and recipient institution identifier, the Bureau is also adopting new comment 33(a)-8.  Comment 33(a)-8 states that, for purposes of the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D), the terms account number and recipient institution identifier refer to alphanumerical account or institution identifiers other than names or addresses, such as account numbers, routing numbers, Canadian transit numbers, ISO 9362 or 13616 codes (including International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs) and Business Identifier Codes (BICs)) and other similar account or institution identifiers.  In addition, for purposes of this exception, the term designated recipient's account refers only to an account held in the recipient's name at a bank, credit union, or equivalent institution that maintains savings or checking accounts or accounts used for the purchase or sale of securities.  An account for purposes of this definition is not limited to accounts held by consumers.  For the reasons discussed above, the comment states that the term does not, however, refer to a credit card, prepaid card, or a virtual account held by an Internet-based or mobile phone company that is not a bank, credit union, or equivalent institution. </analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(b)(6)(i)(B) Electronic Disclosures</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Currently, § 1005.4(a)(1) permits disclosures required by Regulation E to be provided in electronic form, subject to compliance with consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act. The E-Sign Act generally allows the use of electronic records to satisfy any statute, regulation, or rule of law requiring that such information be provided in writing, if a consumer has affirmatively consented to such use and has not withdrawn such consent, and if certain delivery format requirements are met. Before receiving such consent, the E-Sign Act requires financial institutions to make clear to a consumer that the consumer has the option of receiving records in paper form, to specify whether a consumer's consent applies to a specific transaction or throughout the duration of the consumer's relationship with the financial institution, and to inform a consumer of how the consumer could withdraw consent and update information needed to contact the consumer electronically, among other requirements. The E-Sign Act also requires financial institutions to retain records of any disclosures that have been provided to a consumer electronically so that the consumer can access them later.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>When the Bureau issued regulations on remittance transfers in subpart B of Regulation E, the Bureau altered the general requirement to provide disclosures in writing, such that pursuant to § 1005.31(a)(2) remittance transfer providers may provide pre-payment disclosures electronically when remittance transfers are requested electronically. Comment 31(a)(2)-1 explains that in such circumstances, the pre-payment disclosures may be provided without regard to the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau similarly proposed to modify Regulation E's default requirements for pre-acquisition disclosures for prepaid accounts. Specifically, proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(iii)(B) would have required a financial institution to provide the short form and long form disclosures required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) and (ii) in electronic form when a consumer acquires a prepaid account through the internet, including via a mobile application. Although the Bureau believed that consumers can best review the terms of a prepaid account before acquiring it when seeing the terms in written form, it recognized that in certain situations, it is not practicable to provide written disclosures. For example, when a consumer acquires a prepaid account via the internet, the Bureau believed that a financial institution could not easily provide written (non-electronic) disclosures to a consumer pre-acquisition.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(i)(B) also would have stated that short form and long form disclosures required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) and (ii) must be provided electronically in a manner which is reasonably expected to be accessible in light of how a consumer is acquiring the prepaid account. In addition, proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(i)(B) would have provided that these electronic disclosures need not meet the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act. Last, proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(i)(B) would have required that disclosures provided to a consumer through a Web site where required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii)(C) and as described in proposed § 1005.18 (b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">11</em>) must be made in an electronic form using a machine-readable text format that is accessible via both web browsers and screen readers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Similar to pre-payment disclosures for remittance transfers, the Bureau believed that altering the general Regulation E requirement for electronic disclosures in § 1005.4(a)(1) was necessary to ensure that consumers receive relevant information at the appropriate time. The Bureau believed that during the pre-acquisition time period for prepaid accounts, it was important for consumers who decide to go online to acquire prepaid accounts to see the relevant disclosures for that prepaid account product in electronic form. The Bureau also said it believes that consumers will often decide whether to acquire a particular prepaid account after doing significant research online, and that if they are not able to see disclosures on the prepaid accounts' Web sites, consumers cannot make an informed acquisition decision. Accordingly, the Bureau believed that, for acquisition of prepaid products via the internet or mobile applications, it would be more appropriate to require financial institutions to provide pre-acquisition disclosures electronically.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, § 1005.4(a)(1) requires that financial institutions comply with the E-Sign Act when providing disclosures electronically. The Bureau did not propose to require such compliance for prepaid accounts that are acquired through the internet or mobile applications. Proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(i)(B) only would have required that electronic short form and long form disclosures for prepaid accounts acquired through the internet be provided electronically in a manner which is reasonably expected to be accessible in light of how a consumer acquired the prepaid account. The Bureau believed that if a consumer has acquired a prepaid account through a Web site, it is reasonable to expect that the consumer would be able to view electronic disclosures on a Web site, and no E-Sign consent would be necessary. The Bureau also noted in the proposal that the requirement in proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(i)(B) would apply only to the pre-acquisition disclosure of the short form and long form disclosures for prepaid accounts acquired over the internet or via mobile applications. It would not have altered the application of § 1005.4(a)(1) to prepaid accounts after acquisition nor to any other type of account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also proposed comment 18(b)(3)(i)(B)-1, which would have explained how to disclose the short form and long form electronically. Specifically, the proposed comment would have explained that a financial institution may, at its option, provide the short form and long form disclosures on the same Web page or on two different Web pages as long as the disclosures were provided in accordance with the pre-acquisition disclosure requirements in proposed § 1005.18(b)(1)(i). The Bureau recognized, as several consumer advocacy group commenters to the Prepaid ANPR stated, that disclosures provided electronically on Web sites may be difficult for consumers to find. Sometimes the disclosures are buried several pages deep or are only accessible to a consumer after the consumer completes some form of registration or otherwise logs onto the Web site. The Bureau generally believed that pre-acquisition disclosures provided on a Web site should be easy to locate, whether they are provided on the same Web page or on two separate pages, as addressed in proposed § 1005.18(b)(1) and proposed comment 18(b)(1)-2.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 18(b)(3)(i)(B)-2 would have provided guidance with respect to the lack of an E-sign requirement for prepaid account pre-acquisition disclosures. The proposed comment would have clarified that, for example, if a consumer is acquiring the prepaid account using a financial institution's Web site, it would be reasonable to expect that a consumer would be able to access pre-acquisition disclosures provided on a similar Web site.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 18(b)(3)(i)(B)-3 would have clarified that a disclosure would not comply with the requirement in § 1005.18(b)(3)(i)(B) regarding machine-readable text if it was not provided in a textual format that can be read automatically by internet search engines or other computer systems.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters, including industry trade associations, program managers, and a digital wallet provider as well as some consumer groups commented on the Bureau's proposal regarding electronic disclosure of the short form and long form. The Bureau received no comments regarding the requirement that disclosures be provided in machine-readable text.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters primarily asked for clarification regarding the placement and treatment of the short form and long form disclosures in an online setting. Some commenters indicated that prepaid cards increasingly will be marketed and acquired via the internet, including through mobile applications and wearable devices. Commenters said that the rule, as proposed, did not sufficiently address how to comply when providing the short form and long form disclosures via these electronic delivery methods. One commenter noted that the prescriptive font size and other form and formatting requirements of the proposed rule remove the flexibility to shrink or resize disclosures to fit onto mobile screens, which could result in a confusing and frustrating user experience in which it would be impossible to view the entire disclosure at once without zooming out to a wider view.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One consumer group supporting the proposed requirement regarding electronic disclosure of the short form and long form urged the Bureau to additionally require that financial institutions also provide the disclosures in writing if they issue physical cards. Another consumer group expressed concern that consumers may not see the electronic disclosures and recommended that the Bureau require they be prominently displayed on financial institutions' Web sites. It also urged the Bureau to adopt specific rules regarding location of the short form and long form disclosures on the financial institution's Web site.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(i)(B), renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(6)(i)(B), with certain modifications. First, the Bureau has added requirements to the final rule that electronic disclosures be provided in a responsive form and viewable across all screen sizes. Second, the Bureau has made technical modifications to the rule and comments for consistency and clarity. Third, in response to the comments discussed above, the final rule and commentary more specifically address how to provide the required disclosures through electronic means. Fourth, in the final rule the Bureau has removed proposed comment 18(b)(3)(i)(B)-2 because it believes the rule is clear that financial institutions may provide disclosures electronically without regard to consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act. Finally, final comments 18(b)(6)(i)(B)-1 and -2 now specifically address access to the required disclosures on Web sites and final comment 18(b)(6)(i)(B)-3, which addresses machine-readable text, is adopted generally as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The final rule requires that the disclosures required by final § 1005.18(b) must be provided in electronic form when a consumer acquires a prepaid account through electronic means, including via a Web site or mobile application, and must be viewable across all screen sizes. The Bureau has added the requirement that these disclosures be viewable across all screen sizes to clarify that they must be able to be seen by consumers regardless of the electronic method used. The final rule also states that the long form disclosure must be provided electronically through a Web site when a financial institution is offering prepaid accounts at a retail location pursuant to the retail location exception in final § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii). The rule also finalizes the proposed requirements that electronic disclosures must be provided in a manner which is reasonably expected to be accessible in light of how a consumer is acquiring the prepaid account, in a responsive form, and using machine-readable text that is accessible via web browsers or mobile applications, as applicable, and via screen readers. Also, the final rule, like the proposed rule, provides that electronic disclosures provided pursuant to final § 1005.18(b) need not meet the consumer consent and other application provisions of the E-Sign Act.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Final comment 18(b)(6)(i)(B)-1 explains the rule's requirement that electronic disclosures be provided in a manner which is reasonably expected to be accessible in light of how a consumer is acquiring the prepaid account. Specifically, the comment states that, for example, if a consumer is acquiring a prepaid account via a Web site or mobile application, it would be reasonable to expect that a consumer would be able to access the disclosures required by final § 1005.18(b) on the first page or via a direct link from the first page of the Web site or mobile application or on the first page that discloses the details about the specific prepaid program. The comment also cross-references final comment 18(b)(1)(i)-2 for additional guidance on placement of the short form and long form disclosures on a Web page. The additions to comment 18(b)(6)(i)(B)-1 respond to comments requesting clarification regarding the required location of the short form and long form disclosures when provided via electronic means.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In response to commenters' concerns discussed above, new comment 18(b)(6)(i)(B)-2 specifically addresses how to provide the required disclosures in a way that responds to smaller screen sizes. The comment clarifies that, in accordance with the requirement in final § 1005.18(b)(6)(i)(B) that electronic disclosures be provided in a responsive form, electronic disclosures provided pursuant to final § 1005.18(b) must be provided in a way that responds to different screen sizes, for example, by stacking elements of the disclosures in a manner that accommodates consumer viewing on smaller screens, while still meeting the other formatting requirements set forth in final § 1005.18(b)(7). For example, the disclosures permitted by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B) or (3)(ii) must take up no more than one additional line of text in the short form disclosure. The comment explains that if a consumer is acquiring a prepaid account using a mobile device with a screen too small to accommodate these disclosures on one line of text in accordance with the size requirements set forth in final § 1005.18(b)(7)(ii)(B), a financial institution is permitted to display the disclosures permitted by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B) and (3)(ii), for example, by stacking those disclosures in a way that responds to smaller screen sizes, while still meeting the other formatting requirements in final § 1005.18(b)(7). The Bureau's source code for web-based disclosures provides an example of stacking.<footnote ref="457">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt;

          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Final comment 18(b)(6)(i)(B)-3, which addresses machine-readable text, clarifies that a disclosure would not be deemed to comply with § 1005.18(b)(6)(i)(B) if it was not provided in a form that can be read automatically by internet search engines or other computer systems. As noted in the proposal, this textual format could include, for example, JSON, XML, or a similar format.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(b)(6)(i)(C) Oral Disclosures</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(i)(C), which would have stated that disclosures required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) must be provided orally when a consumer acquires a prepaid account orally by telephone as described in proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(iii). Proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(i)(C) would have also stated that disclosures provided to a consumer through the telephone number described in proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">11</em>) also must be made orally. The Bureau believed that when a consumer acquires a prepaid account orally by telephone or when a consumer requests to hear the long form disclosure in a retail store by calling the telephone number disclosed on the short form pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">11</em>), it would not be practicable for a financial institution to provide these disclosures in written form, and therefore it would be appropriate for oral disclosures to be provided.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive any comments specific to proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(i)(C) and therefore, is adopting this provision generally as proposed, renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(6)(i)(C), with technical modifications to the rule for conformity and clarity. Specifically, the Bureau has made clear that this provision applies both when a consumer is acquiring a prepaid account in a retail location and orally by telephone. The Bureau continues to believe that when consumers acquire a prepaid account orally by telephone or in a retail location, consumers should nonetheless have the benefit of pre-acquisition disclosures. Thus, final § 1005.18(b)(6)(i)(C) states that disclosures required by final § 1005.18(b)(2) and (5) must be provided orally when a consumer acquires a prepaid account orally by telephone as described in final § 1005.18(b)(1)(iii). For prepaid accounts acquired in retail locations or orally by telephone, disclosures required by final § 1005.18(b)(4) provided by telephone pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii)(B) or final § 1005.18(b)(1)(iii)(B) also must be made orally.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>31(g)(1) General</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(g)(1) provided that disclosures required under subpart B, other than oral disclosures and written receipts for telephone transactions, must be made in English and in each of the foreign languages principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfer services, either orally, in writing, or electronically, at that office. Alternatively, proposed § 205.31(g)(1) provided that these disclosures may be made in English, and, if applicable, in the foreign language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction (or for written or electronic disclosures made pursuant to proposed § 205.33, in the foreign language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to assert the error), provided that such foreign language is principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfer services, either orally, in writing, or electronically, at that office.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, proposed § 205.31(g)(1) contained certain exceptions and clarifications to the requirements of EFTA section 919(b). Specifically, the Board proposed: (i) To apply the provisions only to written or electronic disclosures and address oral disclosures separately in proposed § 205.31(g)(2); (ii) to simplify the statutory language in EFTA section 919(b) by removing the term “or its agents;” (iii) to include electronic advertising, soliciting or marketing as a trigger to the foreign language disclosure requirements, in addition to oral and written advertisements, solicitations, or marketing; (iv) to limit the trigger to foreign language advertisements, solicitations, or marketing of remittance transfer services, and to exclude from the trigger foreign language advertisements, solicitations, or marketing of other products or services; and (v) to permit, under its EFTA section 904(c) authority, a remittance transfer provider to fulfill its obligations by providing the sender with disclosures in English and, if applicable, the one triggered foreign language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction or assert an error in lieu of providing disclosures in each of the triggered foreign languages.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Commenters did not object to these specific proposed modifications. However, several industry commenters stated that the foreign language disclosure requirements generally would provide a disincentive for remittance transfer providers to provide a wide range of foreign language services to customers. Some of these commenters suggested that if remittance transfer providers were to offer fewer foreign language services, this would drive some customers to use illicit operators who provide the foreign-language services discontinued by legitimate remittance transfer providers. Another commenter suggested that the disclosures should only be provided in English because the foreign language requirement would impose costs that would be passed on to consumers who might not derive any benefit from such services.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters and a member of Congress, however, thought the rule should ensure that non- and limited-English speaking consumers have access to meaningful remittance transfer disclosures. The Congressional commenter also agreed with the Board's proposal to extend the advertising, soliciting, or marketing trigger to electronic advertisements, solicitations, and marketing.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(b) requires disclosures to be provided in certain foreign languages, and the Bureau believes the Board's proposed modifications to the statutory requirements alleviates burden on remittance transfer providers. The Bureau believes that proposed § 205.31(g)(1) reflects a proper balancing of interests in providing non- and limited-English speaking consumers with disclosures in a language with which they are familiar with the burden on remittance transfer providers of providing multilingual disclosures in implementing EFTA section 919(b). The statute and the implementing regulation seek to ensure that if remittance transfer providers make a concerted effort to reach out to potential remittance transfer customers through advertisements, solicitations, and marketing in a foreign language in a particular office, then such providers should also be required to provide important disclosures in that language when such customers come to that office to purchase remittance transfer services from that provider or assert an error.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, the Bureau agrees with the Board's proposed modifications and clarifications to the statutory language for the reasons discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, and commenters did not object to such modifications and clarifications. Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA section 904(a) and (c) to adopt proposed § 205.31(g)(1) in renumbered § 1005.31(g)(1), with the removal of a reference to proposed § 205.31(g)(3) regarding written receipts for telephone transactions, which is further discussed below, and other minor technical and clarifying amendments. Most notably, the Bureau is changing the references to “that office” in the proposed rule to “the office in which a sender conducts a transaction or asserts an error” for clarity.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Principally Used</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(g)(1)-1 clarified when a foreign language is principally used. As the Board stated in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the statute indicates that more than one foreign language may be principally used. Consequently, the Board's interpretation of the term “principally used” was not limited to the one foreign language used most frequently by the remittance transfer provider. Instead, proposed comment 31(g)(1)-1 adopted a facts-and-circumstances approach to determining when a foreign language is principally used. Under proposed comment 31(g)(1)-1, factors contributing to whether a foreign language is principally used would include: (i) The frequency with which the remittance transfer provider advertises, solicits, or markets remittance transfers in a foreign language at a particular office; (ii) the prominence of such advertising, soliciting, or marketing in that language at that office; and (iii) the specific foreign language terms used to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfer services at that office. Proposed comment 31(g)(1)-1 also included examples to illustrate when a foreign language is principally used and when there is incidental use of the language. As discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the Board also considered an objective standard based on whether a foreign language meets a certain percentage threshold of a remittance transfer provider's advertisements at a particular office. However, the Board rejected such a standard based on the fact that the standard may be arbitrary, may be difficult to administer, and may inappropriately exclude instances where a foreign language is principally used to advertise, solicit or market remittance transfers, even if the number of advertisements in the foreign language is nominally low.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters suggested that there be further clarification on the term “principally used,” but did not specifically state what kind of guidance would be helpful. A consumer group commenter agreed with the proposed facts-and-circumstances approach for determining foreign languages principally used in advertising, soliciting, or marketing remittance transfer services. A member of Congress agreed with the Board's interpretation that the statutory provision contemplated that more than one foreign language could be principally used.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with the Board's reasoning in proposing comment 31(g)(1)-1. Because the Bureau believes the particular facts and circumstances surrounding the use of a foreign language to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers will determine whether a foreign language is “principally used” to advertise, solicit, or market at a particular office, the Bureau does not believe further general statements would be helpful. However, the Bureau is amending one of the illustrative examples in comment 31(g)(1)-1 to provide a more clear example of when a remittance transfer provider would be considered to be principally using a foreign language to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers at an office.</analysisParagraph>

        <analysisParagraph>Neither the EFTA nor Regulation E defines “advertising,” “soliciting,” or “marketing.” <footnote ref="77">Regulation E contains some guidance on whether a card, code, or other device is “marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate” or “marketed to the general public” for purposes of the requirements pertaining to gift cards. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; comments 20(b)(2)-2, 20(b)(2)-3, and 20(b)(4)-1. However, that guidance focuses on a narrow set of circumstances and does not address more broadly what actions generally constitute advertising, soliciting, or marketing.</footnote>
             However, the general concept of advertising, soliciting, or marketing is explained in other regulations administered by the Bureau. <em data-original="E-03">See, e.g.,</em> Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.2(a)(2) and associated commentary; Regulation DD, 12 CFR 1030.2(b) and 1030.11(b) and associated commentary.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed comment 31(g)(1)-2 to provide positive and negative examples of advertising, soliciting, or marketing in a foreign language. These examples were based on examples from the commentary to other regulations (specifically, renumbered §§ 1026.2(a)(2) and 1030.2(b)) regarding the definition of “advertisement,” as well as examples related to the promotion of overdrafts under § 1030.11(b). Some industry commenters asked whether the terms “market” and “solicit” mean something different than “advertise” and requested definitions for “market” or “solicit” if they are meant to have different meanings. The Bureau believes, that for purposes of subpart B of Regulation E, the terms “advertise,” “solicit” and “market” have the same general meaning, and comment 31(g)(1)-2 is adopted substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>At the Office</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Under EFTA section 919(b) and proposed § 205.31(g)(1), foreign language disclosures would be required when the foreign language is principally used to advertise, solicit, or market “at that office.” As discussed above, the Bureau is changing the reference in § 1005.31(g)(1) from “that office” to “the office in which a sender conducts a transaction or asserts an error” for clarity in the final rule. The Board proposed comment 31(g)(1)-3 to clarify the meaning of “office.” As discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, proposed 31(g)(1)-3 reflected the Board's belief that an office includes both physical and non-physical locations where remittance transfer services are offered to consumers, including any telephone number or Web site through which a consumer can complete a transaction or assert an error. The Board further noted that a telephone number or Web site that provides general information about the remittance transfer provider, but through which a consumer does not have the ability to complete a transaction or assert an error, is not an office. Proposed comment 31(g)(1)-3 also clarified that a location need not exclusively offer remittance transfer services in order to be considered an office for purposes of § 1005.31(g)(1) (proposed as § 205.31(g)(1)), and included an example to illustrate this point.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters requested clarification on whether a Web site targeted to consumers outside of the United States could be an “office” for purposes of the foreign language disclosure requirements. In response, the Bureau is revising comment 31(g)(1)-3 to clarify that because a consumer must be located in a State to be considered a “sender” under § 1005.30(g), a Web site is not an “office,” even if the Web site can be accessed by consumers that are located in the United States, unless a sender may conduct a remittance transfer on the Web site or may assert an error for a remittance transfer on the Web site. Therefore, a Web site that is targeted to people outside of the United States will not be deemed to be an “office” for purposes of § 1005.31(g) so long as senders cannot conduct a remittance transfer on the Web site or assert an error for a remittance transfer on the Web site.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Board also proposed comment 31(g)(1)-4 to provide guidance on the phrase “at that office.” Proposed comment 31(g)(1)-4 stated that advertisements, solicitations, or marketing posted, provided, or made at a physical office, on a Web site of a remittance transfer provider, or during a telephone call with the remittance transfer provider would constitute advertising, soliciting, or marketing at an office of a remittance transfer provider. The proposed comment also clarified that for error resolution disclosures, the relevant office would be the office in which the sender first asserts the error and not the office where the remittance transfer was conducted.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter requested clarification on a number of situations where the remittance transfer provider may be engaging in general advertising, marketing, or soliciting that is not intended to be made at a particular office, but due to the nature of such advertising, marketing, or soliciting, it happens to occur at a particular office. The Bureau agrees that such a clarification is appropriate and has revised comment 31(g)(1)-4 to state that an advertisement, solicitation, or marketing that is considered to be made at an office does not include general advertisements, solicitations, or marketing that are not intended to be made at a particular office. The proposed comment includes an example to illustrate this concept. Specifically, if an advertisement for remittance transfers in Chinese appears in a Chinese newspaper that is being distributed at a grocery store in which the agent of a remittance transfer provider is located, such advertisement would not be considered to be made at that office.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also amending comment 31(g)(1)-4 to provide that advertisements, soliciting, or marketing posted, provided, or made via mobile application or text message would also be considered advertising, soliciting, or marketing at an office of a remittance transfer provider. The amendment is consistent with the Bureau's other revisions in the final rule clarifying that transfers through mobile application or text message are considered to be transfers conducted by telephone. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(a)(5). The Bureau is also making other minor amendments to comment 31(g)(1)-4 for additional clarity, including changing “that office” to “the office in which a sender conducts a transaction or asserts an error” to be consistent with the change the Bureau is adopting in § 1005.31(g)(1). Based on this change, comment 31(g)(1)-4 also contains a clarification that for disclosures required under § 1005.31, the relevant office would be the office in which the sender conducts the transaction.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>31(g)(1) General</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(g) of the 2012 Final Rule explains that disclosures required by the rule must be provided in English and, in certain circumstances, in other languages as well.  Similar to the changes discussed above regarding § 1005.31(a)(1) concerning clear and conspicuous disclosures, the Bureau is making conforming edits to § 1005.31(g)(1) to reflect the addition of the optional disclosures elsewhere in the 2013 Final Rule.  While the disclosures are optional (see §§ 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) and 1005.33(h)(3)), the Bureau believes it is important that they conform to the 2013 foreign language disclosure requirements.  Thus, the Bureau is amending § 1005.31(g)(1) to state that except as provided in § 1005.31(g)(2), disclosures required by this subpart or permitted by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) or § 1005.33(h)(3) must be made in English and, if applicable in accordance with § 1005.31(g)(1)(i) and (ii). </analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(b)(6)(iii)(B) Multiple Service Plans</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As an alternative to proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(iii)(A) (which would have applied to products with a single fee schedule), proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(iii)(B) would have set forth tabular format requirements for prepaid products offering multiple service plans. Specifically, proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) would have stated that when a financial institution offers multiple service plans for a particular prepaid account product and each plan has a different fee schedule, the information required in the short form disclosure by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) through (<em data-original="E-03">7</em>) may be provided for each service plan together in one table, in a form substantially similar to proposed Model Form A-10(f), and must include descriptions of each service plan included in the table, using the terms, “Pay-as-you-go plan,” “Monthly plan,” “Annual plan,” or substantially similar terms. Proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) would have further stated that when disclosing multiple service plans on one short form, the information that would have been required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">8</em>) must only be disclosed once in the table. Alternatively, proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) would have permitted a financial institution to disclose the information required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) through (<em data-original="E-03">8</em>) for only the service plan in which a consumer is enrolled automatically by default upon acquiring the prepaid account, in the form of a table substantially similar to proposed Model Forms A-10(c) or (d). Finally, proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) would have stated that regardless of whether a financial institution discloses fee information for all service plans on one form or chooses only to disclose the service plan in which a consumer is automatically enrolled by default, the disclosures required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">9</em>) through (<em data-original="E-03">14</em>) must only be disclosed once.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the proposal and herein, the Bureau believed that it was important for short and long form disclosures to have a standardized format in order to facilitate consumer comparison of multiple products and the ability to understand key fee and service information about a prepaid product. The Bureau also recognized, however, that financial institutions offering multiple service plans on one prepaid account needed flexibility to disclose information about multiple plans to a consumer. The Bureau therefore proposed that financial institutions may use one short form table that discloses the information required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) for each of the service plans to highlight for a consumer that such plans exist. The Bureau explained that, a financial institution, at its option, could also choose to disclose only the service plan in which a consumer is enrolled upon acquiring the prepaid account using the tabular format described in proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(iii)(A) and note elsewhere on the packaging material or on its Web site the other service plans it offers. The Bureau believed that these options would give financial institutions the flexibility to accommodate disclosure of multiple service plans, while also maintaining the simplicity of the tabular short form and long form designs to facilitate consumers' comparison shopping.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing, some participants were confused by short forms that included multiple service plans similar to the one in proposed Model Form A-10(f). The Bureau therefore also considered proposing that financial institutions must disclose each service plan in a separate short form table instead of allowing financial institutions to disclose all of the plans on one short form. Some participants also were unsure of which service plan applied upon purchase when seeing multiple service plans on one short form, an issue that the Bureau believed may be resolved if a financial institution only discloses the fee schedule for the plan that applies upon a consumer's acquisition of the account. The Bureau thus sought comment on the best way to accommodate prepaid accounts products offering multiple service plans on the short form disclosure while providing accurate and sufficient information to consumers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In the proposal, the Bureau also acknowledged that only disclosing the service plan in which a consumer is automatically enrolled by default upon acquiring the prepaid account could potentially conflict with the requirement in proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(C) that financial institutions would have to disclose the highest fee for each fee type required to be disclosed in the short form. For example, a “pay-as-you-go” plan in which a consumer is enrolled upon acquisition might not impose a periodic fee, and thus, could disclose “$0” in the top line of the short form where the periodic fee disclosure would be required. Under such a plan, if consumers were to opt into a monthly plan, however, they could be charged a periodic fee higher than $0. The Bureau therefore also sought comment on whether the disclosure of only the default plan on the short form would be clear or if the Bureau should require that financial institutions always disclose multiple service plans on the short form.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) would have stated that the information required to be disclosed in the long form by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii) must be presented for all service plans in the form of a table substantially similar to proposed Sample Form A-10(g). The Bureau believed that the long form disclosure should include all fee information about a prepaid account product, and therefore it should contain the fee schedule for every possible service plan.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Additionally, the Bureau proposed comment 18(b)(3)(iii)(B)-1, which would have provided additional guidance on the proposed definition of multiple service plans. Specifically, proposed comment 18(b)(3)(iii)(B)-1 would have stated that the multiple service plan disclosure provisions in proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(iii)(B) apply when a financial institution offers more than one service plan for a particular prepaid account product, and each plan has a different fee schedule. For example, a financial institution might offer a prepaid account product with one service plan where a consumer pays no periodic fee but instead pays a fee for each transaction, and another plan that includes a monthly fee but no per transaction fee. A financial institution may also offer a prepaid account product with one service plan for consumers who utilize another one of a financial institution's non-prepaid services (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> a mobile phone service) and a different plan for consumers who only utilize a financial institution's prepaid account products. Each of these plans would be considered a “service plan” for purposes of proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(iii)(B).</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters, including industry trade associations, a program manager, and an issuing bank, commented on the proposed multiple service plan short form disclosure and recommended that the Bureau adopt a final rule permitting such disclosures for prepaid account loyalty programs and other current and future innovative fee structures. Some commenters asserted that the proposed rule failed to contemplate loyalty programs and thus urged the Bureau to permit use of the multiple service plan short form disclosure for such programs. Commenters also asserted that the rule as proposed would stymie future innovation of new fee plans by limiting use of the multiple service plan short form disclosure to plans already in existence.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several consumer groups urged the Bureau to eliminate the multiple service plan short form disclosure. They believed the multiple service plan short form disclosure compared poorly with the general short form disclosure, saying it was too complex and confusing, defeated the comparison-shopping purpose of the short form disclosure, failed to disclose all the information in the short form (such as the two-tier distinction between certain fees, including the in-network and out-of-network ATM withdrawal and balance inquiry fees), and lacked the top-line emphasis on key fees. Some of these groups also expressed concern that financial institutions seeking to minimize emphasis on certain of their fees might use the complexity of the multiple service plan short form disclosure to hide expensive fees, such as by starting with a pay-as-you-go plan with no monthly fee before disclosing higher fees for other plans.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Some consumer groups suggested that the Bureau require disclosure of the default fee plan in short forms at retail, and require that short form disclosures for the other plans be provided inside the packaging material or at the time the consumer chooses to switch to another fee plan. In other contexts that do not have the same space constraints as retail settings, such as online or at bank branches, consumer groups said the Bureau should require disclosure of separate short forms for each distinct fee plan.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting final § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B) largely as proposed, but has divided the provision regarding multiple service plan short form disclosures to separately address disclosure of the default service plan and disclosure of all service plans.

        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau set forth in proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(iii) the tabular format requirements that would be used to present the short and long form disclosures. Specifically, proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(iii)(A) would have required that, except as provided in proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(iii)(B), short form disclosures required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) that are provided in writing or electronically shall be in the form of a table substantially similar to proposed Model Forms A-10(a) through (d), as applicable. It also would have required that long form disclosures required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii) that are provided in writing or electronically shall be in a form of a table substantially similar to proposed Sample Form A-10(e).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau had observed that most (though not all) financial institutions currently use some sort of table to disclose fees in their prepaid account agreements, although each institution generally selects different fees to highlight and presents them in different orders. The Bureau also noted that financial institutions implement a variety of formats to present fee information on packaging material in retail stores. Thus, the burden is on consumers to identify the fees that are most important to them and find them across various formats to determine the best product for their needs.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing revealed that few participants researched prepaid accounts before acquisition, particularly when they acquired their accounts in retail stores. The Bureau believed that one of the reasons that consumers do not often engage in comparison shopping is because doing so is not straightforward. At retail, prepaid accounts are often displayed behind counters, close to check-out lanes at ends of aisles, and in other often crowded or difficult to access areas which the Bureau believed can limit careful review of a product's terms. The Bureau believed that financial institutions are more likely to present fee information in a clearer and more complete format for prepaid account products offered online, but, as mentioned above, the format used to display this information varies, making comparison shopping challenging. Although some variation is inevitable because each financial institution offers different services in connection with its prepaid accounts, the Bureau believed that requiring use of a standardized form to disclose fee information would be appropriate to minimize variation in presentation format. Additionally, in the case of the short form disclosure, a standardized form also would keep many of the fee types listed constant.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed a sample form for the long form disclosure instead of a model form for the short form disclosure. The Bureau believed long form disclosures could vary depending on the number of fees included in the form and the extent of relevant conditions that would have had to be disclosed in connection with each fee.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>While many commenters critiqued certain aspects of the proposed form and format of the short form and long form disclosures, the Bureau received no specific comments regarding the proposed general tabular format requirement for those disclosures. See the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(7)(i) below for discussion of comments regarding grouping and other format requirements.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, and in the absence of comments, the Bureau is adopting § 1005.18(b)(3)(iii)(A) as proposed, renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(A), with certain modifications for clarity and to set forth more explicitly the content required in the tabular format.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The final rule requires that when a short form disclosure is provided in writing or electronically, the information required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (ix) shall be provided in the form of a table. Except as provided in final § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B), the short form disclosures required by final § 1005.18(b)(2) shall be provided in a form substantially similar to Model Forms A-10(a) through (d), as applicable. The final rule requires that specific sections of the short form disclosure be in a tabular format. The Bureau continues to believe that this standardized format will increase consumer comprehension and enhance comparability among prepaid accounts, thereby creating a system under which consumers have the tools to make improved purchase and use decisions with regard to prepaid accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The final rule, like the proposed rule, also requires that when a long form disclosure is provided in writing or electronically, the information required by final § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) shall be provided in the form of a table. Sample Form A-10(f) provides an example of the long form disclosure required by final § 1005.18(b)(4) when the financial institution does not offer multiple service plans. The Bureau has removed the proposed requirement that the table in the long form be substantially similar to the table in the proposed sample form in favor of the statement that Sample Form A-10(f) provides an example of the long form disclosure. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(4) above, the sample form for the long form disclosure, unlike the model forms for the short form disclosures, does not impose a “substantially similar” requirement. Unlike the short form disclosure, the Bureau believes that the comprehensive content of the long form, together with the wide variety of fees, fee types, and conditions under which those fees are imposed across financial institutions, is likely not suitable for a strictly standardized content and format design.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Because the long form disclosures, unlike the standardized short form disclosure, could vary substantially, the Bureau continues to believe that it is more appropriate to provide a sample form as an example that financial institutions may, but are not required to, incorporate or emulate in their own long form disclosures, rather than a model form that would only provide a safe harbor if financial institutions adhered closely to its parameters. Thus, in the regulatory text of the final rule, the Bureau has replaced any reference to long form content required to be disclosed in a form substantially similar to a sample form with language indicating that the sample form provides an example of the long form disclosure.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1005.31 Disclosures</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Section 1073 of the Dodd-Frank Act imposes several disclosure requirements relating to remittance transfers. Among these, EFTA sections 919(a)(2)(A) and (B) require a remittance transfer provider to provide two sets of disclosures to a sender in connection with a remittance transfer. A remittance transfer provider must generally provide a written pre-payment disclosure to a sender when a sender requests a transfer. This disclosure provides information about the sender's remittance transfer, such as the exchange rate, fees, and the amount to be received by the designated recipient. A remittance transfer provider must also provide a written receipt to the sender when payment is made. This disclosure includes the information provided on the pre-payment disclosure, as well as additional information, such as the promised date of delivery, contact information for the designated recipient, and information regarding the sender's error resolution rights.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(5) provides the Bureau with certain exemption authority, including the authority to permit a remittance transfer provider to provide a single written disclosure to a sender, in lieu of providing both a pre-payment disclosure and receipt. This single disclosure must be provided to the sender prior to payment for the remittance transfer and must accurately disclose all of the information required on both the pre-payment disclosure and the receipt. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> EFTA section 919(a)(5)(C). EFTA section 919(b) also provides that disclosures under EFTA section 919 must be made in English and in each foreign language principally used by the remittance transfer provider, or any of its agents, to advertise, solicit, or market, either orally or in writing, at that office. The Board proposed § 205.31 to implement the content and formatting requirements for these disclosures, and the Bureau is finalizing these requirements in § 1005.31, as discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(a) sets forth the requirements for the general form of disclosures required under subpart B. Section 1005.31(b)(1) and (2) implement the pre-payment disclosure and receipt requirements of EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A) and (B). Section 1005.31(b)(3) sets forth the requirements for providing a combined disclosure, as permitted by EFTA section 919(a)(5)(C). Section 1005.31(b)(4) contains disclosure requirements relating to a sender's error resolution and cancellation rights. Section 1005.31(c) addresses specific format requirements for subpart B disclosures, including grouping, proximity, prominence and size, and segregation requirements. Section 1005.31(d) sets forth the disclosure requirements for providing estimates, to the extent they are permitted by § 1005.32. Section 1005.31(e) generally implements the timing requirements of EFTA sections 919(a)(2) and 919(a)(5)(C). Section 1005.31(f) clarifies that, except as provided in § 1005.36(b), disclosures required by § 1005.31 must be accurate when a sender makes payment for the remittance transfer, except to the extent permitted by § 1005.32. Finally, § 1005.31(g) contains the requirements for providing foreign language disclosures in certain circumstances.</analysisParagraph>

Under § 1005.34(a) of the February Final Rule, a sender generally has 30 minutes after payment is made to cancel a remittance transfer. The February Final Rule, however, contains special cancellation procedures for any remittance transfer that is scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, including a series of preauthorized remittance transfers. For these transfers, the provider is required to cancel the remittance transfer if it receives a request to cancel from the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The February Proposal solicited comment on possible changes to the cancellation requirements for remittance transfers that are scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, including preauthorized remittance transfers. Specifically, the February Proposal solicited comment on whether the three-business-day period for cancelling such remittance transfers adopted in the February Final Rule is appropriate, or whether the rule should require a deadline to cancel these transfer that is more or less than three business days. The February Proposal also solicited comment on three issues related to the disclosure of the deadline to cancel as set forth in the February Final Rule. The first issue was whether the three-business-day deadline to cancel transfers scheduled before the date of the transfer should be disclosed differently to senders, such as by requiring a remittance transfer provider to disclose in the receipt the specific date on which the right to cancel will expire. The second issue was whether a provider should be allowed to describe both the three-business-day and 30-minute cancellation provisions on a single receipt and either describe the transfers to which each cancellation period is applicable, or alternatively, use a checkbox or other method to designate which cancellation period is applicable to the transfer to which the receipt relates. The third issue was whether the cancellation requirements should be disclosed in the pre-payment disclosure, rather than in the receipt, for each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The approaches taken in the final rule for the three-business-day cancellation period and the disclosures required to be provided in connection with subsequent remittance transfers within a series of preauthorized remittance transfers are described in greater detail below in the discussion regarding § 1005.36(c) and (d). Consistent with these provisions, the Bureau is also revising § 1005.31 to add new paragraphs (a)(3)(iv), (a)(5)(iv), and (b)(2)(vii), and associated commentary, regarding the content and format of the disclosures that must be provided to senders of transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer and of certain preauthorized remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Taken together, the final rule requires remittance transfer providers to disclose the date of transfer, and in certain instances, the future date or dates of transfer and related information in receipts that may be provided at the time payment is made or after the date of transfer. For any remittance transfer scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, the receipt provided when payment is made must disclose the date of transfer for that transfer. Where a consumer schedules a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the receipt provided for the first transfer must also provide the date of transfer for that first transfer. In each case, if a second receipt is required after the date of transfer, that receipt must also disclose the date the transfer was made. The final rule also addresses, among other things, a requirement to disclose future dates of transfer for subsequent preauthorized transfers. In addition to the information described above, the receipt provided for the initial transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers must also disclose the future date or dates of transfer for any subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer in that series for which the date of transfer is scheduled four or fewer business days after the date on which payment for the initial transfer is made. For other subsequent preauthorized transfers, the rule provides flexibility as to whether the information regarding transfer dates and cancellation requirements for subsequent transfers is included in one or more receipts or standalone disclosures, so long as it is provided sufficiently in advance to allow the consumer to exercise his or her cancellation rights.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, as is the case with one-time transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, the final rule also requires that receipts for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers include the date of transfer for the transfer that is the subject of the receipt and, if the provider chooses, the future dates of transfer for the next scheduled subsequent transfer or transfers.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>31(a)(3)(iv)</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed below, the Bureau adds new § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii) to require that in certain circumstances, a receipt for a remittance transfer include the date of the transfer for that specific transfer in order to provide consumers with a clearer explanation of their cancellation rights. Further, the Bureau adds new § 1005.36(d) to require that in certain instances, such receipts disclose the dates of upcoming transfers and related information. The Bureau is making corresponding changes to the disclosure requirements for transfers conducted entirely by telephone to require oral disclosure of transfer date information in certain circumstances. As stated in the February Final Rule, the Bureau believes that for oral telephone transactions, senders should be informed of their cancellation rights before the cancellation period has passed. 77 FR 6194, 6217. Because a receipt would generally be mailed to a sender for telephone transactions as permitted by § 1005.31(e)(2), the sender may not receive the cancellation disclosure included in that receipt until after the standard 30-minute cancellation period had passed unless the Bureau required the disclosure to be made orally before the 30-minute cancellation period expires. Consequently, § 1005.31(a)(3)(iii), as adopted in the February Final Rule, requires oral disclosure of cancellation rights when the sender requests the remittance transfer and prior to payment for the transfer, if the provider takes advantage of the option to provide pre-payment disclosures orally for transactions conducted entirely by telephone.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For similar reasons, among others, the Bureau believes that for a remittance transfer scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, and for any preauthorized remittance transfer scheduled to occur four or fewer business days after the date payment is made for the transfer, an oral pre-payment disclosure regarding cancellation rights should be accompanied by an oral disclosure regarding the date of that transfer. Although the time period for cancellation of transfers scheduled in advance may be calculated in days rather than minutes, the period may still expire before the consumer receives any written material, particularly if the consumer is scheduling the transfer three or four days in advance. For preauthorized remittance transfers, several transfers in the series may be sent before a written receipt is received.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, pursuant to its authority under EFTA section 919(a)(5)(A), the Bureau is amending § 1005.31(a)(3) to add § 1005.31(a)(3)(iv) as a further condition for the provision of oral disclosures for remittance transfers conducted entirely by telephone. This provision permits oral disclosures if (among other requirements) the provider discloses orally, to the extent applicable, (A) the information required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii) and (B) the information required by § 1005.36(d)(1)(i)(A) with respect to transfers subject to § 1005.36(d)(2)(ii), pursuant to the timing requirements in § 1005.31(e)(1).</analysisParagraph>

        <title>31(a)(5)(iv)</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis to the February Final Rule, since remittance transfers sent via mobile application or text message on a telephone are conducted entirely by telephone, EFTA section 919(a)(5)(A) permits the Bureau to allow oral pre-payment disclosures in connection with transfers sent via mobile application or text message if the transfer is conducted entirely by telephone. 77 FR 6194, 6217. Because oral disclosures are not retainable, the Bureau further observed that for such transactions, senders would not be less protected, and might be better informed, by receiving pre-payment disclosures via mobile application or a text message even though these disclosures may also not be retainable. <em data-original="E-03">Id.</em> Accordingly, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and facilitate compliance, the Bureau used its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to include in the February Final Rule § 1005.31(a)(5), which states that the pre-payment disclosure may be provided orally or via mobile application or text message if: (i) The transaction is conducted entirely by telephone via mobile application or text message; (ii) the remittance transfer provider complies with the foreign language requirements of § 1005.31(g)(2); and (iii) the provider discloses orally or via mobile application or text message a statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) pursuant to the timing requirements in § 1005.31(e)(1).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to the same authority, and for the same reasons as those discussed above regarding with § 1005.31(a)(3)(iv), the Bureau adopts new § 1005.31(a)(5)(iv), which adds as an additional condition for the provision of the pre-payment disclosures orally or via mobile application or text message a requirement that the provider disclose, to the extent applicable, (A) the information required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii) and (B) the information required by § 1005.36(d)(1)(i)(A) with respect to transfers subject to § 1005.36(d)(2)(ii), pursuant to the timing requirements in § 1005.31(e)(1).</analysisParagraph>

        <title>31(b)(2)(vii) Date of Transfer</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The February Final Rule requires the receipt provided to a sender to include an abbreviated statement about the sender's cancellation rights. § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv). In the February Proposal, the Bureau noted that senders may have difficulty determining the specific date on which the right to cancel expires for a particular transfer. 77 FR 6310, 6321. Accordingly, the Bureau sought comment on whether, as applicable, the three-business-day deadline to cancel transfers should be disclosed differently to consumers, such as by requiring a remittance transfer provider to disclose in the receipt the specific date on which the right to cancel will expire or to state its business days in receipts provided to senders. The Bureau also solicited comment on alternative means of disclosing the deadline for cancelling transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received a number of comments on the cancellation disclosure from various industry members and one consumer group. Most comments focused on whether providers should be required to include the specific cancellation deadline in the receipts provided to senders. Commenters did not address any of the other questions raised on this issue in the February Proposal nor did they suggest alternatives.<footnote ref="11">Regarding the Bureau's inquiry about disclosure of the provider's business days, the Bureau did not receive comment on this issue specifically, although one industry commenter stated that providers should not be required to disclose the specific deadline to cancel or other additional items that are not required to be disclosed by the February Final Rule.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to disclosure of the specific cancellation date, the majority of industry commenters opposed such a requirement. Some industry commenters asserted that requiring disclosure of the specific cancellation deadline for a particular transaction would make it more difficult and expensive to produce receipts by adding a new element specific to each transfer. One industry commenter stated that requiring a remittance transfer provider to specify the exact date for cancellation would create significant technical challenges because at that point, the disclosure becomes dynamic, rather than static. This commenter stated that producing such a dynamic disclosure may require updating based on the time of day of the transfer request and the provider's processing deadline, whereas a static disclosure without such a requirement can be reliably produced at any time of day. Further, the commenter stated that a sender uncertain of the cancellation deadline will contact a remittance transfer provider directly for clarification and then cancel the transaction in the course of the same contact.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In contrast, the consumer group commenter argued that the period for cancellation rights should be disclosed as a specific date. One industry commenter did not oppose requiring remittance transfer providers to disclose the specific cancellation date for each transaction, but argued that providers should be allowed to disclose a cut-off time for exercising the cancellation right because the lack of clarity regarding the time of day the cancellation period expires could result in a transfer being delayed until the next business day.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to the Bureau's authority under EFTA section 919(d)(3), the February Final Rule is revised to add a new § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii), which requires that a receipt for any remittance transfer scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, or the first transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, disclose the date the remittance transfer provider will make or made the remittance transfer, using the term “Transfer Date,” or a substantially similar term.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adopting commentary to provide further guidance on the application of § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii). As explained in more detail below in the discussion of § 1005.36, for certain transactions, a receipt meeting the requirements of § 1005.31(b)(2), including the transfer date required under § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii), may need to be provided at different times. For example, for the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, an initial receipt will need to be provided at the time payment is made for the transfer; and then in some cases, a receipt will need to be provided shortly after that particular transfer has been made. Thus, comment 31(b)(2)-4 clarifies that, where applicable, § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii) requires disclosure of the date of transfer for the remittance transfer that is the subject of a receipt required by § 1005.31(b)(2), including a receipt that is provided in accordance with the timing requirements in § 1005.36(a).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(2)-4 further clarifies that, for any subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer subject to § 1005.36(d)(2)(ii), the future date of transfer and related information must be provided on any receipt provided for the initial transfer in that series of preauthorized remittance transfers, or where permitted, or disclosed as permitted by § 1005.31(a)(3) and (a)(5), in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(1)(i).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(2)-5 provides an example of how disclosure of the dates of transfer required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii) and § 1005.36(d)(1) should be provided in receipts required by § 1005.31(b)(2) pursuant to the timing requirements in § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(1)(ii). Comment 31(b)(2)-5 also explains that if the provider discloses on either receipt the cancellation period applicable to and dates of subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers in accordance with 1005.36(d)(2)(i), the disclosure must be phrased and formatted in such a way that it is clear to the sender which cancellation period is applicable each date of transfer on the receipt.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Upon further review and analysis, the Bureau concludes that because the cancellation requirements in § 1005.36(c) are based on and calculated from the date of transfer, the actual transfer date is the most logical piece of information to require since the remittance transfer provider is already required to obtain this information in order to comply with § 1005.36(c), although it is not required to be disclosed to the sender under the February Final Rule.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Further, the Bureau also believes that requiring a remittance transfer provider to disclose the date of a remittance transfer, along with a disclosure that the sender's cancellation rights will expire three business days before the date of the transfer, provides a reasonable balance between consumer and industry interests. This approach significantly improves the information provided to senders because, under the February Final Rule, a provider is generally only required to disclose the cancellation policy, with a statement such as “you can cancel for a full refund no later than three business days prior to the scheduled date of the transfer.” 77 FR 6310, 6321. This required disclosure, however, does not elaborate on what constitutes the date of transfer or how the sender may determine the cancellation deadline from the date of transfer. Without a clear starting point from which to count the three-business-day deadline, the Bureau believes senders may be confused about the dates by which they are required to cancel transfers, which may make cancellation disclosures less effective. In situations such as when transferred funds will be drawn from an account at a later date rather than paid up front, the transfer date may also help the sender understand when the funds for the transfer must be available for the provider to conduct the transfer. The transfer date may also help senders differentiate and keep track of completed transfers, especially where the sender receives a number of receipts in the mail or on an account statement in close proximity to one another.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also believes that requiring disclosure of the date of transfer is the most technically feasible solution relative to the alternatives raised in the February Proposal. The dates of transfer should be readily available to remittance transfer providers since they are likely primarily responsible for executing remittance transfer requests, and as part of their business processes should already know when they must execute transfers to satisfy the terms of their contracts with senders (if the contracts are based on the date of the transfer) or to meet any delivery deadlines (if those deadlines are the bases of the contracts). The Bureau also believes that disclosure of the date of transfer is an added benefit for senders who may choose to schedule a transaction based on when the funds must be available. Finally, the Bureau notes that the requirement to disclose the date of transfer is consistent with the existing requirement for certain preauthorized electronic fund transfers. In particular, § 1005.10(d)(1) (in subpart A of Regulation E) requires an electronic fund transfer provider to send the consumer the date of transfer (and other information) at least ten days before the scheduled date of the transfer when a preauthorized electronic fund transfer from the consumer's account will vary in amount from the previous transfer under the same authorization. Consequently, certain remittance transfer providers that also provide preauthorized electronic fund transfers may already have the capability to produce disclosures with the date of transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Moreover, the Bureau believes that keeping disclosure forms short, simple, and succinct is helpful to senders. As noted in the February Final Rule, participants in consumer testing understood and responded positively to concise, abbreviated disclosures. 77 FR 6194, 6228. Of the options considered, the Bureau believes that disclosure of only the date of transfer best accomplishes this goal because that date may be provided independently of other information. While disclosure of the specific dates of cancellation deadlines would inform senders of the actual dates on which their rights to cancel expire, the Bureau believes that consumers would still benefit from disclosure of the date of transfer. The Bureau is concerned that requiring providers to include multiple dates on receipts may be more confusing to senders and possibly dilute the usefulness of the disclosures regarding cancellation rights.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Likewise, the Bureau is concerned that requiring providers to state their business days on receipts may result in a longer, more unwieldy form. The Bureau believes that providers will generally make available to the public upon request the days that constitute “business days” under subpart B of Regulation E, and that, therefore, senders can obtain this information as necessary. Absent further data regarding the usefulness of this information, the Bureau does not believe that it is appropriate at this time to make the forms significantly longer and more complicated to include information that is likely to be used by only a small subset of consumers who may contact their remittance transfer providers in any event to effectuate the cancellation.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, the Bureau believes that requiring the date of transfer and cancellation rights in receipts strikes the appropriate balance between providing senders with information about their transfers and minimizing the burden to providers. However, the Bureau will continue to gather data on consumers' exercise of cancellation rights, the effectiveness of related disclosures, and programming burdens on providers over time and, if warranted, will reexamine this issue at a later date to determine if a better solution exists.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has further determined that it is appropriate to require disclosure of the date of transfer at the time payment is made, but also in subsequent receipts required to be provided with respect to a given transfer in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) or § 1005.36(a)(2)(ii). The Bureau believes that a single consistent rule will be simpler as a matter of programming for providers and will frequently provide additional benefits to consumers in light of the fact that the final rule eliminates the requirement to provide the pre-payment disclosure and receipt in advance of the transfer for subsequent preauthorized transfers in a series. (<em data-original="E-03">See</em> discussion below regarding § 1005.36(a).)</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In particular, although stating the date of transfer in a post-transfer receipt will not facilitate senders' understanding of cancellation deadlines that have already passed, the Bureau believes the information will frequently be useful to senders in other ways. For example, as noted above, if a sender schedules a number of standalone transfers before the date of transfer, or a series of closely-spaced preauthorized remittance transfers, senders may receive a number of receipts in close proximity to each other and may use the date of transfer to identify and track which transfer has occurred. Having the date of transfer on receipts with respect to each transfer would likewise be helpful in situations where the receipt is provided with a periodic statement on which there are several transactions.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, because senders may not receive additional disclosures prior to the subsequent preauthorized transfer in a series, the receipt provided after the transfer is completed in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(2)(ii) will contain information regarding cancellation rights (as well as the exchange rate, fees and taxes) that could help inform the sender about the upcoming subsequent remittance transfer. Furthermore, as most preauthorized remittance transfers are likely to be scheduled some time in advance, senders will generally receive receipts after the transfer is completed. This receipt would provide confirmation that the transfer occurred as scheduled. Finally, where remittance transfer providers choose to satisfy their obligations under § 1005.36(d)(1) by disclosing the future transfer dates for preauthorized transfers on a receipt relating to a prior transaction, providing the date of transfer for the prior transaction will help differentiate to which transfer the disclosures in the receipt apply.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisSection>
          <title>Disclosure of Both the Three-Business-Day Deadline and the 30-Minute Deadline in Same Receipt</title>
          <analysisParagraph>Under § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) of the February Final Rule, notice of the period to cancel a remittance transfer must be disclosed in the receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(2). For any transfer scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, the receipt provided by the remittance transfer provider to the sender may describe only the cancellation rights and three-business-day deadline set forth in § 1005.36(c). For all other remittance transfers, the provider is required to describe the cancellation rights and 30-minute cancellation period set forth in § 1005.34(a). In the February Proposal, the Bureau solicited comment on whether remittance transfer providers that offer both types of transfers should be given flexibility to include the two different cancellation periods permitted by this rule on the same receipt with some statement or method such as a checkbox to designate which cancellation period applies to a given transaction.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received only a few comments on this issue. Of those received, two industry commenters urged the Bureau to permit providers flexibility in disclosing the cancellation requirement. One industry commenter argued that allowing providers to include both cancellation period options on the same receipt would enable providers to rely on one standard receipt form, which, compared to the alternative, may result in lower costs for providers (and, presumably, lower prices for senders). The other industry commenter stated that it supported any disclosure modification that would allow smaller providers to generate and deliver one disclosure and that the proposed option would eliminate the need to produce multiple disclosures to reflect the different cancellation periods. A consumer group commenter, however, stated that, to ensure that senders receive accurate and precise information to avoid potential confusion, only the cancellation provision that corresponds to the type of remittance transfer requested should be disclosed.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>After consideration of these comments, the Bureau is adding new comment 31(b)(2)-6 to clarify that providers that offer remittance transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, as well as remittance transfers scheduled fewer than three business days before the date of the transfer, may meet the cancellation disclosure requirements in § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) by describing the three-business-day and 30-minute cancellation periods on the same disclosure and using a checkbox or other method to clearly designate the applicable cancellation period. In other words, remittance transfer providers that provide both transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer and transfers scheduled closer to the date of the transfer may disclose the cancellation period applicable to a particular transfer in one of two ways: (i) describe in the receipt either the 30-minute cancellation period or the three-business-day cancellation period, as applicable to the particular transaction; or (ii) provide a description of both the 30-minute and three-business-day cancellation periods along with a clear indication of which cancellation period applies to the sender's transaction. With respect to the latter option, the comment does not mandate a particular method for identifying the applicable time period for cancellation. The comment, however, clarifies that the provider may use a number of ways to indicate which cancellation period applies to the transaction including, but not limited to, a statement to that effect, use of a checkbox, highlighting, circling, and the like. Finally, comment 31(b)(2)-6 states that for transfers scheduled three or more business days before the date of transfer, the cancellation disclosures provided pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) should be phrased and formatted in such a way that it is clear to the sender which cancellation period is applicable to the date of transfer disclosed on the receipt.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes senders are unlikely to be confused by having a description of both cancellation deadlines in the same disclosure. To the contrary, including a description of both the 30-minute and three-business-day cancellation period with a checkbox or other method that clearly designates the cancellation time period applicable to the sender's transaction may improve senders' understanding of the cancellation provisions generally. Moreover, the ability for remittance transfer providers to use pre-printed receipt forms that describe both cancellation options with some method to identify the applicable cancellation time period may reduce the need to create multiple standard receipts, potentially reducing costs for some providers. The Bureau also notes that nothing in the final rule prohibits a provider from including only the applicable cancellation policy on a receipt.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>31(b)(3) Combined Disclosure</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is revising the requirements in the February Final Rule for combined disclosures that remittance transfer providers may choose to give to senders. Under § 1005.31(b)(3) in the February Final Rule, a remittance transfer provider may combine the pre-payment disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(1) and the receipt required by § 1005.31(b)(2) into a single, combined disclosure, if such a disclosure is provided pursuant to the timing requirements applicable to pre-payment disclosures. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(e)(1). Section 1005.31(b)(3) provides that if the provider chooses to provide a combined disclosure, the provider must also provide the sender a proof of payment for the transfer when payment is made for the remittance transfer. As described in the February Final Rule, the Bureau issued § 1005.31(b)(3) pursuant to its authority under EFTA sections 919(a)(5)(C), and 904(a) and (c).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to the same authority, the Bureau is revising § 1005.31(b)(3) to allow a remittance transfer provider to provide a confirmation of scheduling in lieu of the proof of payment with combined disclosures for transfers scheduled before the date of transfer in order to facilitate compliance and enhance consumer protection. The Bureau is redesignating § 1005.31(b)(3) from the February Final Rule as § 1005.31(b)(3)(i) and is adopting a new § 1005.31(b)(3)(ii). Section 1005.31(b)(3)(ii) states that if the disclosure described in § 1005.31(b)(3)(i) is provided in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) (which concerns one-time transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer or the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers) and payment is not processed by the remittance transfer provider at the time the remittance transfer is scheduled, a remittance transfer provider may provide confirmation that the transaction has been scheduled in lieu of the proof of payment otherwise required by § 1005.31(b)(3)(i). The confirmation of scheduling must be clear and conspicuous, provided in writing or electronically, and provided in a retainable form.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Although the February Proposal did not propose changes to § 1005.31(b)(3), it sought comment generally on the form of disclosures for transfers scheduled before the date of transfer. 77 FR 6310, 6317. The Bureau believes that adjustments are necessary to § 1005.31(b)(3) because while comment 31(e)-2 in the final rule states that payment is made for purposes of subpart B of Regulation E when payment is authorized, this does not necessarily mean that providing “proof of payment” at the time of authorization will make sense for either the provider or the sender for a one-time remittance transfer that is scheduled before the date of transfer or the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers when payment may not be processed until closer to the date of such transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For many remittance transfers, senders tender payment for immediate processing once they authorize the remittance transfer provider to complete the transfer (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> by paying cash or by providing a payment device). In those situations, the Bureau does not believe there would be any downside for the sender or the remittance transfer provider if the provider provided proof of payment at the time that payment is made, <em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> authorized. These situations are distinct from the case in which a sender arranges with the provider to have funds deducted from the sender's account with the provider or to process a payment with a payment device at some later time, closer to the date of a transfer. In such an instance, the Bureau is concerned that providing a sender with “proof of payment” could confuse the sender. Furthermore, the Bureau is concerned that providers may not wish to provide “proof of payment” in such instances.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 31(b)(3)-2 provides additional guidance regarding the confirmation of scheduling. This comment explains that, as discussed in comment 31(e)-2, payment is considered to be made when payment is authorized for purposes of various timing requirements in subpart B, including with regard to the timing requirement for provision of the proof of payment described in § 1005.31(b)(3)(i). However, where a transfer (whether a one-time remittance transfer or the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers) is scheduled before the date of transfer and the provider does not intend to process payment until at or near the date of transfer, the provider may provide a confirmation of scheduling in lieu of the proof of payment required by § 1005.31(b)(3)(i). No further proof of payment is required when payment is later processed.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1005.31 Disclosures</title>
      <analysisParagraph>EFTA sections 919(a)(2)(A) and (B) require a remittance transfer provider to disclose, among other things, the amount to be received by the designated recipient in the currency in which it will be received.  In the 2012 Final Rule under § 1005.31, the Bureau set forth the disclosure requirements for providers, including that providers disclose fees and taxes imposed by a person other than the provider.  Pursuant to EFTA section 919(a)(4)(A), the Bureau adopted an exception in § 1005.32(a) to provide that for certain disclosures by insured depository institutions or credit unions regarding the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient will be deemed to be accurate in certain circumstances so long as the disclosure provides a reasonably accurate estimate of the amount of currency to be received. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As noted in the December Proposal, after the Bureau issued the February Final Rule, industry participants continued to express concerns previously raised in response to the Board's proposed rule to implement EFTA section 919.  The concerns regarded the feasibility of disclosing fees imposed by a designated recipient's institution. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For the subset of transfers sent over the open network, industry participants stated that where a designated recipient's institution charges that recipient fees for receiving a transfer into an account, the remittance transfer provider would not typically know whether the recipient had agreed to pay such fees or how much the recipient had agreed to pay.  Some industry participants also requested guidance on whether and how to disclose recipient institution fees that can vary based on the recipient's status with the institution, quantity of transfers received, or other variables that are not easily knowable by the sender or the provider.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Separately, after the release of the February 2012 Rule, industry expressed concern about the disclosure of foreign taxes.  Industry participants argued first that it is significantly more burdensome to research and disclose subnational taxes, <em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> taxes imposed by regional, provincial, state, and other local governments than it is to research and disclose those taxes imposed by a country's central government because there are substantially more jurisdictions that could impose these subnational taxes.  Second, industry participants suggested that the guidance in the 2012 Final Rule under comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-2, which would allow remittance transfer providers to rely on senders' representations regarding variables that affect the amount of taxes imposed by a person other than the provider is insufficient where variables that influence the amount of taxes imposed by a person other than the provider are not easily knowable by the sender or the provider. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>With respect to both recipient institution fees and foreign taxes, industry stated that, to make the appropriate calculations and disclosures, remittance transfer providers might need to ask numerous questions of senders that senders might not understand or might not be able to answer.  With respect to fees, industry also stated that the calculations required to determine and disclose fees might vary with respect to each recipient institution because each of these institutions might have unique fee schedules that applied to particular accounts or different ways of imposing fees on remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In response to these comments, in the December Proposal, the Bureau proposed to provide additional flexibility and guidance regarding the calculation and disclosure of fees imposed by a designated recipient's institution for receiving a transfer into an account and taxes imposed by a person other than the remittance transfer provider.  The Bureau also proposed to eliminate the requirement to disclose regional, provincial, state, and other local foreign taxes and to include this amount in the disclosed amount received by the designated recipient.  The Bureau sought comment on whether these proposed changes achieved the goals stated in the December Proposal, or whether the existing rules or another alternative were preferable. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The majority of comments on the proposed changes regarding recipient institution fee and tax disclosures came from industry participants, including large banks, community banks, credit unions, non-depository institutions, and trade associations.  These commenters stated that they appreciated the Bureau's attempts to facilitate compliance, particularly with respect to the proposal to eliminate the required disclosure of subnational taxes.  However, many industry commenters argued that the proposed changes did not go far enough to ease compliance burden.  These industry commenters asserted that the proposed flexibility would not effectively mitigate the difficulty of researching the information needed to provide the recipient institution fee and foreign tax disclosures to senders.  Further, these industry commenters also expressed concern that the proposed estimation methods could increase consumer confusion due to discrepancies in the estimated amounts disclosed.  Moreover, industry commenters expressed concern that, under the estimation methods described in the December Proposal, the sender would usually receive a disclosure that showed the highest possible fee or tax that could apply.  As a result of this proposed highest estimation method, commenters stated that the disclosure could result in senders increasing the amount of money transferred more than was necessary to insure that a recipient received the expected amount.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Some consumer groups also expressed skepticism about the proposed estimation methods for a different reason: they believed that any additional estimation, beyond that permitted in the 2012 Final Rule, would be detrimental to senders because they would not know the precise amount of the transfer that would be received.  In contrast, other consumer groups supported the December Proposal and stated that it struck the proper balance of facilitating compliance, while also providing meaningful information to senders. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has carefully weighed these concerns and, for the reasons explained in detail below, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to exercise its exception authority under EFTA section 904(c) to eliminate the requirement to include certain recipient institution fees and taxes collected by a person other than the remittance transfer provider in the calculation of the amount to be received by the designated recipient pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii).  For the same reasons, the Bureau is eliminating the requirement to disclose these amounts under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi).  However, as noted above, the Bureau believes that a majority of remittance transfers are sent through closed networks whereby the recipient picks up the transfer from an agent.  In these cases, all fees imposed on the remittance transfer would continue to be required to be disclosed. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.30(h)(1).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For those minority of transfers where there may be non-covered third-party fees, the 2013 Final Rule requires that remittance transfer providers include, as applicable, a disclaimer on the pre-payment disclosure and receipt, or combined disclosure, indicating that the recipient may receive less due to fees charged by the recipient's bank. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii).  Similarly, if there may be taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, the 2013 Final Rule requires that providers include a disclaimer indicating that the recipient may receive less due to foreign taxes.  As part of these disclaimers, providers may choose to disclose an exact or estimated amount of these fees or taxes. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.32(b)(3).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As described in detail below, the 2013 Final Rule's Appendix and Model Forms have been amended to include samples of the new disclosures and disclaimers.  The Bureau is also making conforming edits in several other provisions in § 1005.31 to reflect the changes in the required disclosures.  These changes are described below. </analysisParagraph>

As discussed in more detail below, many commenters requested clarification on specific definitions, and also urged the Bureau to consider a number of revisions and exemptions to limit the application of the rule to different types of transactions. Final § 1005.30 incorporates the statutory definitions generally as proposed, with additional interpretations and clarifications in response to specific concerns raised by commenters. The final rule revises the definition of “business day” in § 1005.30(b) to more closely track the definition of “business day” in § 1005.2(d) of Regulation E.

      <analysisParagraph>As amended, comment 30(c)-2.ii explains that for transfers to a prepaid account (other than a prepaid account that is a payroll card account or a government benefit account), where the funds are to be received in a location physically outside of any State depends on whether the provider at the time the transfer is requested has information indicating that funds are to be received in a foreign country. In addition, for transfers to all other accounts, whether funds are to be received at a location physically outside of any State depends on where the account is located. If the account is located in a State, the funds will not be received at a location in a foreign country. Further, for these accounts, if they are located on a U.S. military installation that is physically located in a foreign country, then they are located in a State.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Further, comment 30(g)-1, as amended, explains that for transfers sent from a prepaid account (other than a prepaid account that is a payroll card account or a government benefit account), whether the consumer is located in a State depends on the location of the consumer. If the provider does not know where the consumer is at the time the consumer requests the transfer from the consumer's prepaid account (other than a prepaid account that is a payroll card account or a government benefit account), the provider may make the determination of whether a consumer is located in a State based on information that is provided by the consumer and on any records associated with the consumer that the provider may have, such as an address provided by the consumer. For transfers from all other accounts belonging to a consumer, whether a consumer is located in a State depends on where the consumer's account is located. Additionally, for these accounts, if they are located on a U.S. military installation that is physically located in a foreign country, then they are located in a State.</analysisParagraph>

The Bureau proposed renumbering the regulatory citation for <em data-original="E-03">bona fide</em> trust account, changing it from § 1005.2(b)(3) to § 1005.2(b)(2), because the Bureau proposed to set forth the definition of prepaid account in new § 1005.2(b)(3). The Bureau also proposed minor changes to comment 30(g)-3 to streamline the text of the comment without altering its meaning.

      <title>Section 1005.33 Procedures for Resolving Errors</title>
      <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(d) addresses procedures for resolving errors in connection with remittance transfers, and allows a sender to provide notice of an error within 180 days of the promised date of delivery of a remittance transfer. The sender's notice triggers a remittance transfer provider's duty to investigate the claim and correct any error within 90 days of receiving the notice. The statue generally does not define what types of transfers and inquiries constitute errors and gives the Bureau the authority to define “error.” The Board proposed § 205.33 to implement the new error resolution requirements for remittance transfers that adapted many of the same error resolution procedures that currently apply to a financial institution under § 1005.11. The Bureau adopts proposed § 205.33 as § 1005.33 with several changes based on recommendations from commenters, as discussed in detail below.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1005.33 Procedures for Resolving Errors</title>
      <analysisParagraph>As noted above, consumers may be permitted to schedule a series of preauthorized remittance transfers in which the transfer amount is fixed in a currency other than that in which the transfer is funded. Thus, § 1005.32(b)(2)(i) permits estimates to be provided for, among other things, the total amount of the transfer. In light of this new provision, a revision to § 1005.33(a)(1)(i) is necessary to clarify that disclosing an estimate of the total amount of the transfer in this case would not result in an error.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Under the February Final Rule, § 1005.33(a)(1)(i) states than “error” means an incorrect amount paid by a sender in connection with a remittance transfer. Comment 33(a)-1 explains that § 1005.33(a)(1)(i) covers circumstances in which a sender pays an amount that differs from the total amount of the transaction, including fees imposed in connection with the transfer, stated in the receipt or combined disclosure provided under § 1005.31(b)(2) or (3).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is revising this provision to exempt from the definition of error estimates of the total amount of the transfer provided in accordance with the new exception in § 1005.32(b)(2). This exception allows for, among other things, an estimate of the amount to be transferred if, at the time the sender schedules the transfer, the remittance transfer provider agrees to a sender's request to fix the amount to be transferred in the currency in which the remittance transfer will be received and not the currency in which it is funded. When the amount to be transferred is estimated under this section, the provider is also permitted to estimate the total amount of the transaction (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the amount to be paid by the sender).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Thus, as revised, § 1005.33(a)(1)(i) states that the term error means an incorrect amount paid by a sender in connection with a remittance transfer, unless the disclosure stated an estimate of the amount paid by a sender in accordance with § 1005.32(b)(2) and the difference results from application of the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes, rather than any estimated amount. As discussed in detail below, when a remittance transfer provider estimates of the total amount of the transfer in a receipt provided at least five or more business days before the date of transfer (<em data-original="E-03">see</em> § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) and (a)(2)(i)), the provider must also send a receipt without the estimate after the transfer (<em data-original="E-03">see</em> § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) and (a)(2)(ii)). Thus, the sender will still receive a receipt with the actual amount the sender paid for the transfer and can still assert an error based on the disclosure of the amount paid in that receipt.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1005.33 Procedures for Resolving Errors</title>
      <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(d) provides that remittance transfer providers shall investigate and resolve errors where a sender provides a notice of an error within 180 days of the promised date of delivery of a remittance transfer.  The statute generally does not define what types of transfers and inquiries constitute errors, but rather gives the Bureau broad authority to set standards for remittance transfer providers with respect to error resolution relating to remittance transfers.  The 2012 Final Rule implements such error resolution standards in § 1005.33. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Under § 1005.33, as adopted in the 2012 Final Rule, an error occurs in various situations including when the remittance transfer is not made available to a designated recipient by the date of availability stated in the disclosure provided by § 1005.31(b)(2) or (3) for the remittance transfer.  Such an error may result from a sender's provision of an incorrect account or routing number to a remittance transfer provider.  Industry expressed concern after the February Final Rule was published about the remedies available when a sender provides an incorrect account number to the provider.  Providers have stated that in some cases, as a result of such errors, remittance transfers may be deposited into the wrong account and, despite reasonable efforts by the provider, cannot be recovered.  Under § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii) of the 2012 Final Rule, a provider is obligated to resend to the designated recipient or refund to the sender the total amount of the remittance transfer regardless of whether it can recover the funds.  Industry has noted that this problem is of particular concern with respect to transfers of large sums, particularly for smaller institutions that might have more difficulty bearing the loss of the entire transfer amount.  In addition, providers have expressed concern that the remedy provisions of the 2012 Final Rule create a potential for fraud, despite an exception that excludes transfers with fraudulent intent from the definition of error. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C). </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In response to these concerns, in the December Proposal the Bureau proposed a new exception to the definition of error in § 1005.33.  The exception set forth in proposed § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) would have excluded from the definition of error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) the sender having given the remittance transfer provider an incorrect account number, provided the provider met certain specified conditions.  The Bureau also proposed several other changes to the error resolution procedures in § 1005.33 to address questions of how remittance transfer providers should provide remedies to senders for errors that occurred because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Based on comments received, the Bureau is adopting the proposed exception and is further revising these procedures as detailed below.  The Bureau is also adopting conforming changes to the error resolution procedures to reflect revisions to the disclosure requirements concerning non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the provider as well as making several technical, non-substantive changes.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1005.32 Estimates</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The statute provides two exceptions to the requirement to disclose the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient. The first exception is in EFTA section 919(a)(4). It provides that, subject to rules prescribed by the Bureau, disclosures by insured depository institutions or credit unions regarding the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient will be deemed to be accurate in certain circumstances so long as the disclosure provides a reasonably accurate estimate of the amount of currency to be received. Under the statute, a remittance transfer provider may use this exception only if: (i) It is an insured depository institution or insured credit union (collectively, an “insured institution” as described in more detail below) conducting a transfer from an account that the sender holds with it; and (ii) the insured institution is unable to know, for reasons beyond its control, the amount of currency that will be made available to the designated recipient. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> EFTA section 919(a)(4). This exception (the “temporary exception”) expires five years after the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, on July 21, 2015. If the Bureau determines that expiration of the exception would negatively affect the ability of insured institutions to send remittances to foreign countries, the Bureau may extend the exception to not longer than ten years after enactment (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> to July 21, 2020). <em data-original="E-03">See</em> EFTA section 919(a)(4)(B).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The second exception is in EFTA section 919(c). It provides that if the Bureau determines that a recipient country does not legally allow, or the method by which transactions are made in the recipient country do not allow, a remittance transfer provider to know the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient, the Bureau may prescribe rules addressing the issue. EFTA section 919(c) further states that if rules are prescribed, they must include standards for the remittance transfer provider to provide: (i) A receipt that is consistent with EFTA sections 919(a) and (b); and (ii) a reasonably accurate estimate of the currency to be received. The second exception (the “permanent exception”) does not have a sunset date.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed § 205.32 to implement the two exceptions in EFTA sections 919(a)(4) and (c). Proposed § 205.32 generally permitted a remittance transfer provider to disclose estimates if it cannot determine exact amounts for the reasons specified in the statute. The Bureau is adopting § 205.32 generally as proposed in renumbered § 1005.32, with clarifications and revisions in response to comments received, as discussed in detail below. In addition, the Bureau is adopting new comment 32-1 to provide additional guidance on the circumstances when estimates may be provided. Specifically, new comment 32-1 states that estimates as permitted in § 1005.32(a) and (b) may be used in the pre-payment disclosure described in § 1005.31(b)(1), the receipt disclosure described in § 1005.31(b)(2), the combined disclosure described in § 1005.31(b)(3), and the pre-payment disclosures and receipt disclosures for both first and subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers described in § 1005.36(a)(1) and (2).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1005.32 Estimates</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Consistent with EFTA section 919, the 2012 Final Rule generally requires that disclosures provided to senders state the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes that will apply to a remittance transfer and the actual amount that will be received by the designated recipient of a remittance transfer.  Section 1005.32, as adopted in the 2012 Final Rule, includes only three specific exceptions to this requirement.  First, consistent with EFTA section 919(a)(4), § 1005.32(a) of the 2012 Final Rule provides a temporary exception for certain transfers by insured institutions.  Second, consistent with EFTA section 919(c), § 1005.32(b)(1) provides a permanent exception for transfers to certain countries.  Third, the 2012 Final Rule also includes an exception under § 1005.32(b)(2) for transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of the transfer.  Thus, a remittance transfer provider is permitted to estimate exchange rates, fees, and taxes that are required by § 1005.31 to be disclosed to the extent permitted in § 1005.32(a) and (b).  The December Proposal would have created additional exceptions to permit estimation with respect to certain recipient institution fees under proposed § 1005.32(b)(4) and national foreign taxes under proposed § 1005.32(b)(3).  The proposed related commentary would have described the particular methods that could be used to estimate under these two methods.  As discussed above, under § 1005.31(d), in both cases, the provider would have been required to disclose that the amount was estimated pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) and (vii). </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Given that the 2013 Final Rule does not require the disclosure of non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected by a person other than the remittance transfer provider (see § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi)), the two proposed estimation methods are now unnecessary.  As a result, the proposed changes to the 2012 Final Rule under § 1005.32(b)(3) and (4) are not being adopted nor is the Bureau adopting the related proposed changes to the commentary. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> proposed comments 32(b)(3) and (4). </analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, EFTA section 919(a)(4)(A) establishes a temporary exception for insured institutions with respect to the statute's general requirement that remittance transfer providers must disclose exact amounts to senders. EFTA 919(a)(4)(B) provides that the exception shall terminate five years after the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> July 21, 2015), unless the Bureau issues a rule to extend the temporary exception up to five more years (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> July 21, 2020).

EFTA section 919(a)(4)(B). The Bureau implemented the temporary exception by adopting § 1005.32(a) in the Remittance Rule.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.32(a)(1) provides that a remittance transfer provider may give estimates for disclosures related to: (1) The exchange rate used by the provider; (2) the total amount that will be transferred to the designated recipient inclusive of covered third-party fees, if any; (3) any covered third-party fees and (4) the amount that will be received by the designated recipient (after deducting covered third-party fees), if the provider meets three conditions. The three conditions are: (1) The provider must be an insured institution; (2) the provider must not be able to determine the exact amounts for reasons beyond its control; and (3) the transfer must be sent from the sender's account with the provider. Section 1005.32(a)(2) provides that the temporary exception expires on July 21, 2015. Section 1005.32(a)(3) provides that insured depository institutions, insured credit unions, and uninsured U.S. branches and agencies of foreign depository institutions are considered “insured institutions” for purposes of the temporary exception.<footnote ref="21">The Bureau understands that broker-dealers may also rely on the temporary exception because a SEC no-action letter concluded that the SEC staff would not recommend enforcement action to the SEC under Regulation E if a broker-dealer provides disclosures as if the broker-dealer were an insured institution for purposes of the temporary exception.

      <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau proposed to amend § 1005.32(a)(2) to extend the expiration date of the temporary exception from July 21, 2015, to July 21, 2020, after it had reached a preliminary determination that the expiration of the temporary exception on July 21, 2015, would negatively impact the ability of insured institutions to send remittance transfers. The determination was based on the Bureau's own understanding of the remittance transfer market, information the Bureau gathered through approximately 35 interviews with remittance transfer providers, service providers, and consumer groups regarding the temporary exception, outreach to industry and consumers groups on the Remittance Rule generally, and a review of comment letters to prior remittance rulemakings and related materials. In the April Proposal, the Bureau sought comments on its preliminary determination that the expiration of the temporary exception on July 21, 2015, would have a negative impact on the ability of insured institutions to send remittance transfers. The Bureau also sought comments on whether it should extend the exception for a period less than the full five years permitted by statute or place other limits on the use of the temporary exception.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau additionally solicited comments on the current consumer impact of the temporary exception, as well as the potential consumer impact of either the expiration or the extension of the exception. For the reasons stated below, the Bureau has reached a final determination that the expiration of the temporary exception on July 21, 2015, would negatively affect the ability of insured institutions to send remittance transfers, and is therefore adopting the change to § 1005.32(a)(2) as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters overwhelmingly supported the proposed extension of the temporary exception from July 21, 2015, to July 21, 2020. They generally agreed with the Bureau's description of the remittance transfer market and preliminary determination that the expiration of the temporary exception would have a negative impact on the ability of insured institutions to send remittance transfers, emphasizing that the expiration of the temporary exception on July 21, 2015, would cause some insured institutions to either exit the market or significantly reduce the number of destinations to which they send remittances.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, comments from industry commenters were generally consistent with the Bureau's understanding of how insured institutions are complying with the Remittance Rule's requirements regarding disclosures of the applicable exchange rate and covered third party fees, including the compliance practices of small institutions. Some commenters, ranging from credit unions to a large bank, stated that they rely on larger service providers to help disclose covered third-party fees and exchange rates. Industry commenters also were largely in accord with the Bureau's understanding of the drawbacks to wire transfer alternatives such as international ACH and closed-network remittance transfer products that resemble products offered by money transmitters. Several trade association commenters asserted that even with the expansion of international ACH products and the development of new closed network systems, such expansion will provide a solution only for remittance transfers to a limited set of destination countries and that providers would have difficulty sending remittance transfers to some destinations without reliance on the temporary exception. This is consistent with the Bureau's understanding of current market conditions based on its interviews with many providers and service providers in the course of developing the April Proposal.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>A number of bank and credit union commenters stated that they rely on the temporary exception, and trade association commenters stated that many of their members rely on the temporary exception for at least some portion of the remittance transfers sent by their customers and members. Several trade association commenters asserted that the ability of insured institutions to rely on the temporary exception is critical for certain remittance transfers and emphasized that there are real limitations that exist in open network payment systems that currently prevent insured institutions from being able to disclose actual amounts in all cases. A number of community bank and credit union commenters, as well as the trade associations that represent them, stated that the expiration of the temporary exception could cause many community banks to either exit the remittance transfer market or significantly cut back the scope of their services.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters, including a correspondent bank and several trade associations, expressed concern that, even if the Bureau extended the temporary exception by five years, insured institutions would not be able to develop a comprehensive solution that would allow them to disclose exact covered third-party fees and exchange rates for every corridor they currently serve by July 2020. Several industry commenters also asserted that the Bureau should work with Congress to change the temporary exception into a permanent one, and one commenter suggested that the Bureau should make the temporary exception permanent without waiting for Congress to act.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau sought comments on the current consumer impact of the temporary exception, as well as the potential impact of either the expiration or the extension of the exception. One State credit union trade association stated that its member credit unions indicated that they have not received any complaints from members who received disclosures containing estimated disclosures. A number of community bank and credit union commenters, as well as the trade associations that represent them, stated that the expiration of the temporary exception could cause many community banks to either exit the remittance transfer market or significantly cut back the scope of their services. They asserted that such a reduction would negatively impact consumers, because it would reduce the availability of remittance transfer services. They also expressed the concern that such a reduction could limit competition and drive up prices.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The two consumer group commenters opposed this part of the April Proposal. One of the consumer group commenters asserted that, rather than extend the exception for the maximum of five years permitted by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Bureau should limit the extension of the temporary exception. Specifically, this commenter suggested that the Bureau should: (1) Only extend the temporary exception for up to two years and reassess a further extension then; (2) limit the use of the exception to remittance transfers for which disclosing exact amounts is particularly difficult or impossible; or (3) reissue the proposal for additional comment and provide more specific information on the current state of compliance. The other consumer group commenter asserted that if the Bureau were to extend the temporary exception, then it should also require insured institutions that rely on the temporary exception to disclose to customers that money transmitters would be able to provide consumers with exact disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has considered the comments and, for the reasons discussed below, is finalizing as proposed the extension of the temporary exception to July 21, 2020, because the Bureau has made the determination that the expiration of the temporary exception would negatively affect the ability of insured institutions to send remittance transfers. Comments from industry commenters generally confirmed the Bureau's original understanding of the remittance transfer market and preliminary determination that the expiration of the temporary exception would have a negative impact on the ability of insured institutions to send remittance transfers.<footnote ref="22">The Bureau provided a detailed discussion of the reasons that lead to it making the preliminary determination that the termination of the temporary exception on July 21, 2015, would have a negative impact on the ability of insured institutions to send remittance transfers. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See generally&lt;/em&gt; 79 FR 23234 (April 25, 2014).</footnote>
           In particular, the Bureau understands that insured institutions typically send remittances in the form of wire transfers over open networks. With respect to a wire transfer, the insured institution that acts as the remittance transfer provider typically does not have control over, or a relationship with, all of the participants involved in a remittance transfer, to facilitate the provider's ability to control or obtain information about the applicable exchange rate and covered third-party fees with exactitude. Additionally, the communication systems used to send wire transfers typically do not facilitate two-way, real-time transmission of such information. While the Bureau understands that industry is working to restructure relationships and communication systems to provide more precise pricing information, this process is not yet complete.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>While some insured institutions provide exact disclosures of the exchange rate and covered third-party fees for all of their remittance transfers, the Bureau understands that many rely on the temporary exception when disclosing the exchange rate and/or covered third-party fees for at least some portion of transfers initiated by their own consumer customers and as applicable, transfers they send on behalf of other providers. The Bureau also understands that many insured institutions, in particular small institutions, rely almost entirely on larger, intermediary service providers to act as information aggregators to provide them with the applicable exchange rate to disclose and/or covered third-party fee information.<footnote ref="23">In the April Proposal, the Bureau stated that a particular institution may use one information aggregator to provide it with the covered third-party fee information, and another to provide it with the exchange rate information. 79 FR 23245 (Apr. 25, 2014). The Bureau also stated that it found that an insured institution that uses an information aggregator must generally also use that aggregator to help process the remittance transfer. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
        </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>With respect to the disclosure of the exchange rate, insured institutions have reported to the Bureau that they have found that one way to provide an exact exchange rate is to convert the funds to the applicable foreign currency based on a fixed exchange rate that the provider either obtains directly or from an information aggregator. However, the Bureau has learned that insured institutions cannot provide a fixed exchange rate for a number of currencies and rely on the temporary exception (or the Bureau's permanent exception for transfers to certain countries, § 1005.32(b)(2)) when disclosing the applicable exchange rate in such situations. The Bureau understands that these currencies are either (1) so thinly traded that insured institutions or their service providers find that purchasing such currencies and obtaining a fixed exchange rate for consumer wire transfers is impossible, impracticable, or economically undesirable, or (2) impracticable to purchase for other reasons (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> foreign laws may bar the purchase of that currency in the United States). Further, even if obtaining and disclosing a fixed exchange rate were possible, the Bureau further understands that typically, the volume of remittance transfers involving such currencies is often low and providers believe that it is impracticable to expend significant resources to provide a fixed rate for these low-volume transactions.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>With respect to covered third-party fees, the Bureau understands that information aggregators, described above, could directly generate the information from foreign banks in their correspondent banking networks or with whom they have other contractual relationships. Additionally, the Bureau understands that for a number of foreign destinations, these entities try to control the amount of covered third-party fees, or eliminate such fees altogether, by sending remittance transfers through nostro accounts they have established with various foreign banks,<footnote ref="24">Nostro accounts are accounts established by U.S. institutions with foreign banks, and funds in the accounts are funds in the account are typically denominated in the currency of that country. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 79 FR at 23245 (Apr. 25, 2014).</footnote>
           using certain methods to send wire transfers that put participants processing the wire transfer on notice not to deduct a fee from the transfer amount, or through a combination of both.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The information aggregators have reported to the Bureau that as a result of proactively obtaining covered third-party fee information from foreign banks and using methods that control or eliminate such fees, they and, as applicable, their remittance transfer provider clients are typically disclosing exact covered third-party fees where they believe they are able to do so, even though they might have additional flexibility pursuant to the temporary exception to provide estimates instead. But at the same time, information aggregators have reported that the methods that allow insured institutions to control or eliminate covered third-party fees are not reliable in controlling or eliminating such fees for all of the destinations to which they send wire transfers. Additionally, with respect to obtaining covered third-party fees directly from foreign banks, a number of information aggregators have indicated that fee information gathered in this manner could be incomplete because it is not available for all institutions involved in all of the remittance transfers they send. Accordingly, a number of insured institutions have to rely on the temporary exception when sending at least some of their wire transfers.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also sought information from insured institutions about their use of potential alternative methods of sending remittance transfers. In particular, the Bureau sought to understand whether insured institutions could control or eliminate covered third-party fees if they sent remittance transfers using international ACH instead of open network wire transfer systems. The Bureau understands that the Federal Reserve's international ACH product—FedGlobal ACH—generally restricts the deduction of fees from transfer amounts sent through the FedGlobal system, but is nonetheless used only for a small portion of insured institutions' remittance transfers. The Bureau has found that although a number of insured institutions use international ACH for commercial international money transfers, many did not see international ACH developing into an alternative to wire transfers in the near term. A number of insured institutions have reported that international ACH reaches far fewer destinations than wire transfers. They also expressed concern that developing an international ACH service for remittance transfers would involve costs and changes in operation systems that outweigh the potential long-term cost savings as well as any additional value of facilitating compliance with the Remittance Rule.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also sought information from insured institutions about developing closed network remittance transfer products that resemble products offered by money transmitters that could allow them to control or eliminate covered third-party fees. The Bureau also understands that a small number of the largest institutions have already developed such products. However, most of the insured institutions that the Bureau interviewed did not set up closed network alternatives to wire transfers and indicated that they did not have plans to develop them. As discussed above, several trade association commenters believed that the expansion of international ACH products and the development of new closed network systems will not provide a comprehensive solution.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For the above reasons and those stated more fully in the April Proposal, the Bureau also believes that it is unlikely that there would be near-term solutions that would address the challenges in open-network payment systems that prevent insured institutions from being able to disclose exact amounts for all of the foreign destinations to which they send remittance transfers. Accordingly, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to extend the length of the temporary exception for the full five years permitted by statute, rather than a shorter length of time (or not at all). The Bureau continues to believe that insured institutions will not be able to make the significant progress necessary for all institutions and corridors to warrant terminating the exception before July 2020, and does not believe that reassessing the situation after seeking additional public comment now or in two years would cause it to reach a different conclusion. At the same time, however, the Bureau believes that making the exception permanent in this rulemaking would be beyond its scope, which, pursuant to EFTA section 919(a)(4)(B), focused (on this issue) on whether the Bureau should extend the temporary exception by five additional years. Nevertheless, the Bureau will continue to monitor market and technological developments in open network payment systems. The Bureau expects insured institutions to continue to work towards providing actual disclosures for all remittance transfers by July 2020. The Bureau also notes that through its supervision of insured institutions it will continue to monitor the use of the exception, whether it is being abused, and whether and how providers are working towards finding a permanent solution for all remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also believes that it is appropriate to extend the temporary exception without modifications or additional requirements. As noted above, the Bureau continues to believe that insured institutions are unable to make the significant progress necessary for the Bureau to cause the temporary exception to terminate before July 2020. Furthermore, the Bureau is not aware of evidence that insured institutions are improperly using the temporary exception or that consumers are being harmed by its use in particular or, more generally, by the receipt of disclosures containing estimates. The Bureau understands that although use of the temporary exception varies, the exception appears to be used for the minority of eligible transfers from insured institutions. The FFIEC Call Report asked banks to estimate the number of remittance transfers sent between October 28 and December 31, 2013, to which they applied the temporary exception. The FFIEC Call Report data suggest that the temporary exception is only used in approximately 10 percent of transfers sent by banks that are considered remittance transfer providers under the rule. Additionally, no data was submitted to the Bureau in response to the request in the April Proposal, and the Bureau is aware of no data, that contradicts its view that use of the temporary exception is limited to cases where providers (and their service providers) deem its use to be necessary.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Lastly, the Bureau believes that it would be inappropriate to require insured institutions that disclose estimates pursuant to the temporary exception to inform their customers that money transmitters may provide consumers with exact disclosures. The Bureau notes that Congress expressly permitted any remittance transfer provider to disclose estimates in lieu of exact amounts in certain cases without any additional disclosure. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.32(b)(1) (permanent exception for transfers to certain countries) and (b)(2) (advance transfers) without any additional disclosure. Insofar as money transmitters rely on these exceptions set forth in the Remittance rule, it cannot be said that they are disclosing exact amounts in those cases.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii)(C) would have required disclosure of the telephone number, mailing address, and Web site of the person or office that a consumer may contact to learn about the terms and conditions of the prepaid account, to obtain prepaid account balance information, to request a written copy of transaction history pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii) if the financial institution does not provide periodic statements pursuant to existing § 1005.9(b), or to notify the person or office when a consumer believes that an unauthorized EFT has occurred as required by existing § 1005.7(b)(2) and proposed § 1005.18(d)(1)(ii).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>33(h) Incorrect Account Number Provided by the Sender </title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.33(h) contained several conditions that a remittance transfer provider would have been required to satisfy in order to benefit from the proposed exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D).  Specifically, proposed § 1005.33(h)(1) through (4) would have provided four conditions, including:  That the provider be able to demonstrate that the sender did in fact provide an incorrect account number, that the provider gave the sender notice that if the sender provided an incorrect account number that the transfer could be lost, that the incorrect account number resulted a deposit of the transfer into the wrong account, and that the provider used reasonable efforts to attempt to retrieve the mis-deposited funds. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In response to proposed § 1005.33(h), many industry commenters sought more specificity in the conditions, especially with respect to the form of notice required to inform senders that the transfer amount could be lost, what would satisfy as a reasonable effort to retrieve lost funds, and the timeframe in which such efforts would be deemed prompt.  Other industry participants, however, supported the generality in the proposed conditions because the commenters believed that the conditions provided flexibility and accommodated existing practice.  In addition, some industry commenters expressed concern with the proposed condition that funds actually be mis-deposited into the wrong account for the proposed exception to apply.  These commenters argued that often it is difficult for remittance transfer providers to know whether funds have in fact been mis-deposited.  The Bureau has considered these comments and is finalizing the rule with five conditions in § 1005.33(h)(1) through (5), each of which is discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Generally speaking, the Bureau believes that the conditions set forth in § 1005.33(h) are consistent with industry best practices today and will provide further incentive to continue improving safeguards against mis-deposit over time.  Where a remittance transfer is deposited into the wrong account today, the Bureau believes that many, if not most, providers already attempt to recover the principal amount of the transfer.  However, because providers have reported that they often do not have direct relationships with receiving institutions, and that in some instances those institutions may be unresponsive to requests for assistance, providers may face difficulties in recovering funds from the wrong account.  The Bureau believes that, in many instances, to reverse these transactions requires the accountholder to authorize a debit from the account and, thus, the lack of this authority may prohibit a recipient institution from debiting the account in the amount of the incorrect deposit absent an authorization.  Relatedly, a provider in the United States may be able to do little to assist the foreign institution in its attempt to persuade its accountholder to provide debit authorization due to the lack of privity between the provider and the recipient institution or the accountholder.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Thus, the 2013 Final Rule strikes an appropriate balance by limiting the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to circumstances of actual mis-deposits and by requiring reasonable verification methods, without holding remittance transfer providers responsible for circumstances beyond their control.

      <title>18(b)(7)(i)(C) Multiple Service Plan Disclosure</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed in § 1005.18(b)(4)(i)(C) that when a financial institution provides disclosures in compliance with proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) and discloses the fee schedules of multiple service plans together on one form, the fees that would have been required to be listed pursuant proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) through (<em data-original="E-03">7</em>) that vary among service plans must be generally grouped together, and the fees that are the same across all service plans must be grouped together. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> proposed Model Form A-10(f). Proposed § 1005.18(b)(4)(i)(C) would have further stated that if the periodic fee varies between service plans, the financial institution must use the term “plan fee,” or a substantially similar term when disclosing the periodic fee for each service plan. The Bureau believed that, when a financial institution chooses to disclose multiple service plans together on one short form, it would be most useful for a consumer to see all the fees that vary among plans grouped together to more easily compare the different plans. The Bureau sought comment on whether this grouping distinction for short forms that include multiple service plans makes sense.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(b)(4)(i)(C) also would have stated that when providing disclosures for multiple service plans on one short form in compliance with proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>), the incidence-based fees disclosed pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">8</em>) must be grouped with the fees that are the same across all service plans. The Bureau believed that since a financial institution would have to consider total incidence across all plans when determining its incidence-based fee disclosure to comply with proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">8</em>), it made sense that these fees would be grouped with the fees that are the same across all service plans.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received comments from industry and consumer groups regarding the multiple service plan short form generally, which are addressed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B) above. Most relevant to this provision were the comments from several consumer groups that urged the Bureau to eliminate the multiple service plan short form disclosure. The Bureau did not receive any comments, however, specific to proposed § 1005.18(b)(4)(i)(C).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.18(b)(4)(i)(C), renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(7)(i)(C), with substantial modifications to reflect the redesigned short form for multiple service plans as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B) above.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The final rule's grouping requirements correspond to the formatting requirements for the redesigned short form disclosure for multiple service plans set forth in final § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>). Similar to the grouping requirements in the short form and long form disclosures, the final rule's grouping requirements for short form disclosures for multiple service plans conform to the principle of grouping fees together and grouping other information together. Specifically, final § 1005.18(b)(7)(i)(C) requires that when providing a short form disclosure for multiple service plans pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), in lieu of the requirements in final § 1005.18(b)(7)(i)(A) for grouping of the disclosures required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (iv) and (v) through (ix), the information required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (ix) be grouped together and provided in that order. Model Form A-10(e) illustrates the grouping requirements specifically for short form disclosures with multiple service plans disclosed pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>).</analysisParagraph>

        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed in § 1005.18(b)(4)(i)(B) that all fees that may be imposed by the financial institution in connection with a prepaid account that proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii)(A) would have required to be disclosed in the long form must be generally grouped together and organized by categories of function for which a consumer would utilize the service associated with each fee. The Bureau believed that disclosing fees in categories would aid consumers' navigation of the long form disclosure, which would include all of a prepaid account's fees and could be much longer than the short form disclosure. Proposed § 1005.18(b)(4)(i)(B) would also have required that text describing the conditions under which a fee may be imposed must appear in the table directly to the right of the numeric fee amount disclosed pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii)(A). The information required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii)(B) (that is, the Regulation Z disclosures regarding overdraft and other credit features) must be generally grouped together. The information required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii)(C) through (E) (that is, the telephone number, Web site and mailing address; the statement regarding FDIC insurance, if applicable; and the Bureau Web site and telephone number), must be generally grouped together.</analysisParagraph>

      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.18(b)(4)(i)(B), renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(7)(i)(B), with modifications to reflect additional content added by other provisions of the final rule. The Bureau has also made technical modifications to the rule for conformity and clarity. Finally, the Bureau has added new comments 18(b)(7)(i)(B)-1 and-2 to provide guidance regarding the requirements of final § 1005.18(b)(7)(i)(B).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>First, the final rule addresses the grouping requirement for new § 1005.18(b)(4)(i), the title or heading for the long form disclosure. The final rule provides that the information required by new § 1005.18(b)(4)(i) be located in the first line of the long form disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The final rule, like the proposed rule, generally requires that like categories be grouped together in the long form disclosure. Regarding the disclosure in the long form of all fees and the conditions under which they may be imposed, the final rule, like the proposed rule, requires that the information required by final § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) be generally grouped together and organized under subheadings by the category of function for which a financial institution may impose the fee.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>While the proposed rule would have required that text describing the conditions under which a fee may be imposed must appear in the table directly to the right of the numeric fee amount disclosed, the final rule relaxes this requirement. In the final rule, the text describing the conditions under which a fee may be imposed must appear in the table required by final § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(A) in close proximity to the fee amount. The Bureau continues to believe that disclosing fees in categories will aid consumers in navigating the long form disclosure which, with the disclosure of all of a prepaid account's fees, could be much longer than the short form disclosure and will benefit from such organization. The Bureau has observed that many financial institutions currently organize the fees schedules in their prepaid account agreements in this manner. With regard to the change to “close proximity” in the final rule, the Bureau believes that, while the short form disclosure necessitates stricter requirements to achieve more precise standardization, financial institutions should have more discretion in the long form. To this end, the sample form for the long form disclosure, as opposed to the model forms for the short form disclosures, serves as an example of a disclosure structure financial institutions may emulate or use to develop their own long form disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In response to the industry commenters requesting examples of the categories of function required in the long form disclosure, the Bureau directs financial institutions to the sample long form disclosure, Sample Form A-10(f). The sample form is provided as an example that financial institutions may, but are not required to, incorporate or emulate in developing their own long form disclosures. The following categories of function that appear in the sample form can serve as examples of categories that financial institutions might use in designing their long form disclosures: Get started (disclosing the purchase price), Monthly usage (disclosing the monthly fee), Add money (disclosing fees for direct deposit and cash reload), Spend money (disclosing bill payment fees), Get cash (disclosing ATM withdrawal fees), Information (disclosing customer service and ATM balance inquiry fees), Using your card outside the U.S. (disclosing fees for international transactions, international ATM withdrawals, and international ATM balance inquiries), and Other (disclosing the inactivity fee). Financial institutions may use some or all of the categories in the sample form or may create their own categories.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Regarding the statements in the long form disclosure, the rule requires that the information in the long form disclosure required by final § 1005.18(b)(4)(iii) through (vi) be generally grouped together, provided in that order, and appear below the information required by final § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii). As in the short form disclosure, the Bureau believes that grouping together like categories of information here will improve readability and enhance consumer comprehension.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, the final rule explains that if, pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(4)(vii), the financial institution includes the disclosures described in Regulation Z § 1026.60(e)(1), such disclosures must appear below the disclosures required by final § 1005.18(b)(4)(vi).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 18(b)(7)(i)(B)-1 provides an example illustrating the meaning of close proximity as used in the final § 1005.18(b)(7)(i)(B). The comment states that, for example, a financial institution is deemed to comply with this requirement if the text describing the conditions is located directly to the right of the fee amount in the long form disclosure, as illustrated in Sample Form A-10(f). The comment also cross-references final comment 18(b)(6)(i)(B)-2 regarding stacking of electronic disclosures for display on smaller screen sizes. As discussed above, that comment describes how compliance with the requirements of § 1005.18(b)(7)(i)(B) may be achieved, for example, through stacking of the long form disclosure for a consumer viewing it on an electronic device with a smaller screen size.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 18(b)(7)(i)(B)-2 explains how to create a subheading by category of function for any finance charges that may be imposed on a prepaid account as described in Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in § 1026.61. The comment explains that, pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(7)(i)(B), the financial institution may, but is not required to, group all finance charges together under a single subheading. The comment goes on to say that this includes situations where the financial institution imposes a higher fee or charge on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card than the amount of a comparable fee or charge it imposes on any prepaid account in the same prepaid account program that does not have such a credit feature. The comment illustrates this with an example of a financial institution that charges on the prepaid account a $0.50 per transaction fee for each transaction that accesses funds in the asset feature of a prepaid account and a $1.25 per transaction fee for each transaction where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from the covered separate credit feature in the course of the transaction. In this case, the financial institution is permitted to disclose the $0.50 per transaction fee under a general transactional subheading and disclose the additional $0.75 per transaction fee under a separate subheading together with any other finance charges that may be imposed on the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(b)(7)(i)(A) Short Form Disclosure</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(b)(4)(i)(A) would have contained several formatting requirements for the short form disclosure. First, proposed § 1005.18(b)(4)(i)(A) would have stated that the information that would have been required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(A) or proposed § 1005.15(c)(2), when applicable, must be grouped together. Proposed § 1005.18(b)(4)(i)(A) would have further stated that the information that would have been required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) through (<em data-original="E-03">4</em>) must generally be grouped together and in the order they appear in the form of proposed Model Forms A-10(a) through (d). The Bureau believed that grouping the fees that would have been required to be disclosed by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) through (<em data-original="E-03">4</em>) in the top line of the short form disclosure would more effectively direct consumers' attention to these fees. The Bureau also believed that, when it is applicable, the payroll card account or government benefit account notice banner should appear at the top of the short form to ensure consumers understand that they do not have to accept such an account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(b)(4)(i)(A) would have further stated that the information required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">5</em>) through (<em data-original="E-03">9</em>) must generally be grouped together and in the order they appear in the form of proposed Model Forms A-10(a) through (d). The textual information required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">10</em>) through (<em data-original="E-03">14</em>) must be generally grouped together and in the order they appear in proposed Model Forms A-10(a) through (d). The Bureau recognized that some consumers may focus only on fee information and not review textual information, and noted that, in its pre-proposal consumer testing many participants did not notice some of the textual information included on prototype short forms until the facilitator pointed it out to them.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also proposed in § 1005.18(b)(4)(i)(A) that the Web site URL disclosed pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">11</em>) must not exceed 22 characters and must be meaningfully named. See the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiii) above for a discussion of this requirement in the final rule.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters addressed the proposed grouping or other related format requirements for the prepaid disclosures. A program manager supported the proposed grouping requirements saying they are reasonable and very similar to current disclosures, but cautioned that the short form disclosure format requirements would crowd out or dilute other critical information and oblige industry to extensively redesign current packaging. Another program manager said the rigidity of the format of the short form disclosure would limit the ability of industry to offer new types of prepaid cards. Two industry trade associations said the rule was unclear regarding the extent to which a financial institution could depart from the format of the required disclosures. In a comment generally addressing the format of the proposed disclosures, an issuing bank recommended that the short form and long form disclosures have the same format to avoid confusion and be recognizable.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein and in the absence of comments opposing the specific grouping requirements of the short form, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.18(b)(4)(i)(A), renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(7)(i)(A), with minor modifications. First, the Bureau has added references to the grouping requirements for the payroll card account disclosures set forth in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(A) and (B). Second, the Bureau has made technical modifications to the rule for conformity and clarity.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting the proposed grouping requirements for the short form disclosure essentially as proposed. As stated in the proposal, the Bureau designed the top line of the short form disclosure to direct consumers' attention to what it believes are the most important fees for consumers to know in advance of acquiring a prepaid account. With regard to the statement regarding wage or salary payment options required for payroll card account (and government benefit account) short form disclosures, the Bureau believes that consumers understanding that their job (or government benefit) is not contingent upon their acceptance of the payroll card (or government benefit card) is of paramount importance in the short form disclosure. As in the proposed rule, the final rule generally groups fees together and non-fee information together. Similar to the proposed rule, the final rule also groups together the statements regarding fees that can vary, including new provisions § 1005.18(b)(3)(ii) (variable fee disclosure for the periodic fee) and § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B) (State-required information or other fee discounts and waivers for payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has made minor changes to the proposed grouping requirements. First, to conform to the principle stated above to group fees together and group other information together, the Bureau has relocated the statement regarding overdraft and credit, required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(x), from the fee section in the proposed rule to a location among the non-fee other information. To more effectively connect the fee section with the statement regarding the number of additional fee types, required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A), the Bureau relocated this statement to the fee section. Finally, the new statement required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(B) directing consumers to the disclosure of additional fee types required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) is located immediately after the statement regarding the number of additional fee types charged and immediately before the disclosure of any actual additional fee types.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Specifically, the final rule requires that the information required in the short form disclosure by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (iv) must be grouped together and provided in that order. The information required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(v) through (ix) must be generally grouped together and provided in that order. The information required by final § 1005.18(b)(3)(i) and (ii), as applicable, must be generally grouped together and in the location described by § 1005.18(b)(3)(i) and (ii). The information required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(x) through (xiii) must be generally grouped together and provided in that order.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The final rule also provides that the statement regarding wage or salary payment options for payroll card accounts required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(A) must be located above the information required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (iv), as described in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(A). The statement regarding State-required information or other fee discounts or waivers permitted by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B), when applicable, must appear in the location described in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In response to comments generally addressing the format and formatting requirements of the short form and long form disclosures, the Bureau states that those requirements, together with the content requirements for the disclosures, were designed to create companion disclosures intended to facilitate consumers' prepaid account purchase and use decisions. The Bureau intended these disclosures to play very different but complementary roles and, thus, purposefully gave them different formats. The abridged nature of the short form, with its emphasis on key fees and information, versus the comprehensive nature of the long form, with its requirement to disclose, among other things, all fees and the conditions under which they may be imposed, require different formats that together create a synergistic whole.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Regarding the comments questioning the extent to which a financial institution could depart from the required format, financial institutions must comply with the disclosure requirements set forth in the final rule but the Bureau notes that the regulatory text and commentary contain additional information and direction clarifying specific requirements in the final rule, including a number of optional modifications. Also the Bureau is providing the model and sample forms to provide concrete illustrations of the requirements under the rule.<footnote ref="460">For the convenience of the prepaid industry and to help reduce development costs, the Bureau is also providing native design files for print and source code for web-based disclosures for all of the model and sample forms included in the final rule. These files are available at &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;www.consumerfinance.gov/prepaid-disclosure-files&lt;/em&gt;.</footnote>
             For examples of short form disclosures that comply with the grouping requirements of final § 1005.18(b)(7)(i)(A), see Model Forms A-10(a) through (d). Model Forms A-10(a) and (b) illustrate the grouping requirements specifically for payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts, respectively. Model Forms A-10(c) and (d) illustrate the grouping requirements for short form disclosures in general, including those sold in retail locations. Model Form A-10(e) illustrates the short form grouping requirements specifically for prepaid account programs with multiple service plans disclosed pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>); these grouping requirements are addressed in detail in final § 1005.18(b)(7)(i)(C) discussed below.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(iii) provided that a remittance transfer provider must disclose the name and, if provided by the sender, the telephone number and/or address of the designated recipient. The proposed rule stated that the remittance transfer provider must describe the disclosure using the term “Recipient” or a substantially similar term.

      <title>31(c)(2) Proximity</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(c)(2) provided that the exchange rate must be disclosed in close proximity to the other disclosures on the pre-payment disclosure. The Board stated in the May 2011 Proposed Rule that disclosing the exchange rate in close proximity to both the calculations that demonstrate the total transaction amount, as well as the total amount the recipient would receive, would help a sender understand the effect of the exchange rate on the transaction. Proposed § 205.31(c)(2) also provided that error resolution and cancellation disclosures must be disclosed in close proximity to the other disclosures on the receipt. The Board determined in consumer testing that providing a brief statement regarding error resolution and cancellation rights located near the other disclosures effectively communicated these rights to a sender. Therefore, the Board provided that the error resolution and cancellation disclosures should be closely proximate to the other disclosures on the receipt to prevent such disclosures from being overlooked by a sender.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comment on the proposed proximity requirements beyond the general comments addressing the proposed formatting requirements discussed above. Thus, the Bureau is adopting the proposed requirement substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(c)(2), with revisions to address the applicability of the proximity requirements to mobile applications and text messages. Section 1005.31(c)(2) states that the exchange rate disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) generally must be disclosed in close proximity to the other information required by § 1005.31(b)(1). The abbreviated statement about the sender's error resolution and cancellation rights required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) generally must be disclosed in close proximity to the other information required by § 1005.31(b)(2). Disclosures provided orally or via mobile application or text message, to the extent permitted by § 1005.31(a)(5), need not comply with the proximity requirements of § 1005.31(c)(2).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>31(c)(2) Proximity</title>
      <analysisParagraph>To effectuate EFTA section 919(a)(3)(A), § 1005.31(c)(2) of the 2012 Final Rule also requires that certain disclosures be placed in close proximity to each other.  The purpose of this proximity requirement is to prevent such disclosures from being overlooked by a sender.  As previously discussed, under the 2013 Final Rule the disclosure of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected by a person other than the provider is no longer required under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi); instead, remittance transfer providers are subject to the new disclosure provision of § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii).  Consequently, the 2013 Final Rule amends § 1005.31(c) to require that the new § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) disclaimers be in close proximity with the disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) (the amount received by the designated recipient).  Section 1005.31(c)(2) further notes that disclosures provided via mobile application or text message, to the extent permitted by § 1005.31(a)(5), generally need not comply with the proximity requirements of § 1005.31(c), except that information required or permitted by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) must follow the information required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii).  The Bureau believes that it is important that the new disclaimers—which advise of potential additional fees and taxes—be grouped in close proximity to the disclosure of the amount to be received by the designated recipient.  Insofar as the total amount to be received may not include certain items the disclosure of which is no longer required, the disclaimers should be placed in close proximity to, or in the case of disclosures provided via mobile application or text message follow, the disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) in order to maximize the likelihood that senders will see the disclaimers and read them in conjunction with the amount disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii). </analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(c)(1) provided that the information about the transfer amount, fees and taxes imposed by the provider, and total amount of transaction must be grouped together. The purpose of this grouping requirement was to make clear to the sender that the total amount charged is comprised of the transfer amount plus any transfer fees and taxes. Proposed § 205.31(c)(1) also provided that the information about the transfer amount in the currency to be made available to the designated recipient, fees and taxes imposed by a person other than the provider, and amount received by the designated recipient must be grouped together. The purpose of this grouping requirement was to make clear to the sender how the total amount to be transferred to the designated recipient, in the currency to be made available to the designated recipient, would be reduced by fees or taxes charged by a person other than the remittance transfer provider.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comments on the proposed grouping requirements beyond the general comments about the proposed formatting requirements, discussed above. Thus, the Bureau is adopting the proposed requirement substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(c)(1), with revisions to address the applicability of the grouping requirements to mobile applications and text messages. Section 1005.31(c)(1) states that the information required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) generally must be grouped together. The information required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(v), (vi), and (vii) generally must be grouped together. Disclosures provided via mobile application or text message, to the extent permitted by § 1005.31(a)(5), need not be grouped together.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(c)(1)-1 is also adopted substantially as proposed. The comment clarifies that information is grouped together for purposes of subpart B if multiple disclosures are in close proximity to one another and a sender can reasonably calculate the total amount of the transaction, and the amount that will be received by the designated recipient. Proposed Model Forms A-30 through A-35 in Appendix A, discussed in more detail below, illustrate how information may be grouped to comply with the rule. The proposed comment also clarifies that a remittance transfer provider may group the information in another manner. For example, a provider could provide the grouped information as a horizontal, rather than a vertical, calculation.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>31(c)(1) Grouping</title>
      <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(3)(A) states that disclosures provided pursuant to EFTA section 919 must be clear and conspicuous.  The 2012 Final Rule incorporates this requirement and sets forth grouping, proximity, prominence, size, and segregation requirements to ensure that it is satisfied.  In particular, § 1005.31(c)(1) requires that information about the transfer amount, fees and taxes imposed by a person other than the provider, and amount received by the designated recipient be grouped together.  The purpose of this grouping requirement is to make clear to the sender how the total amount to be transferred to the designated recipient, in the currency to be made available to the designated recipient, will be reduced by fees imposed or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider.  As previously discussed, under the 2013 Final Rule the disclosure of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider is no longer required under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), or included in the calculation of the amount required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii), but instead is subject to new § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii).  Consequently, the 2013 Final Rule amends § 1005.31(c)(1) to group the new § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) disclosure requirement with the information required by §§ 1005.31(b)(1)(v), (vi), and (vii).  The Bureau believes that this grouping will ensure that the sender will understand that the total amount received by the designated recipient will be affected by these additional fees and taxes as applicable.  In addition, the Bureau clarifies that although disclosures provided via mobile application or text message to the extent permitted by § 1005.31(a)(5) generally need not comply with the grouping requirements, information required or permitted by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) must be grouped with § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii).  The Bureau believes that it is important that the new disclaimers—which advise of potential additional fees and taxes—be grouped with the disclosure of the amount to be received by the designated recipient in order to maximize the likelihood that senders will see the disclaimers and read them in conjunction with the disclosures under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii).  Insofar as the Bureau is requiring that information required or permitted by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) be grouped with § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) for disclosures provided via mobile application or text message, the Bureau is adding guidance in comment 31(c)(1)-1 to explain that to comply with the requirement a provider could send multiple text messages sequentially to provide the full disclosure.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>33(c)(2) Remedies</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed § 205.33(c)(2) to establish the procedures and remedies for correcting an error. Proposed § 205.33(c)(2)(i) and (ii) included the two remedies that are specified in EFTA section 919(d)(1)(B). Under proposed § 205.33(c)(2), the sender may designate the preferred remedy in the event of an error, consistent with EFTA section 919(d)(1)(B). Thus, under proposed § 205.33(c)(2)(i), the sender could choose to obtain a refund of the amount tendered in connection with the remittance transfer that was not properly transmitted, or an amount appropriate to resolve the error. Alternatively, under proposed § 205.33(c)(2)(ii), the sender could choose to have the remittance transfer provider send to the designated recipient the amount appropriate to resolve the error, at no additional cost to the sender or the designated recipient. The Bureau did not receive any comments objecting to these remedies. Therefore, the statutory remedies set forth in proposed § 205.33(c)(2)(i) and (ii) are adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(c)(2)(i)(A) and (B), respectively, for errors under § 1005.33(a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(iii), and § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) and (<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), respectively, for an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv). Thus, the final rule clarifies that these remedies do not apply to a sender's request for documentation or for additional information or clarification under § 1005.33(a)(1)(v), where the appropriate remedy is the requested documentation, information, or clarification. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) as discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>However, as discussed above with respect to proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(B), the Bureau believes that if the failure to make funds from a remittance transfer available on the disclosed date of availability is caused by the sender providing incorrect information in connection with the remittance transfer to the provider, the sender's mistake should not obligate a remittance transfer provider to bear all the costs for resending the remittance transfer. As noted above, many industry commenters objected to the requirement that the remittance transfer provider absorb the costs of amending and resending a transfer when the sender is at fault because doing so would require the remittance transfer provider and other senders, through higher fees, to bear the responsibility for a sender's mistake.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Therefore, § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) does not require that providers send to the designated recipient the amount appropriate to resolve the error at no additional cost to the sender or the designated recipient if the sender provided incorrect information in connection with the remittance transfer to the provider. Instead, § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) provides that if the sender provided incorrect information to the remittance transfer provider in connection with the remittance transfer, third party fees may be imposed for resending the remittance transfer with the corrected information. Section 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) permits third party fees and taxes that were actually incurred in the earlier transmission attempt to be imposed for the resend, but does not permit remittance transfer providers to charge senders a second time for the provider's own fees.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is making this distinction in order to apply the rule without requiring complicated individualized analyses and allocations of the expenses actually incurred in connection with a failed transaction. The Bureau believes this approach strikes a more appropriate balance between the interests of providers and senders than the proposed rule of not permitting any fees to be imposed for the resend, given that third party fees and taxes are not controlled by the provider and are simply being passed on from other actors. Furthermore, the Bureau believes that affiliates of remittance transfer providers, like providers themselves, should not assess fees for resending a remittance transfer with corrected information.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also believes that if a sender provides insufficient information to enable the remittance transfer provider to complete the transfer as requested, third party fees should be permitted to be imposed for resending the remittance transfer with the additional information. For example, a sender may only provide a partial name for the designated recipient such that the entity distributing the funds cannot determine whether the person picking up the funds or the name associated with the account is the intended designated recipient. Therefore, § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) provides that if the sender provided insufficient information to the remittance transfer provider in connection with the remittance transfer, third party fees may be imposed for resending the remittance transfer with the additional information.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adopting a new comment 33(c)-2 to clarify § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>). The comment generally incorporates proposed comment 33(a)-6 to clarify that if the failure to make funds from a transfer available by the disclosed date of availability occurred due to the provider's miscommunication of information necessary for the designated recipient to pick up the transfer, such as providing the incorrect location where the transfer may be picked up or providing the wrong confirmation number or code for the transfer, such failure would not be treated as a failure caused by the sender providing incorrect or insufficient information in connection with the remittance transfer to the provider. The comment also clarifies that while third party fees may be imposed for resending the remittance transfer with the corrected or additional information, the remittance transfer provider may not require the sender to provide the principal transfer amount again.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, if funds were not exchanged in the first unsuccessful attempt of the remittance transfer, the provider must use the exchange rate it is using for such transfers on the date of the resend. The Bureau recognizes that this approach is different from the approach adopted for other errors, where the provider must apply the exchange rate stated in the receipt or combined disclosure. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 33(c)-3, discussed below. For errors where the failure was not caused by the sender providing incorrect or insufficient information, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate for the remedy to reflect what was promised to the sender. In contrast, when the failure is caused by the sender providing incorrect or insufficient information, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to generally put the provider and the sender in the same position as if the first unsuccessful attempt of the remittance transfer had never occurred.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For example, if a sender instructs a remittance transfer provider to send US$100 to a designated recipient in a foreign country in local currency, for which the remittance transfer provider charges a transfer fee of US$10, and the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information that resulted in non-delivery of the remittance transfer, the remittance transfer provider may not require the sender to provide another US$100 to the remittance transfer provider to send or charge the sender another US$10 transfer fee. If the funds were not exchanged in the first unsuccessful attempt of the remittance transfer, the provider must use the exchange rate it is using for such transfers on the date of the resend.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Based on this rule, if a remittance transfer is deposited in an account that does not belong to the designated recipient named in the receipt because the sender provided the wrong account number for the designated recipient, the provider may charge the sender for resending the remittance transfer, but may not have the sender provide the principal transfer amount again in the event that the remittance transfer provider is unable to have the funds extracted from the wrong account. The Bureau believes that this approach will encourage providers and other parties involved in the remittance transfer to develop security procedures to limit the risk of funds being deposited in an account when the name of the designated recipient named in the receipt does not match the name associated with the account number. The Bureau notes that remittance transfer providers will be supplied with both the name, and if provided by the sender, the telephone number and/or address of the designated recipient, which the provider must disclose on the receipt under § 1005.31(b)(2)(iii).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 33(c)-2 clarifies that although third party fees may be imposed on the sender for resending the remittance transfer with the corrected or additional information, third party fees that were not incurred during the first unsuccessful remittance transfer attempt may not be imposed again for resending the remittance transfer. For example, suppose a sender instructed the remittance transfer provider to send US$100 to a designated recipient in a foreign country, for which a remittance transfer provider charges a transfer fee of US$10 and an intermediary institution charges a lifting fee of US$5, such that the designated recipient is expected to receive only US$95, as indicated in the receipt. If the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information that resulted in non-delivery of the remittance transfer and the US$5 lifting fee was incurred in the first attempt, the sender may choose to provide an additional amount to offset the US$5 lifting fee deducted in the first unsuccessful remittance transfer attempt and ensure that the designated recipient receives US$95 or may choose to resend the US$95 amount with the understanding that another fee may be deducted by the intermediary institution, as indicated in the receipt. Otherwise, if the US$5 lifting fee was not incurred in the first attempt, then the remittance transfer provider must send the original US$100 for the resend, and the sender may expect a US$5 lifting fee to be imposed by the intermediary institution, as indicated in the receipt. Comment 33(c)-2 also reminds providers that a request to resend a remittance transfer is a request to send a remittance transfer. Therefore, a provider must provide the disclosures required by § 1005.31 for a resend of a remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Board proposed to add a separate, cumulative remedy that would apply if the transfer was not made available to the designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv). This additional remedy was proposed pursuant to the Board's authority under EFTA section 919(d)(1)(B) to provide “such other remedy” as the Board determines appropriate “for the protection of senders.” Under proposed § 205.33(c)(2)(iii), if the remittance transfer was not sent or delivered to the designated recipient by the stated date of availability, the remittance transfer provider would be required to refund all fees charged or imposed in connection with the transfer, even if the consumer asks the provider to send the remittance transfer to the designated recipient as the preferred remedy. If the funds have already been delivered to the recipient, however, even if on an untimely basis, the sole remedy in such case would be the refund of fees.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters objected to the remedy to refund all fees associated with the remittance transfer. As the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, requiring the provider to refund all fees imposed in connection with the remittance transfer, including the transfer fee, is appropriate under such circumstances because the sender did not receive the contracted service, specifically the availability of funds in connection with the transfer by the disclosed date. Furthermore, the Board noted that in some cases, the sender may have paid an additional fee for expedited delivery of funds.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Based on some industry comments, the Bureau believes there may be some confusion regarding when the proposed remedy of refunding fees associated with the remittance transfer may be available. As stated in proposed § 205(c)(2)(iii), the remedy is only available in the case of an error asserted under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv) (adopted as § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) above). Accordingly, if the remittance transfer provider finds that the error that occurred is, for example, an incorrect amount paid by a sender in connection with a remittance transfer under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(i) (adopted as § 1005.33(a)(1)(i) above), the provider would be under no obligation to refund the fees associated with the remittance transfer to a sender. Instead, the only remedies required to be available to a sender would be a refund of the amount appropriate to resolve the error under proposed § 205(c)(2)(i) (adopted as § 1005(c)(2)(i)(A) above) or to have the amount appropriate to resolve the error sent to the designated recipient, at no additional cost to the sender or the designated recipient under proposed § 205.33(c)(2)(ii) (adopted as § 1005(c)(2)(i)(B) above).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with the Board that the remedy of refunding all fees imposed for the remittance transfer is appropriate if the remittance transfer was not made available to the designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, the Bureau believes that taxes should also be refunded. One industry commenter noted that for certain jurisdictions, the remittance transfer provider may be prohibited by law from refunding taxes. Therefore, the Bureau adopts proposed § 205.33(c)(2)(iii) in renumbered § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B) with the additional requirement to refund taxes to the extent not prohibited by law.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Moreover, consistent with § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), which provides that third party fees may be imposed for resending the remittance transfer if the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information to the remittance transfer provider in connection with the remittance transfer, § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B) provides that the provider need not refund fees imposed for the remittance transfer if the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information to the remittance transfer provider in connection with the remittance transfer. The Bureau is also adopting new § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) to clarify that in the case of an error asserted under § 1005.33(a)(1)(v), which is a request for documentation, additional information or clarification concerning a remittance transfer, the appropriate remedy is providing the requested documentation, information, or clarification.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(c)(2) also provided that the remittance transfer provider must correct the error within one business day of, or as soon as reasonably practicable after, receiving the sender's instructions regarding the appropriate remedy. The Board explained that the proposed rule would provide additional flexibility to address the limited circumstances where the particular method of sending a remittance transfer may present practical impediments to a provider's ability to correct an error within one business day. For example, it may not be practicable for a wire transfer that goes through several intermediary institutions before reaching the designated recipient to make the amount in error available to the recipient within one business day in accordance with a sender's request. The Bureau agrees with the Board's rationale in requiring the remittance transfer provider to correct the error within one business day of, or as soon as reasonably practicable after, receiving the sender's instructions regarding the appropriate remedy. The Bureau retains this aspect of proposed § 205.33(c)(2) in renumbered § 1005.33(c)(2) and also includes other clarifying, non-substantive changes.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 33(c)-2 clarified that the remittance transfer provider may request that the sender designate the preferred remedy at the time the sender provides notice of error. As the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, permitting such requests may enable providers to process error claims more expeditiously without waiting for the sender's subsequent instructions after notifying the sender of the results of the investigation. If the sender does not indicate the desired remedy at the time of providing notice of error, the proposed comment provided that the remittance transfer provider must notify the sender of any available remedies in the report provided under proposed § 205.33(c)(1) (adopted as § 1005(c)(1) above) after determining an error occurred. Proposed comment 33(c)-2 is adopted as comment 33(c)-3.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>However, the Board recognized in the May 2011 Proposed Rule that by giving the sender the ability to choose the remedy, the statute, and thus the rule, may make it impossible for a remittance transfer provider to promptly correct an error if the consumer fails to designate an appropriate remedy either at the time of providing the notice of error or in response to the provider's notice informing the consumer of its error determination and available remedies. The Board therefore requested comment on whether remittance transfer providers should be permitted to select a default method of correcting errors.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Both industry and consumer group commenters agreed that there should be a default method of correcting errors. Industry commenters suggested that the remittance transfer provider should be permitted to select the default remedy. Consumer group commenters, however, recommended that the Bureau should set the default remedy of refunding to the sender the appropriate amount.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Based on the comments received, the Bureau adopts a new comment 33(c)-4 to permit a remittance transfer provider to select a default remedy that the provider will use if the sender does not designate a remedy within a reasonable time after the sender receives the report provided under § 1005.33(c)(1). The Bureau believes that providing for a default remedy after a sender has had a reasonable opportunity to choose a remedy would balance the statute's aim to provide a sender the chance to choose his or her preferred remedy with the goal of promptly resolving the sender's outstanding error claim. Furthermore, allowing remittance transfer providers to select the default remedy reduces burden on providers without consumer harm because providers have the ability to provide a preferred remedy without compromising a sender's opportunity to choose.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In addition, new comment 33(c)-4 provides a safe harbor for the amount of time that would be considered reasonable after the report under § 1005.33(c)(1) is provided. Specifically, comment 33(c)-4 states that a provider that permits a sender to designate a remedy within 10 days after the provider has sent the report provided under § 1005.33(c)(1) before selecting the default remedy is deemed to have provided the sender with a reasonable time to designate a remedy. In selecting the 10-day time frame as a safe harbor, the Bureau notes the existence of a similar provision under Regulation Z. Under the commentary to 12 CFR 1026.5(b)(1)(i), a creditor that provides an account-opening disclosure in connection with a balance transfer may effectuate the balance transfer if the consumer has not withdrawn the balance transfer request within 10 days after the creditor has sent the account-opening disclosure. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 5(b)(1)(i)-5 under Regulation Z. New comment 33(c)-4 also clarifies that in the case a default remedy is provided, the remittance transfer provider must correct the error within one business day, or as soon as reasonably practicable, after the reasonable time for the sender to designate the remedy has passed.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters also suggested that the Bureau adopt guidance on how to handle cases where a sender cannot be contacted after an error is discovered by the provider, sender, or recipient. These commenters recommended that three phone calls or emails should constitute a good faith effort to contact the sender. The Bureau notes that the error resolution procedures only apply if the sender asserts an error. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 33(b)-1 adopted above. A notice of error from a sender must contain information to enable the provider to identify the sender's name and telephone number or address. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(b)(1)(ii)(A) adopted above. Therefore, the Bureau believes that remittance transfer providers will have valid contact information from the sender when the sender asserts the error and that remittance transfer providers will make a reasonable effort to contact senders to fulfill their error resolution requirements.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters requested that the final rule clarify the meaning of “amount appropriate to resolve the error.” The Bureau agrees that clarification of this term would be helpful. New comment 33(c)-5 provides that for the purposes of the remedies set forth in § 1005.33(c)(2)(i)(A), (c)(2)(i)(B), (c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>), and (c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), the amount appropriate to resolve the error is the specific amount of transferred funds that should have been received if the remittance transfer had been effected without error. New comment 33(c)-5 further clarifies that the amount appropriate to resolve the error does not include consequential damages.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters requested further guidance on the form a refund may take. In particular, commenters were concerned that remittance transfer providers not be permitted to provide store credit in the refund amount. The Bureau agrees that the form of any refund provided under § 1005.33(c)(2)(i)(A) should generally be the same as the form of payment for the remittance transfer. The Bureau also believes that a provider should also be permitted to provide a refund in cash. Therefore, the Bureau adopts new comment 33(c)-6 to clarify that a remittance transfer provider may, at its discretion, issue a refund either in cash or in the same form of payment that was initially provided by the sender for the remittance transfer. The comment is similar to comment 34(b)-1, discussed below, regarding the form of refund after a cancellation.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is, however, amending comment 34(b)-1 in one respect, which is also reflected in new comment 33(c)-6. Specifically, the Bureau recognizes that if a sender provided cash to the remittance transfer provider for the remittance transfer, there may be instances when a cash refund may not be possible or convenient to the sender. Generally, it is undesirable for a provider to mail cash, and agents may be prohibited from providing cash to consumers. Even if agents were permitted to provide cash refunds, it may be inconvenient to the sender to return to the remittance transfer provider or agent location to pick up the cash refund. Consequently, comments 33(c)-6 and 34(b)-1 state that a provider may issue a refund by check if a sender initially provided cash for the remittance transfer. For example, if the sender originally provided cash as payment for the transfer, the provider may mail a check to the sender in the amount of the payment.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters also suggested that the Bureau consider emphasizing that remittance transfer providers should comply with applicable State escheat laws if the sender cannot be contacted to receive a refund. The Bureau believes that such clarification is unnecessary. Furthermore, the Bureau is concerned that an explicit reference to State escheat laws in this instance may imply that other State laws (for example, State disclosure requirements for money transmitters) do not apply. Consequently, the Bureau declines to adopt this suggestion.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 33(c)-3 provided additional guidance regarding the appropriate remedies where the sender has paid an excess amount to send a remittance transfer. Under that circumstance, the sender may request a refund of the amount paid in excess or may request that the remittance transfer provider make that excess amount available to the designated recipient at no additional cost. The Bureau did not receive any comments on the proposed comment. The Bureau adopts proposed comment 33(c)-3 substantially as proposed in comment 33(c)-7.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Under proposed comment 33(c)-4, fees that must be refunded to a sender for a failure to make funds from a remittance transfer available by the stated date of availability under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) include all fees imposed for the transfer, regardless of the party that imposed the fee, and are not limited to fees imposed by the provider. Some industry commenters objected to having to refund fees not imposed by the remittance transfer provider. As explained above, however, the Bureau believes that refunding all fees is appropriate if the remittance transfer service was not provided as contracted because the funds were not made available by the disclosed date of availability.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is revising proposed comment 33(c)-4, however, to respond to a request from a Federal Reserve Bank commenter to resolve ambiguities in the relationship between the remedies in § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) and (<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) and the remedy in § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B). Specifically, the Bureau has revised proposed comment 33(c)-4, renumbered as comment 33(c)-8, to clarify that the remittance transfer provider must correct the error in accordance with § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A), as applicable. Therefore, if the remittance transfer was made available to the designated recipient, but on an untimely basis, the remedies under § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A) would not be applicable. In that circumstance, the “amount appropriate to resolve the error” would be zero since the entire transfer amount was made available to the designated recipient. The sender's only remedy in this case would be the refund of fees under § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B). If, however, the funds were never made available to the designated recipient, then the sender would have one of the remedies available under § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) or (<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) in addition to the remedy of the fee refund under § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B). The Bureau also believes the renumbering in § 1005.33(c)(2) should make this clear.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 33(c)-5 clarified that if an error occurred, whether as alleged or in a different amount or manner, a remittance transfer provider may not impose any charges related to any aspect of the error resolution process, including any charges for documentation or investigation. As discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the Board expressed concern that such fees or charges might have a chilling effect on a sender's good faith assertion of errors and noted that the proposed comment is similar to comment 11(c)-3 for EFTs. Proposed 33(c)-5, however, also stated that nothing would prohibit a remittance transfer provider from imposing a fee for making copies of documentation for non-error-resolution-related purposes, such as for tax documentation purposes under § 1005.33(a)(2)(iii). The Bureau did not receive any comments on the proposed comment. Therefore, the Bureau adopts proposed comment 33(c)-5 as proposed in comment 33(c)-9.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, under proposed comment 33(c)-6, a remittance transfer provider may correct an error, without further investigation, in the amount or manner alleged by the sender to be in error. This is similar to comment 11(c)-4 for EFTs. As with comment 11(c)-4, the provider must otherwise comply with all other applicable requirements of the error resolution procedures, including providing notice of the resolution of the error. Commenters did not address this proposed comment. Therefore, the Bureau adopts proposed comment 33(c)-6 substantially as proposed in comment 33(c)-10.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>33(c)(2) Remedies</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.33(c)(2) of the 2012 Final Rule implements EFTA section 919(d)(1)(B) and establishes procedures and remedies for correcting an error under the rule.  In particular, where there has been an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) for failure to make funds available to a designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability, § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii) of the 2012 Final Rule permits a sender to choose either to:  (1) Obtain a refund of the amount tendered in connection with the remittance that was not properly transmitted, or an amount appropriate to resolve the error; or (2) have the remittance transfer provider resend to the designated recipient the amount appropriate to resolve the error, at no additional cost to the sender or designated recipient. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A).  However, if the error resulted from the sender having provided incorrect or insufficient information, § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) permits third-party fees to be imposed for resending the remittance transfer with the corrected information although the provider may not charge its own fee again.  In addition, comment 33(c)-2 explains that § 1005.33(c)(2) requires a remittance transfer provider to resend a transfer at the exchange rate it is using on the date of resend if funds were not already exchanged in the first unsuccessful remittance transfer attempt.  Comment 33(c)-2 in the 2012 Final Rule also explains that the provider was required to disclose this new exchange rate to senders in accordance with § 1005.31. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The December Proposal would have allowed for additional flexibility in providing the required disclosures when funds are resent following errors that occurred because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information.  The December Proposal was intended to address concerns expressed by industry participants that the approach taken in the 2012 Final Rule created certain operational tensions between the timing and accuracy provisions in § 1005.31(e) and (f), as referenced in comments 33(c)-2, 33(c)-3, and 33(c)-4, which together did not allow a remittance transfer provider to resend a transfer in some circumstances without contacting the sender because the sender either previously requested that the transfer be resent or the provider is employing its default remedy, which is to resend the transfer. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>To reduce this tension, the December Proposal would have created a new § 1005.33(c)(3), revised comment 33(c)-2 and added a new comment 33(c)-11.  Proposed § 1005.33(c)(3) would have provided new remedy procedures for errors that occurred pursuant to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) where a sender provides incorrect or insufficient information.  These proposed procedures would have allowed remittance transfer providers to provide oral, streamlined disclosures.  The proposed commentary would have made clear that providers need not treat resends of remittance transfers as entirely new remittance transfers.  Under proposed § 1005.33(c)(3)(i), a provider would have been able to set a future date of transfer and to disclose an estimated exchange rate pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2) if the provider did not make direct contact with the sender.  If a provider had disclosed an estimated exchange rate under proposed § 1005.33(c)(3)(i), the rule would have required the sender to disclose the cancellation period pursuant to § 1005.36(c), as well as the date the provider will complete the resend, using the term “Transfer Date” or a substantially similar term.  A sender would have been allowed to cancel the resend up to three business days before the date of transfer.  In the alternative, proposed § 1005.33(c)(3)(ii) would have required a provider that made direct contact with the sender to disclose and apply the exchange rate used for remittance transfers on the date of resend, rather than providing an estimate. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Under § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) of the 2012 Final Rule, a remittance transfer provider could impose third-party fees, but not include taxes, for resending the remittance transfer when an error occurred because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information.  Separately, the 2012 Final Rule did not state expressly whether a provider should be permitted to deduct third-party fees imposed or taxes collected on a remittance transfer when a transfer is returned from an institution abroad, following a failed delivery, to the provider before being resent or refunded.  In the December Proposal, the Bureau also sought comment on whether the provider should be permitted to impose taxes incurred when resending funds or, more generally, whether other remedies were appropriate with respect to fees and taxes. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>With respect to the appropriate remedy for errors that occurred because a sender provided incorrect or insufficient information, industry commenters generally stated that they appreciated the Bureau's attempt to revise the resend procedures in the 2012 Final Rule.  However, those who commented on this issue stated that the Bureau's proposed approach was too complicated because proposed § 1005.33(c)(3) required disclosures with distinct content, timing and accuracy requirements that did not necessarily apply to other disclosures required by the 2012 Final Rule, particularly if the provider was not otherwise providing the disclosures unique to transfer scheduled before the date of transfer. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.36(a).  As a result, these commenters contended that the new requirements would necessitate the development of additional disclosures, systems changes, and additional employee training.  Commenters asserted that proposed § 1005.33(c)(3) would be difficult, costly, and time-consuming to implement and that they had concerns about the compliance costs and operation challenges posed by this part of the December Proposal.  Instead, several industry trade association commenters suggested an alternative approach, under which a remittance transfer provider would provide notice that the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information in connection with a remittance transfer, that funds had been credited (at the current exchange rate) to the sender's account, and that the sender should notify the provider if the sender wished to initiate a new remittance transfer.  Commenters argued that this approach would simplify the remedy in situations where an error occurs due a sender's mistake. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Commenters further suggested that the Bureau should not allow a sender to designate a resend remedy prior to the remittance transfer provider's investigation of the error, permitted under § 1005.33(c)(2) as explained by comment 33(c)-2.  Instead, regardless of the sender's prior remedy election, the commenters advocated requiring the sender to elect affirmatively to resend funds after the provider completed its investigation and the sender received notice of that investigation and the related refund. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As for the amount appropriate to refund or resend, industry commenters generally urged the Bureau to revise the 2012 Final Rule so that remittance transfer providers are permitted to deduct from the amount refunded or resent the fees imposed or taxes collected on the first unsuccessful transfer by a party other than the provider both when the transfer was initially sent and when it was returned to the provider.  These commenters contended that it was unfair that providers would also have to refund to senders any amounts actually deducted from the transfer amount when a mis-delivered transfer is returned to the provider (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> lifting fees and taxes deducted from the transfer amount in the process of returning the funds to the provider in the United States after the failed delivery of the initial transaction). </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Based on comments received and upon further consideration, the Bureau adopts new § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii), which states that in the case of an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) that occurred because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information in connection with the remittance transfer, the remittance transfer provider shall refund to the sender the amount of funds provided by the sender in connection with the remittance transfer that was not properly transmitted, or the amount appropriate to resolve the error, within three business days of providing the report required by § 1005.33(c)(1) or (d)(1) except that the provider may agree to the sender's request, upon receiving the results of the error investigation, that the funds be applied towards a new remittance transfer, rather than be refunded, if the provider has not yet processed a refund.  The provider may deduct from the amount refunded or applied towards a new transfer any fees actually imposed on or, to the extent not prohibited by law, taxes actually collected on the remittance transfer as part of the first unsuccessful remittance transfer attempt.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting this approach because it has concluded that for the small number of transactions to which these provisions would likely apply, the Bureau's proposed alternative to the 2012 Final Rule's approach could be complicated for remittance transfer providers to implement.  The Bureau is adopting the revised provision in § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) rather than in § 1005.33(c)(3), as originally proposed, because the Bureau believes it more appropriate to put all remedies for errors arising under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) under subsection § 1005.33(c)(2).  Accordingly, the Bureau is revising §§ 1005.33(c)(2) and (c)(2)(ii) to make clear that these provisions only apply when an error did not occur because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information.  Similarly, the Bureau is also revising §§ 1005.33(c)(2)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) and (c)(2)(B) to remove references to situations in which an error occurred because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information.  The provision that was § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) in the 2012 Final Rule is finalized as § 1005.33(c)(2)(iv) with no substantive changes.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Specifically, the Bureau is adopting this new approach because of the challenges associated with both resending a transfer at a new exchange rate and timely disclosing such rate to the sender.  The Bureau is convinced by commenters' assertions that the Bureau's attempts to make disclosures more streamlined and reduce the number of paper disclosures provided could potentially increase the cost of compliance for remittance transfer providers, by necessitating changes in disclosures and procedures.  Furthermore, the Bureau believes that the new § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) will preserve the 2012 Final Rule's protections for senders in event of a resend that follows an error that occurred due to a sender's mistake. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Although commenters suggested that an alternative where funds could be credited instantly to a sender's account, not all remittance transfers are made from an account.  In some cases, a sender may not receive notice immediately or the sender would have to wait to resend funds until receiving the refund check. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 33(c)-6.  As adopted, under § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) in the 2013 Final Rule, in situations where a sender wants to resend the transfer, the sender would have to make a request to the remittance transfer provider after receipt of the error investigation report and the provider would treat the remittance transfer as a new remittance transfer request subject to the same disclosures and other procedures as any other new transfer requested.  The transaction would be subject to applicable fees and taxes and processed at the exchange rate in effect at the time the sender authorizes the new transfer. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Additionally, the Bureau agrees with commenters that it is not appropriate, in situations where funds are returned because of a sender's mistake, for the remittance transfer provider to have to bear the cost of fees imposed by third parties and taxes that have been collected in connection with the unsuccessful remittance transfer and, if applicable, when the undelivered funds are returned to the provider.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, although the Bureau had also sought comment on the exchange rate that should apply when transfers are resent following an error that occurred because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information, that issue is largely moot insofar as the 2013 Final Rule requires these transactions to be treated as new remittance transfers.  As explained by comment 33(c)-2 in the 2012 Final Rule, if a remittance transfer was to be resent because an error occurred following a sender's mistake, the original exchange rate applied to the resend of the transfer.  Thus, the recipient would have received the same amount and type of currency that the sender had provided to fund the transfer.  Industry commenters generally had argued that a sender should not benefit from an exchange rate that has changed in the sender's favor due to an error that occurred because of the sender's mistake and thus the same exchange rate that applied to the original transfer should apply to the resent transfer.  Insofar as the Bureau is revising the remedy in the 2013 Final Rule for errors that occurred because of a sender's mistake, if a sender chooses to resend a remittance transfer under the revised rule and the remittance transfer provider agrees, the remittance transfer will be treated as a new remittance transfer, and thus the exchange rate used for transfers on the date of resend will necessarily apply to it.  Insofar as providers are concerned with the exchange rate used when funds are refunded to the sender in the original currency, the Bureau believes it appropriate to maintain the originally disclosed exchange rate insofar as the refund should put the parties in the same position they were in prior to the transfer, less the taxes and fees that the provider may deduct. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Revisions to the Official Interpretations of § 1005.33(c)(2)</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As noted above, in the December Proposal, the Bureau proposed to modify comment 33(c)-2 to eliminate a phrase stating that requests to resend (following an error that occurred because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information) are considered requests for remittance transfers.  Relatedly, proposed comment 33(c)-11 would have clarified how to provide the disclosures required by proposed § 1005.33(c)(3).  Insofar as resends, as they existed in the 2012 Final Rule, will no longer be permitted as remedies for errors pursuant to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) where a sender provided incorrect or insufficient information, the Bureau is not adopting these proposed revisions to comment 33(c)-2.  The December Proposal also would have revised comment 33(c)-2 to correspond with the proposed exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) by removing the comment's reference to senders' mistakes about an account number and to make clear that no error would have occurred in this situation if the remittance transfer provider satisfied the requirements of proposed § 1005.33(h).  The Bureau received no comments regarding the specific amendments to proposed § 1005.33(c)(2) and comment 33(c)-2, with respect to the proposed adjustments necessary to correspondent to the proposed exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D).  Consequently, those portions of proposed comment 33(c)-2 are adopted as proposed with some alterations to improve clarity. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 33(c)-2, as finalized in the 2013 Final Rule, now states that the remedy in § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) applies if a remittance transfer provider's failure to make funds in connection with a remittance transfer available to a designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability occurred because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information in connection with the transfer, such as by erroneously identifying the designated recipient's address or by providing insufficient information such that the entity distributing the funds cannot identify the correct designated recipient.  A sender is not considered to have provided incorrect or insufficient information for purposes of § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) if the provider discloses the incorrect location where the transfer may be picked up, gives the wrong confirmation number/code for the transfer, or otherwise miscommunicates information necessary for the designated recipient to pick-up the transfer.  The remedies in § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) do not apply if the sender provided an incorrect account number or recipient institution identifier and the provider has met the requirements of § 1005.33(h) because under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) no error would have occurred. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) and comment 33(a)-7.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adopting a new comment 33(c)-11, which reflects the new refund procedure, and which replaces language regarding resends from comment 33(c)-2.  As revised in the 2013 Final Rule, comment 33(c)-11 states that § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) generally requires a remittance transfer provider to refund the transfer amount to the sender even if the sender's previously designated remedy was a resend or if the provider's default remedy in other circumstances is a resend.  However, if before the refund is processed, the sender receives notice pursuant to § 1005.33(c)(1) or (d)(1) that an error occurred because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information and then requests that the provider send the remittance transfer again, and the provider agrees to that request, § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) requires that the request be treated as a new remittance transfer and the provider must provide new disclosures in accordance with § 1005.31 and all other applicable provisions of subpart B.  However, § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) does not obligate the provider to agree to a sender's request to send a new remittance transfer. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.33(c)(2)(iii), as adopted in the 2013 Final Rule, applies in situations where an error occurs because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information, and overrides provisions that generally permit both a sender's prior selection of a resend remedy, <em data-original="E-03">see</em> comment 33(c)-3, and a remittance transfer provider's designation of a default remedy, <em data-original="E-03">see</em> comment 33(c)-4, where that default is to resend a transfer.  Accordingly, the Bureau is revising comments 33(c)-3 and -4. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As to comment 33(c)-3 in the 2012 Final Rule, which explains how a sender designates a preferred remedy insofar as the revisions to § 1005.33(c)(2) will no longer allow a sender to designate a remedy (or will nullify a designation of a resend remedy prior to the conclusion of an investigation) when an error occurs because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information, the portion of the comment discussing advance designation of a remedy is revised in the 2013 Final Rule.  Comment 33(c)-3 now states, like the 2012 Final Rule, that the provider may also request that the sender indicate the preferred remedy at the time the sender provides notice of the error.  However, as finalized, the comment states that if the provider does so, it should indicate that if the sender chooses a resend at that time, the remedy may be unavailable if the error occurred because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information.  This will prevent senders from being confused as to why they did not receive their requested remedy.  However, if the sender does not indicate the desired remedy at the time of providing notice of error, the provider must notify the sender of any available remedies in the report provided under § 1005.33(c)(1) or (d)(1) if the provider determines an error occurred. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Similarly, the Bureau is revising comment 33(c)-4 to explain that a remittance transfer provider's default remedy is overridden by the requirements of § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii), which sets forth a specific remedy that applies when an error occurs because a sender provides incorrect or insufficient information.  The Bureau is also making conforming changes to comment 33(c)-5 to reflect the renumbering in § 1005.33(c)(2). </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, in light of the changes described above to § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii), the Bureau is adopting new comment 33(c)-12, which provides guidance on how a remittance transfer provider should determine the amount to refund to the sender, or to apply to a new transfer, pursuant to § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii).  Comment 33(c)-12 explains that although § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) permits the provider to deduct from the amount refunded, or applied towards a new transfer, any fees or taxes actually deducted from the transfer amount by a person other than the provider as part of the first unsuccessful remittance transfer attempt or that were deducted in the course of returning the transfer amount to the provider following a failed delivery.  However, a provider may not deduct those fees and taxes that will ultimately be refunded to the provider.  When the provider deducts fees or taxes from the amount refunded pursuant to § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii), the provider must inform the sender of the deduction as part of the notice required by either § 1005.33(c)(1) or (d)(1) and the reason for the deduction.  Comment 33(c)-12 also contains several illustrative examples. </analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(b)(2)(vi) Customer Service Fees</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">6</em>) would have required disclosure on the short form of any fee for calling the financial institution or its service provider, including an interactive voice response system, about a consumer's prepaid accounts using the term “Customer service fee” or a substantially similar term. The Bureau believed that many consumers regularly have issues with their prepaid accounts that require talking to a customer service agent by telephone. The Bureau also believed that some providers impose fees for making such a call. Additionally, several participants in the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing reported having incurred such customer service fees. For these reasons, the Bureau believed that the short form disclosure should include this fee, and thus proposed to include it. The Bureau noted that this disclosure would have been required even if the financial institution did not charge such a fee pursuant to proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)-1.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>No commenters opposed inclusion of customer service fees in the short form disclosure. Instead of disclosing the single highest customer service fee, an issuing bank and several consumer groups recommended disclosing either the fee for both live agent and interactive voice response (IVR) customer service or just the IVR fee. They said otherwise customers may be misled into thinking the disclosed fee includes the cost of a call to an IVR customer service, which generally is free. An office of a State Attorney General recommended that the Bureau ban customer service fees for payroll card accounts because such fees chill inquiry into fraudulent or erroneous charges, but it otherwise supported the disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">6</em>), renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(2)(vi), with certain modifications as described below. The Bureau continues to believe that it is important to require disclosure of this fee because consumers regularly have issues or questions that require contact with the financial institution's customer service department, but the fee is not so common as to merit disclosure in the top line of the short form.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting the final rule with a notable change from the proposal. The Bureau agrees with commenters that it is beneficial for consumers to specifically be alerted to the generally free or less expensive IVR method of customer service, and thus is finalizing § 1005.18(b)(2)(vi) requiring disclosure in the short form of fees for both automated and live agent customer service. The Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing revealed that, consistent with several commenters' observations, disclosure of a general customer service fee resulted in many participants incorrectly assuming the fee would remain the same whether the service was live or automated, while all participants understood the distinction when both automated and live agent customer service fees were disclosed.<footnote ref="392">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report II at 12-13.</footnote>
             Similarly, when a short form disclosed a fee for “live customer service,” all participants understood that the fee would apply if they spoke to a live customer service agent and that the fee would not be charged if they used the automated customer service system to get information about their accounts.<footnote ref="393">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt; at 23.</footnote>
             However, because the structure of the multiple service plan short form permitted pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) does not have sufficient room to disclose both automated and live customer service fees on separate lines, final § 1005.18(b)(2)(vi) states that a financial institution using the multiple service plan short form pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) must disclose only the fee for live customer service. The Bureau believes that disclosing the live customer service fee is preferable to disclosing the automated fee because of the potential cost to the consumer, as the Bureau understands that automated customer service is typically provided at no cost to the consumer. Finally, the Bureau has made other technical modifications to this provision for clarity. Regarding the request that the Bureau ban customer service fees for payroll card accounts, such a request is outside the scope of this rulemaking.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>31(c)(4) Segregation</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(c)(4) provided that written and electronic disclosures required by subpart B must be segregated from everything else and contain only information that is directly related to the disclosures required under subpart B. Proposed comment 31(c)(4)-1 clarified how a remittance transfer provider could segregate disclosures. Proposed comment 31(c)(4)-2 identified information that would be considered directly related to the required disclosures, for purposes of determining what information must be segregated from the required disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed the segregation of required disclosures from other information to avoid overloading the sender with information that could distract from the required disclosures. In permitting directly related information to be included with the required disclosures, the Board recognized that certain information not required by the statute or regulation could be integral to the transaction. The Board stated that remittance transfer providers should be able to communicate this information, such as the confirmation code that a designated recipient must provide in order to receive the funds, to a sender. The Board requested comment on the proposed segregation requirement and whether additional information should be permitted to be included with the required segregated disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters requested further guidance on the segregation requirement, including clarification regarding how disclosures presented on a computer screen could be segregated, and whether disclosures would be considered segregated in a variety of mailing scenarios, including when disclosures are mailed on or with a periodic statement. The Bureau believes proposed comment 31(c)(4)-1 provides sufficient guidance to enable providers to determine whether the disclosures are segregated in a variety of scenarios. For example, the comment requires segregated disclosures to be set off from other information, such as disclosures required by states, but does not require the information to be displayed on a separate sheet of paper. The comment also explains that disclosures may be set off from other information on a notice by outlining them in a box or series of boxes, with bold print dividing lines or a different color background, or by using other means. A provider could apply this guidance to develop, for example, segregated disclosures set off in a box on a periodic statement or set off with a different color background on a computer screen. Therefore, the Bureau is finalizing comment 31(c)(4)-1 substantially as proposed, but adds another example for clarity.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters also suggested that certain additional information should be deemed “directly related” to the required disclosures, such that it would not have to be segregated from the required disclosures. Suggested additions included information regarding the retrieval of funds, such as the number of days the funds will be available to the recipient before the funds are returned to the sender, and a statement that a provider makes money from foreign currency exchange. The Bureau agrees that this information is directly related to the required disclosures and need not be segregated from them. Therefore, the Bureau is adding these to the list of “directly related” items in comment 31(c)(4)-2.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting the segregation requirement substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(c)(4), with revisions to address the applicability of the requirement to mobile applications and text messages and revisions to better clarify that only disclosures provided in writing or electronically must be segregated. Section 1005.31(c)(4) states that except for disclosures provided via mobile application or text message, to the extent permitted by § 1005.31(a)(5), disclosures required by subpart B that are provided in writing or electronically must be segregated from everything else and must contain only information that is directly related to the disclosures required under subpart B. Comment 31(c)(4)-1 of the final rule clarifies that disclosures may be segregated from other information in a variety of ways. For example, the disclosures may appear on a separate sheet of paper or may be set off from other information on a notice by outlining them in a box or series of boxes, with bold print dividing lines or a different color background, or by using other means.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(c)(4)-2 in the final rule clarifies that, for purposes of § 1005.31(c)(4), the following is directly related information: (i) The date and time of the transaction; (ii) the sender's name and contact information; (iii) the location at which the designated recipient may pick up the funds; (iv) the confirmation or other identification code; (v) a company name and logo; (vi) an indication that a disclosure is or is not a receipt or other indicia of proof of payment; (vii) a designated area for signatures or initials; (viii) a statement that funds may be available sooner, as permitted by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii); (ix) instructions regarding the retrieval of funds, such as the number of days the funds will be available to the recipient before they are returned to the sender; and (x) a statement that the provider makes money from foreign currency exchange.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>2(b)(3)(i)(A)</title>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the proposed rule would have created a broad general definition of prepaid account that hinged in significant part on how the account could be loaded and used, as set forth in proposed § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(A) through (C). Rather than relying on a single broad umbrella definition, the Bureau has concluded in response to commenters' concerns about ambiguity as to the scope of coverage that it would provide greater clarity to specify several types of products that are included within the general definition of prepaid account, and then specify an additional, narrower category for the balance of covered products by reference to those products' functionality. Accordingly, the final rule has been reorganized to list the specific categories of products first. The reorganization is not intended to substantively alter the scope of the proposed prepaid account definition's coverage.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(A) defines the first such category, payroll card accounts. As discussed above, Regulation E currently contains provisions specific to payroll card accounts and defines such accounts.<footnote ref="298">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; existing § 1005.2(b)(2).</footnote>
             Insofar as the Bureau was generally proposing to adapt existing payroll card account rules to prepaid accounts in § 1005.18 (which currently addresses only payroll card accounts), payroll card accounts would have been subsumed within the broad general definition of prepaid account. Nevertheless, the Bureau believed that because there are certain provisions of Regulation E that would remain specific to payroll card accounts, it was appropriate to propose to maintain the term payroll card account as a standalone sub-definition of prepaid account. Specifically, proposed § 1005.2(b)(3)(ii) would have provided that the term “prepaid account” included a “payroll card account,” and would have restated the existing payroll card account definition.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau proposed to renumber existing comment 2(b)-2, which concerns certain employment-related cards not covered as payroll card accounts, as comment 2(b)(3)(ii)-1. The Bureau proposed to add to comment 2(b)(3)(ii)-1 an explanation that would have clarified that, while the existing examples given of cards would not be payroll card accounts (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> cards used solely to disburse incentive-based payments, such as bonuses, disbursements unrelated to compensation, and cards used in isolated instances to which an employer typically does not make recurring payments, such as when providing final payments or in emergency situations where other payment methods are unavailable), such cards could constitute prepaid accounts generally, provided the other conditions of the definition of that term in proposed § 1005.2(b)(3) were satisfied. Similar to existing comment 2(b)-2, proposed comment 2(b)(3)(ii)-1 would have also stated that all transactions involving the transfer of funds to or from a payroll card account or prepaid account were covered by the regulation, even if a particular transaction involved payment of a bonus, other incentive-based payment, or reimbursement, or the transaction did not represent a transfer of wages, salary, or other employee compensation.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive any comments on this portion of the proposal, and as such, is finalizing the regulatory text and commentary largely as proposed, with minor modifications in the commentary for clarity and consistency with terms used elsewhere in this final rule.<footnote ref="299">The Bureau received several comments from industry requesting that the Bureau maintain a separate section for payroll card accounts, rather than treat payroll card accounts in § 1005.18, which, as the Bureau proposed, will become the general prepaid account section. Those comments, and the Bureau's response to them, are summarized in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(a) below.</footnote>
             To accommodate several substantive changes to the definition of prepaid account, however, the Bureau has renumbered several sub-sections of § 1005.2(b)(3), including § 1005.2(b)(3)(ii) and its related commentary. Under the new numbering scheme, proposed § 1005.2(b)(3)(ii) is now final § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(A) and proposed comment 2(b)(3)(ii)-1 is accordingly renumbered as comment 2(b)(3)(i)-2.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>30(f) Remittance Transfer Provider</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.30(e) incorporated the definition of “remittance transfer provider” from EFTA section 919(g)(3). Proposed § 205.30(e) stated that a remittance transfer provider (or provider) means any person that provides remittance transfers for a consumer in the normal course of its business, regardless of whether the consumer holds an account with such person. To eliminate redundancy, the proposed rule revised statutory references to “any person or financial institution” to “any person,” because the term “person” under Regulation E includes financial institutions. Proposed comment 30(e)-1 clarified that an agent is not deemed to be a remittance transfer provider by merely providing remittance transfer services on behalf of the remittance transfer provider. The proposed regulation is adopted generally as proposed in renumbered § 1005.30(f). Comment 30(f)-1 is revised for clarity to state that a person is not deemed to be acting as a remittance transfer provider when it performs activities as an agent on behalf of a remittance transfer provider. New comments 30(f)-2 and -3 are added as described below. The Bureau notes that this comment 30(f)-1 applies only for purposes of this rule. In other contexts, a person may act as a provider when it performs activities on behalf of a provider.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Normal Course of Business</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Board solicited comment on whether guidance should be adopted interpreting the phrase “normal course of business” based on the number of remittance transfers in a given year. Many industry commenters argued that the final rule should provide for a <em data-original="E-03">de minimis</em> exception based on the number of remittance transfers sent in a given time period, although one credit union commenter stated that it could be difficult to track numbers. Suggestions ranged from 1,200 or fewer transfers annually to 2,400 transfers annually, per method (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> 2,400 wire transfers plus 2,400 international ACH transfers).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The commenters did not provide any data on the overall distribution and frequency of remittance transfers across various providers to support treating such high numbers of transactions as being outside the normal course of business. Nor did they suggest other means of determining when remittance transfer providers are engaging in transfers merely as an accommodation to occasional consumer requests rather than part of a business of payment services. Absent significant additional information, the Bureau is skeptical that Congress intended to exclude companies averaging 100 or more remittance transfer providers per month from the statutory scheme. Based on the data presented by commenters, such a range would appear to exclude the majority of providers of open network transfers, such as international wire transfers and ACH transactions, from the rule. For example, one trade association commenter stated that most respondents to an information request said that they make fewer than 2,400 international transactions per year. As discussed above, the Bureau believes that the statute clearly covers open network transfers, such as wire transfers and ACH transactions. Providing an exception based on the ranges suggested by these commenters would allow many financial institutions that arguably regularly and in the normal course of business provide remittance transfers to not be subject to the regulation. The Bureau believes in general that the term “normal course of business” covers remittance transfer activities at a level significantly lower than the ranges suggested by these commenters.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In other contexts, regulatory coverage is triggered by a relatively small number of transactions. For example, under Regulation Z, 12 CFR part 1026, a creditor is a person who regularly extends consumer credit under specified circumstances. A person regularly extends consumer credit when it extends consumer credit more than 25 times in the preceding calendar year or in the current year (and five times for transactions secured by a dwelling, or even one time for certain high-cost mortgages).<footnote ref="73">The Bureau notes that it has issued a separate notice of request for information in which the Bureau requests comment on whether it should revise these threshold numbers in Regulation Z. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 76 FR 75825 (Dec. 5, 2011).</footnote>
            <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 12 CFR 1026.2(a)(17). Under State law, a single money transmission may trigger a requirement to register as a money transmitter.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe it has sufficient information on the frequency with which entities engage in remittance transfers to set a specific numerical threshold based on the current administrative record. Accordingly, the final rule adopts a new comment 30(f)-2 addressing “normal course of business.” Comment 30(f)-2 states that whether a person provides remittance transfers in the normal course of business depends on the facts and circumstances, including the total number and frequency of remittance transfers sent by the provider. For example, if a financial institution generally does not make international consumer wire transfers available to customers, but sends a couple of international consumer wire transfers in a given year as an accommodation for a customer, the institution does not provide remittance transfers in the normal course of business. In contrast, if a financial institution makes international consumer wire transfers generally available to customers (whether described in the institution's deposit account agreement, or in practice) and makes transfers multiple times per month, the institution provides remittance transfers in the normal course of business.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>While the final comment does not include a numerical threshold for “normal course of business,” the Bureau recognizes that a bright-line number may ease compliance. Thus, in the January 2012 Proposed Rule, published elsewhere in the <em data-original="E-04">Federal Register</em> today, the Bureau is soliciting further comment on a potential safe harbor threshold.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Multiple Remittance Transfer Providers</title>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 30(f)-3 provides guidance where more than one remittance transfer provider is involved in providing a remittance transfer. The Bureau recognizes that in some situations more than one remittance transfer provider may be involved in providing a remittance transfer. For example, prepaid card programs may involve, among others: (i) A program sponsor that establishes the program relationships, identifies and procures the necessary parties and sets contractual terms and conditions; (ii) a program manager which functions as a day-to-day operations “control center” for the program; and (iii) an issuing bank whose contractual involvement is required to invoke the payment network and which also may serve as the holder of funds that have been prepaid and are awaiting instructions to be disbursed. Any and all of these entities may be a “remittance transfer provider” if they meet the definition as set forth in § 1005.30(f).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 30(f)-3 provides that if the remittance transfer involves more than one remittance transfer provider, only one set of disclosures must be given, and the remittance transfer providers must agree among themselves which provider must take the actions necessary to comply with the requirements that subpart B imposes on any or all of them. Even though the providers must designate one provider to take the actions necessary to comply with the requirements that subpart B imposes on any or all of them, all remittance transfer providers involved in the remittance transfer remain responsible for compliance with the applicable provisions of the EFTA and Regulation E.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>30(f) Definition of Remittance Transfer Provider</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Overview</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.30(f) of the February Final Rule and the accompanying commentary implement the definition of the term “remittance transfer provider” in EFTA section 919(g)(3). Section 1005.30(f) states that a “remittance transfer provider” means any person that provides remittance transfers for a consumer in the normal course of its business, regardless of whether the consumer holds an account with such person. A remittance transfer provider is required to comply with subpart B of Regulation E relating to remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As adopted in the February Final Rule, comment 30(f)-2 provides guidance interpreting the phrase “normal course of business” as used in the definition of remittance transfer provider. Specifically, comment 30(f)-2 to the February Final Rule states that whether a person provides remittance transfers in the normal course of business depends on the facts and circumstances, including the total number and frequency of remittance transfers sent by the provider. Comment 30(f)-2 also sets forth illustrative examples.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>To provide clearer guidance on whether a person provides remittance transfers in the normal course of business, the Bureau proposed to add to comment 30(f)-2 an express safe harbor further interpreting the phrase “normal course of business.” The proposed safe harbor was based on the number of remittance transfers that a person provides. Proposed comment 30(f)-2 stated that if a person provided no more than 25 remittance transfers in the previous calendar year, the person does not provide remittance transfers in the normal course of business for the current calendar year if it provides no more than 25 remittance transfers in that year. The proposed comment clarified, however, that if that person makes a 26th remittance transfer in the current calendar year, the person would be evaluated under the facts and circumstances test to determine whether the person is a remittance transfer provider for that transfer and any other transfers provided through the rest of the year.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau solicited comment on the proposal to adopt a safe harbor interpreting the term “normal course of business.” The Bureau also specifically solicited comment on whether, if such a safe harbor is appropriate, the threshold number should be higher or lower than 25 remittance transfers, such as 10 or 50 transfers, or some other number.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Commenters generally supported or did not oppose clarifying the meaning of “normal course of business” with a safe harbor. Consumer group commenters supported the proposed threshold of 25 transfers per year. Some industry commenters proposed that any safe harbor be based on criteria other than or in addition to the number of transfers provided per year. Furthermore, most industry commenters argued that if the Bureau adopts a safe harbor based on the number of remittance transfers provided per year, that the Bureau should use a threshold number that is higher (and in some cases significantly higher) than 25 transfers per year. Finally, some commenters suggested changes in how any safe harbor would be implemented, such as that the Bureau should provide time for an entity to come into compliance if the person becomes a remittance transfer provider once the safe harbor threshold is exceeded. These comments are discussed in more detail below.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Regulatory Text</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters suggested that if the Bureau adopted a safe harbor related to the term “normal course of business,” that the safe harbor be included in the text of subpart B to Regulation E rather than in the commentary to the rule in order to help consumers understand when the protections in subpart B of Regulation E will apply to their transactions. Upon further consideration, the Bureau believes that, for clarity, it is appropriate to include the safe harbor regarding the phrase “normal course of business” in the text of subpart B of Regulation E. Consequently, the Bureau redesignates former § 1005.30(f) as § 1005.30(f)(1), and adopts § 1005.30(f)(2)(i), which creates the new safe harbor described below. New § 1005.30(f)(2)(ii) also creates a new transition period, described below. Revised comment 30(f)-2 provides interpretive guidance and illustrative examples.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Facts and Circumstances</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 30(f)-2 to the February Final Rule states that whether a person provides remittance transfers in the normal course of business depends on the facts and circumstances, including the total number and frequency of remittance transfers sent by the provider. The Bureau did not propose any modification to this guidance. However, one consumer group commenter suggested a rewording of the proposed safe harbor that would mean that any person who does not qualify for the safe harbor should be subject to the requirements of subpart B of Regulation E, regardless of the facts and circumstances. Furthermore, some commenters appeared to misunderstand the relevance of the Bureau's guidance in proposed comment 30(f)-2 regarding persons that do not qualify for the safe harbor.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 30(f)-2 to the February Final Rule is renumbered and adopted with several non-substantive edits for clarity, and one minor modification, as comment 30(f)-2.i to the final rule. The modification is necessary because as discussed below, the final rule adopts a safe harbor similar to the safe harbor in proposed comment 30(f)-2, but, among other things, increases the threshold for that safe harbor from 25 to 100 remittance transfers per calendar year. For conformity, the Bureau has changed its guidance regarding a person that provides remittance transfers in the normal course of business. Final comment 30(f)-2.i interprets the phrase “normal course of business” to include a financial institution that makes remittance transfers generally available to customers and makes such transfers “many” times per month. Comment 30(f)-2 in the February Final Rule uses the term “multiple” rather than “many.” The Bureau believes that the term “many” is more consistent with the language and approach in the safe harbor as adopted.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>A Safe Harbor Based on the Number of Remittance Transfers Provided</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Though most commenters did not oppose a safe harbor based on the number of remittance transfers provided, several industry commenters urged the Bureau to create a safe harbor based on other criteria. Some industry commenters suggested that a safe harbor be based on qualitative criteria, such as whether or not persons hold themselves out to be remittance transfer providers. Alternatively, some industry commenters suggested that the safe harbor apply to some or all financial institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, and other industry commenters suggested that the Bureau look to measures of the relative size of a person's remittance transfer business, such as the percent of a person's total transactions that are remittance transfers, or the percent of a person's revenue or net income that is earned from such transfers. Some industry commenters suggested the Bureau define a safe harbor based on these relative size measures alone, while others suggested that the relative size measures should apply only to certain entities or business models, or that entities should qualify for the safe harbor if they satisfy either of two alternative thresholds, such as the number of remittance transfers provided and a relative size measure. For example, one industry commenter suggested a safe harbor that would exclude from coverage of subpart B of Regulation E credit unions that (a) rely on unrelated third parties to send remittance transfers, and do not provide remittance transfers as their primary business, as long as (b) such transfers account for 30 percent or less of the credit unions' total revenues. In general, commenters suggesting relative size thresholds supported such measures because they would take into account the size of a person's overall business, or because the number of remittance transfers that a person provides may vary from year to year.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The final rule adds a safe harbor, which is described in new § 1005.30(f)(2)(i). The safe harbor in the final rule reflects several modifications to the proposed commentary included in the February Proposal, as well as several non-substantive edits for clarity. Similar to the proposed comment, the safe harbor in § 1005.30(f)(2)(i) is based on a single bright line threshold, the number of remittance transfers a person provides. It states that a person is deemed not to be providing remittance transfers for a consumer in the normal course of its business if the person provided 100 or fewer remittance transfers in the previous calendar year and provides 100 or fewer remittance transfers in the current calendar year. Comment 30(f)-2.ii provides additional clarification. It states that a person that qualifies for the safe harbor in § 1005.30(f)(2)(i) is not a remittance transfer provider, and is thus not subject to the requirements of subpart B of Regulation E. The comment also clarifies that for the purposes of determining whether a person qualifies for the safe harbor, the number of remittance transfers provided includes any transfers that are excluded from the definition of “remittance transfer” due simply to this safe harbor. In contrast, the number of remittance transfers provided in a calendar year does not include any transfers that are excluded from the definition of “remittance transfer” for reasons other than the safe harbor, such as the small value transactions and securities and commodities transfers that are excluded from the definition of “remittance transfer” by § 1005.30(e)(2).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As stated in the February Proposal, 77 FR 6310, 6314-15, the Bureau believes that a safe harbor can reduce compliance burden by increasing legal certainty in the market. Without a safe harbor, some persons who currently provide remittance transfers, or are contemplating doing so, may face uncertainty and litigation risk as to whether they meet the definition of “remittance transfer provider” when they provide a small number of transfers in a given year. Increased legal certainty may encourage some such persons to continue providing remittance transfers, when they might not otherwise be inclined to offer such products, due to concerns about legal uncertainty or the cost of compliance with subpart B of Regulation E.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>However, the Bureau also recognizes that a safe harbor interpreting the phrase “normal course of business” can limit the protections afforded to some consumers. The adoption of a numerical safe harbor may result in consumers not receiving the disclosures, error resolution, and other protections required by this rule in some instances in which they might otherwise, because these consumers may be customers of persons who qualify for the safe harbor and, therefore, will have certainty that they are not “remittance transfer providers” for purposes of subpart B of Regulation E.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Based on these considerations, the Bureau believes that the safe harbor should be derived from the phrase “normal course of business,” should provide substantial certainty to potential providers, and should be limited in scope so as to preserve the benefits of the statutory protections as intended by Congress. The Bureau believes that a safe harbor will provide the most certainty if it is based on a bright-line measure that permits persons to identify easily whether or not they qualify.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau continues to believe that the provision of only a small number of remittance transfers per year is a reasonable basis for identifying persons that do not provide remittance transfers in the normal course of business. As explained in the February Proposal, 77 FR 6310, 6315, the Bureau believes that the inclusion of the phrase “normal course of business” in the statutory definition of “remittance transfer provider” was meant to exclude persons that provide remittance transfers on a limited basis. As a result, the fact that a person provides only a small number of remittance transfers can strongly indicate that the person is not providing such transfers in the normal course of its business. Furthermore, the number of transfers provided is an objective standard that is easy to apply and should provide substantial certainty to persons regarding whether or not they qualify for the safe harbor.<footnote ref="5">As one industry commenter suggested, given the potential for seasonal variation in the demand for remittance transfers, the Bureau believes that an annual figure is the most appropriate for the safe harbor threshold.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe that it is appropriate, based on the current administrative record, to define a safe harbor based on asset size or a relative size measure such as percentage of revenue. Commenters did not provide, and the Bureau does not have, data suggesting, across the remittance transfer industry, why any of the specific asset size or relative size thresholds suggested by the comments would be an appropriate basis for defining normal course of business. Moreover, the Bureau is concerned that there may not be a measure of entity size that is currently used by all segments of the remittance transfer industry. While some providers, such as banks and credit unions, tend to measure their size in assets, in other segments of the remittance transfer market, revenues or some other aspect of a business may be a more widely used measure.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Additionally, the Bureau believes that due to the wide variety of business models for offering remittance transfers and lack of currently available data, it would be difficult to craft a single standalone measure of relative size for identifying persons who provide remittance transfers on only a limited basis. For example, a standalone revenue threshold might exclude from the rule's coverage both a person who makes few transfers, but at a high price, and a person who offers many more transfers for free or at a very low price, as a value-added service to its customers. The Bureau is concerned that many persons who fall into the latter category may, in fact, make remittance transfers generally available to customers and make many transfers each month.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also believes that a safe harbor based on qualitative criteria could require fact-intensive determinations, and thus, unlike a bright-line threshold, would provide little additional clarity to the market. For instance, a safe harbor based on whether a person “holds itself out” as a remittance transfer provider would require context-specific evaluation similar to the evaluation of whether a person provides remittance transfers in the normal course of business based on the facts and circumstances, in accordance with the guidance in final comment 30(f)-2.i. Thus, such a safe harbor would not accomplish the goals of the February Proposal.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Size of Numerical Threshold</title>
        <analysisParagraph>In proposing comment 30(f)-2, the Bureau suggested 25 transfers as a potential threshold, noting that the number would be consistent with the general threshold for coverage under the Bureau's Regulation Z, 12 CFR part 1026, which relates to credit transactions. Under Regulation Z, a creditor is defined as an entity that regularly extends consumer credit under specified circumstances. Generally, under Regulation Z, a person regularly extends consumer credit in the current calendar year when it either extended consumer credit more than 25 times in the preceding calendar year or more than 25 times in the current calendar year.<footnote ref="6">Regulation Z in some cases provides additional protections for credit secured by a dwelling and certain high cost mortgages. For example, with respect to whether a person is a creditor, a person regularly extends consumer credit in the current calendar year if it either extended consumer credit for transactions secured by a dwelling more than five times in the previous calendar year or more than five times in the current calendar year. In addition, a person regularly extends consumer credit if it extends consumer credit for just one high-cost mortgage in a 12-month period. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 12 CFR 1026.2(a)(17).</footnote>
            <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1026.2(a)(17) and comment 2(a)(17)(i)-4.<footnote ref="7">The Bureau notes that it has issued a separate notice of request for information on whether it should revise these threshold numbers in Regulation Z. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 76 FR 75825, Dec. 5, 2011.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received a number of comments regarding the appropriate threshold on which to base any safe harbor regarding the definition of “normal course of business.” Consumer group commenters supported the proposed threshold of 25 remittance transfers provided per year. In contrast, most industry commenters suggested a range of higher thresholds. For example, some commenters suggested thresholds based on annual transfer volumes ranging from 50 to 5,000 remittance transfers, or 1,000 remittance transfers per method of transfer. Other commenters suggested thresholds of 75 remittance transfers per month, 25 remittance transfers per day, or other figures. State banking regulators did not suggest a specific threshold, but maintained that the Bureau should base the threshold on data received regarding the number of remittance transfers sent by depository institutions with under $10 billion in assets. These regulators also suggested that the Bureau adopt a threshold for depository institutions that is higher than the threshold for other entities.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Many of the commenters that explained why they believed a higher threshold was appropriate focused on the cost of compliance with subpart B of Regulation E. Both in commenting on the proposed “normal course of business” safe harbor, and more generally, depository institutions, credit unions, and trade associations of depository institutions and credit unions described challenges associated with complying with the February Final Rule. These industry commenters stated that for open network transfers in particular,<footnote ref="8">Depository institutions and credit unions have traditionally offered consumers remittance transfers by way of wire transfers, which are generally open network transactions. In an open network, no single provider has control over, or relationships with, all of the participants that may collect funds in the United States or disburse funds abroad. A number of principal providers may access the system. National laws, individual contracts, and the rules of various messaging, settlement, or payment systems may constrain certain parts of transfers sent through an open network system. However, any participant may use the network to send transfers to unaffiliated institutions abroad with which it has no contractual relationship, and over which it has limited authority or ability to monitor or control. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 77 FR 6194, 6195-97.</footnote>
             the requirements to estimate or disclose third-party fees and exchange rates, to disclose a transfer's date of availability, and to refund transfers in certain circumstances would be impossible, challenging, risky, or costly to implement. Based on these and related concerns, industry commenters who were focused on the concerns of depository institutions and credit unions generally argued that a threshold higher than 25 was necessary in order to relieve more persons from compliance, to encourage greater continued market participation after subpart B of Regulation E takes effect, or to promote the ability of smaller depository institutions to compete with other providers. A number of industry commenters stated that they expected that some (or many) individual depository institutions and credit unions would limit the number of remittance transfers provided in order to qualify for any safe harbor, or would exit the market for remittance transfers, in order to avoid compliance with subpart B of Regulation E.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Alternatively, some industry commenters urged the Bureau to increase the size of the threshold based on what they described as typical practice among banks. For example, one commenter stated that a typical bank could reach 25 remittance transfers within the first few weeks of a year. It suggested a threshold of 300 remittance transfers per year because, it contended, that figure better represents the number of such transfers that a small institution provides, is still small enough that the excepted transactions would not generate a material source of income for a financial institution, and amounts to, on average, less than one transfer for every 25 accountholders for small banks. That commenter and other industry commenters stated that many or most depository institutions or credit unions are not “in the business” of providing remittance transfers, do not advertise the service, or generally offer remittance transfers only upon request.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters offered other rationales to support thresholds higher than 25 remittance transfers per year. Some industry commenters stated that a threshold of 25 would not be useful because of the complexity of preparing for compliance if the threshold is crossed. One industry commenter advocated for a threshold of 50 remittance transfers, because that figure would constitute approximately one remittance transfer per week. Suggesting a threshold of 75 remittance transfers per year, another industry commenter argued that Regulation Z was an inappropriate reference point for subpart B of Regulation E because financial institutions tend to provide far more fund transfers per year than they do loans. Another industry commenter contended that a threshold of 600 remittance transfers per year was better to exclude institutions that provide remittance transfers infrequently and in response to specific consumer requests.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters also suggested that the Bureau commit to reevaluating the threshold on which the safe harbor is based. One industry commenter suggested that the Bureau revisit the safe harbor threshold nine months after the effective date of subpart B of Regulation E to determine whether further adjustment is appropriate. Similarly, another industry commenter suggested that the Bureau annually adjust the safe harbor threshold.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The safe harbor described in § 1005.30(f)(2)(i) of the final rule establishes a threshold of 100 remittance transfers per calendar year. The Bureau believes that it is reasonable to set a higher transaction threshold for determining when remittance transfers are provided “in the normal course of business” than for determining when a person “regularly extends” consumer credit under Regulation Z. There are several reasons why remittance transfers are different from extensions of credit. A single extension of credit typically involves an ongoing relationship between a consumer and creditor that may extend over weeks, months, or years. Credit is often provided as a standalone financial product in its own right, and can generate significant per-transaction revenues over time. A remittance transfer, on the other hand, is a one-time transaction, for which the provider generally collects a one-time set of fees. Revenues per transaction are often relatively low; additionally, remittance transfers are sometimes provided as an adjunct to other financial products (such as a long-term account relationship). As a result, a single extension of credit may be more significant to a business than a single remittance transfer would be to the business of a person that provides such transfers. Furthermore, a single extension of credit may meet the demand of a consumer with ongoing credit needs; on the other hand, multiple remittance transfers may be needed to satisfy the annual demand of a consumer with ongoing transaction needs. Similarly, the Bureau believes that because it is not uncommon for consumers who send money abroad to do so 12 or more times per year,<footnote ref="9">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; Bendixen Amandi, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Survey of Latin American Immigrants in the United States&lt;/em&gt; 22 (Apr. 30, 2008), available at: &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://bendixenandamandi.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/IDB_2008_National_Survey_Presentation.pdf.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
             a change in the demand of just one or two customers might result in significant variance in the number of remittance transfers provided by a person who sends only a small number of transfers. The Bureau believes the same is less likely to be true of extensions of credit.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that a figure of 100 or fewer transfers per year appropriately accounts for the differences between remittance transfers and extensions of credit. It is high enough that persons will not risk exceeding the safe harbor based on the needs of just two or three customers seeking monthly transfers. At the same time, the Bureau believes that a threshold of 100 is low enough to serve as a reasonable basis for identifying persons who occasionally provide remittance transfers, but not in the normal course of their business. One hundred transfers per year is equivalent to an average of approximately two remittance transfers per week, or the number of remittance transfers needed to satisfy the needs of a handful of customers sending money abroad monthly.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Though industry commenters suggested a number of thresholds higher than 100 remittance transfers per year, the Bureau is concerned that a person who provides more than 100 transfers in a calendar year is more likely than other persons to be providing remittance transfers in the normal course of its business, such as by making transfers generally available to its customers, and by providing them more frequently. Furthermore, the Bureau does not have industry-wide information linking commenters' suggested higher thresholds either to the definition of “normal course of business,” or to other factors that commenters suggested were relevant, such as the cost of compliance with subpart B of Regulation E.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters provided little data to support their contentions that any particular threshold was the most appropriate. Two trade associations provided high-level summaries of limited surveys of member banks regarding the number of international funds transfers sent. Otherwise, the comments received in response to the February Proposal generally did not provide data on the overall distribution and frequency of remittance transfers across providers to support treating any particular number of transactions as outside the normal course of business.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Through additional outreach, the Bureau obtained limited data from several sources regarding the number of remittances transfers and similar transactions provided by individual depository institutions and credit unions, money transmitters, and other small businesses that may also send money abroad. The Bureau hoped that such information might enable the Bureau to better evaluate the comments received, and reveal patterns in the numbers of transfers sent by different types of providers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The data received include results from several limited surveys of depository institutions and/or credit unions regarding the number of remittance transfers that they send; estimates of the number of consumer-initiated outbound international wire transfers conducted by individual banks and/or credit unions provided through one correspondent bank or a corporate credit union; the number of remittances and other transactions conducted by state-licensed money transmitters in California, New York, and Ohio; and estimates of the number of outbound international transfers provided by individual credit unions using a specialized service. The Bureau also discussed with an industry expert the characteristics of several types of small businesses other than depository institutions and credit unions that may send money abroad, including start-up enterprises and small businesses that send money abroad that are not registered or licensed as money transmitters.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe that it can extrapolate from any of the data sets received to the remittance transfer market as a whole or any segment of it, due to factors including the small sample sizes and the Bureau's inability to determine whether the institutions covered in any data set are representative of the market as a whole or any segment of it. Also, regarding some segments of the market, the Bureau did not receive any data. Furthermore, in some cases, the data received may overestimate or underestimate the number of remittance transfers provided. For example, the data sets from a correspondent bank and a corporate credit union may underestimate the number of transactions provided by individual institutions, as these data sets reflect only wire transfers sent through either that correspondent bank or corporate credit union, and the institutions covered by the data sets may use other such intermediary institutions, or send remittance transfers by means other than wire. By contrast, the three states' transaction data both underestimate and overestimate the number of remittance transfers sent. On the one hand, one state provided data regarding transactions only from that state to foreign countries, rather than all international transfers that the state-licensed entities may have sent from the United States. On the other hand, all three states' data mix consumer-initiated outbound international transactions with transactions that are not remittance transfers, as defined in subpart B of Regulation E, including transfers initiated by businesses, domestic transfers, and/or sales of certain payment devices or other state-regulated transactions, depending on the state.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As a result of these limitations, the Bureau does not believe it can rely on the data received to describe the number of remittance transfers provided by “typical” entities or to identify a clear pattern in the distribution of providers by the number of transfers provided. Nor does the data received allow the Bureau to distinguish meaningfully among a number of the more modest thresholds suggested by commenters, in terms of the challenge of compliance for such institutions, or other factors suggested by commenters.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Nevertheless, the Bureau believes the data collected provide some additional support for a safe harbor based on a threshold of 100 remittance transfers per year. Though the data sets regarding state-licensed money transmitters did not show that any of the licensees that recorded some transaction volume also recorded 100 or fewer transactions per year nationally,<footnote ref="10">For transmitters licensed in California, the Bureau does not know whether the number of transactions reported for a company in California is the same as or less than the number of transactions that a company sent nationwide. Because each of the states' data sets combines remittance transfers with domestic transfers, business-initiated transfers, and/or sales of certain payment instruments (depending on the state), the Bureau cannot be certain as to the number of remittance transfers provided by each listed entity. However, the Bureau's review of entity Web sites suggests that many of the licensees that provide international money transfers to consumers focus on that line of business, and thus, that for many of the licensees that provide any remittance transfers, most of the reported transactions are, in fact, remittance transfers.</footnote>
             each of the data sets regarding depository institutions and credit unions suggested that a meaningful portion of the institutions covered by the data set were sending 100 or fewer remittance transfers annually. In other words, the threshold is not so low as to be meaningless. In the data sets for which the Bureau received detailed information, between roughly 40 percent and roughly 90 percent of those responding to or covered by the data who reported any transactions in the most recent year also stated that they provided 100 or fewer such transactions in that year.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As commenters suggested, the Bureau intends to monitor the 100-transfer threshold over time. The Bureau is working to develop better sources of information on the frequency of remittance transfers provided not only by depository institutions, credit unions, and state-licensed money transmitters, but also by other types of entities, particularly broker-dealers and others that may send money abroad but that are not state- or federally-licensed or chartered. The Bureau believes based on available information that many nonbank companies that send money abroad fewer than 100 times per year may be agents for remittance transfer providers that are required to comply with subpart B of Regulation E. However, data about the market for international money transfers remains limited, especially with regard to providers that are not State- or Federally-licensed or chartered. Thus, the Bureau intends to continue seeking better data about the business structures and consumer protection concerns in all segments of the market.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Application of the Safe Harbor</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Commenters raised several questions and suggestions regarding the application of the safe harbor described in proposed comment 30(f)-2. For example, some industry commenters sought clarification that a newly formed entity or a new entrant to the market would be considered to have provided zero remittance transfers in the previous calendar year.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New § 1005.30(f)(2)(i) does not generally distinguish between entities that provided zero remittance transfers in the previous calendar year and those that provided from one to 100. For entities formed during a particular calendar year, the Bureau recognizes that the number of transfers provided during the previous calendar year (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> none), sheds little light on those entities' current or future business practices. However, the Bureau is concerned that an exception to the safe harbor for newly formed entities or new entrants would mean that none of those entities would be able to take advantage of the increased legal certainty that the safe harbor provides to other persons. Furthermore, the Bureau expects that any newly formed entity (or new entrant) that plans to offer remittance transfers in the normal course of its business will develop systems to comply with subpart B of Regulation E from the start, rather than wait until its 101st transfer. The Bureau notes that newly formed entities or new entrants conducting 100 or fewer remittance transfers in their first year in operation likely account for a very small portion of the total volume of remittance transfers sent each year.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters suggested that persons who exceed the safe harbor threshold not be required to come into compliance immediately with subpart B of Regulation E. One industry commenter suggested that providers be given six months to come into compliance with subpart B of Regulation E after exceeding any safe harbor threshold. Another industry commenter suggested that compliance be required only after a person exceeds the threshold for two consecutive years.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In response to the comments received, the Bureau adopts new § 1005.30(f)(2)(ii), which provides a transition period for any person that provided 100 or fewer remittance transfers in the previous calendar year but provides more than 100 remittance transfers in the current calendar year. Upon exceeding the 100-transaction threshold, that person would be subject to greater uncertainty as to whether it is providing remittance transfers in the normal course of business. Section 1005.30(f)(2)(ii) states that if such person is then providing remittance transfers for a consumer in the normal course of its business, then the person may have a reasonable period of time, not to exceed six months, to begin complying with subpart B of Regulation E. Compliance with subpart B will not be required for any remittance transfers for which payment is made during that reasonable period of time.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 30(f)-2.iii offers further explanation and clarification. It states that if a person that provided 100 or fewer remittance transfers in the previous calendar year provides more than 100 such transfers in the current calendar year, the safe harbor described in § 1005.30(f)(2)(i) applies to the first 100 remittance transfers that the person provides in the current calendar year. But similar to proposed comment 30(f)-2, final comment 30(f)-2.iii clarifies that for any additional remittance transfers provided in the current calendar year and for any remittance transfers provided in the subsequent calendar year, whether the person provides remittance transfers for a consumer in the normal course of business, and is thus a remittance transfer provider for those additional transfers, depends on the facts and circumstances. The comment further explains that for such a person, compliance with subpart B of Regulation E will be required at the end of the “reasonable period of time” permitted by § 1005.30(f)(2)(ii) unless, based on the facts and circumstances, such a person is not a remittance transfer provider. Comment 30(f)-2.iv provides an example with specific dates to illustrate application of the safe harbor and transition period.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes it necessary and proper to use its EFTA section 904(a) and (c) authority to adopt the transition period described in new § 1005.30(f)(2)(ii) because the transition period will effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and facilitate compliance. The Bureau expects that a person initiating compliance with subpart B of Regulation E may need some time to adjust business processes and computer systems and train its staff. The Bureau is concerned that absent a transition period, persons who intend to become remittance transfer providers may temporarily suspend service in order to change their systems, and that such temporary suspension could be disruptive to consumers, as well as to the providers. However, the Bureau believes that any transition period should be limited because it will permit some persons to provide remittance transfers in the normal course of business without providing the disclosure, error resolution, and other protections generally required by subpart B of Regulation E. The Bureau believes that six months is an adequate period of time for entities to come into compliance, particularly because the Bureau expects that service providers will emerge or evolve to permit new remittance transfer providers to accelerate compliance. The Bureau expects that persons who are remittance transfer providers will use the transition period permitted by § 1005.30(f)(2)(ii) to take all reasonable steps toward compliance with subpart B of Regulation E.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter stated that it does not have a system in place to count remittance transfers during the year. The Bureau recognizes that prior to the implementation of this rule, many persons likely had no reason to identify remittance transfers. In the future, the Bureau expects that many small providers will accurately track their remittance transfers to know whether they qualify for the safe harbor described in § 1005.30(f)(2). With regard to transfers provided prior to this rule's effective date, the Bureau expects that providers who did not distinguish remittance transfers from other electronic transfers of funds sent to recipients in other countries can use reasonable means to identify what subset of these transfers were remittance transfers, based on available information. For example, a bank might conclude that every outbound international wire transfer initiated by a consumer is a remittance transfer for purposes of determining whether the safe harbor applies in the first year after the effective date.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Other Comments</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters requested that the Bureau clarify that transfers provided by persons that qualify for the “normal course of business” safe harbor are governed by Article 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). Article 4A applies to international funds transfers, but generally provides that it does not apply to a funds transfer any part of which is governed by the EFTA. In the February Final Rule, 77 FR 6194, 6212, the Bureau recognized that one consequence of covering remittance transfers under the EFTA could be legal uncertainty under the UCC for certain remittance transfer providers. The Bureau stated its belief that the best mechanisms for resolving that uncertainty rests with the states that have adopted the UCC, with the purveyors of rules applicable to specific wire systems, which can bind direct participants in the system, and with participants in wire transfers who can incorporate UCC Article 4A into their contracts. Similarly, the Bureau does not believe that the requested clarification is proper, as the Bureau does not implement or administer Article 4A. Furthermore, the Bureau believes that subpart B of Regulation E already makes clear what transactions it governs.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters also suggested that the Bureau require that either just insured institutions or all persons that qualify for the safe harbor described in § 1005.30(f)(2)(i) disclose to consumers that consumer protections applicable to remittance transfers provided by remittance transfer providers will not apply to transactions provided by those persons. The Bureau does not believe it is appropriate to impose such a requirement without seeking notice and comment on it. Furthermore, such a requirement would be in tension with EFTA Section 919, which subpart B implements, and which does not impose any express obligation on persons that are not remittance transfer providers.

        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As noted above, under the Payroll Card Rule, a financial institution is not required to furnish periodic statements pursuant to § 1005.9(b) if it instead follows the periodic statement alternative for payroll card accounts in existing § 1005.18(b)(1). Existing § 1005.18(b)(1)(i) requires a financial institution to provide access to the consumer's account balance through a readily available telephone line. The Bureau proposed to extend this requirement as proposed § 1005.18(c)(1)(i) to all prepaid accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.15(d)(1)(i) above, the periodic statement alternative for government benefit accounts requires access to balance information through a readily available telephone line as well as at a terminal (such as by providing balance information at a balance-inquiry terminal or providing it, routinely or upon request, on a terminal receipt at the time of an EFT). The Bureau sought comment on whether a similar requirement to provide balance information at a terminal should be added to the requirements of proposed § 1005.18(c)(1)(i) for prepaid accounts generally. The Bureau also requested comment on whether, alternatively, the requirement to provide balance information for government benefit accounts at a terminal should be eliminated from § 1005.15, given the other enhancements proposed and for parity with proposed § 1005.18.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>A number of commenters, including consumer groups, an office of a State Attorney General, a State government agency, and a credit union, supported the proposal to extend to prepaid accounts the first part of the periodic statement alternative to provide access to a consumer's account balance through a readily available telephone line. In addition, these commenters, as well as several labor organizations, urged the Bureau to require free access to balance information at a terminal for all prepaid accounts. They explained that terminals are convenient and easy to use, especially for non-English speakers and consumers who have difficulty navigating an automated menu over the telephone. These commenters also noted that terminals provide account balances in real-time and are valuable to consumers with limited telephone and internet access.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several consumer groups also argued that imposing fees to access balance information at a terminal discourages consumers, especially those experiencing financial hardship, from monitoring transactions and exercising their error resolution rights under Regulation E. These commenters noted that paying for such access is especially difficult for consumers who are already experiencing financial hardship and that consumers generally do not expect to be charged for checking their balance information. They suggested that the cost of providing balance information at a terminal is minimal and should be bundled with the cost of withdrawals. However, one program manager challenged this point, arguing that access to balance information at a terminal is the most expensive method to check account balances because these transactions would likely generate a cost to merchants and networks that would likely then be assessed back to financial institutions. Another program manager urged the Bureau not to require access to balance information at a terminal given the costs to industry, and a credit union specifically requested that financial institutions not be required to provide access to balance information by both telephone and at a terminal.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter requested that the Bureau allow online access to a digital wallet account balance as an alternative to providing access via a readily accessible telephone line. This commenter explained that consumers who use digital wallets must have a means to access their accounts electronically, and that digital wallet providers use email and other electronic communications as the primary way to provide information to consumers. This commenter further explained that, given the relationship between the consumer and the digital wallet provider, it does not believe consumers of such products wish to check their account balance via telephone.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons discussed herein, the Bureau is finalizing § 1005.18(c)(1)(i) as proposed. The Bureau believes that, as part of the periodic statement alternative, access to balance information is essential for consumers to use and manage their accounts, The Bureau understands that providing such access through a readily available telephone line is a common method of doing so. In addition, the Bureau believes that most financial institutions already provide balance information by telephone. Notwithstanding the consumer benefits of accessing balance information at a terminal, the Bureau does not believe that requiring such access for all prepaid accounts justifies the additional costs to industry at this time, given that consumers can obtain balance information through other, less expensive methods. The Bureau also declines to exempt digital wallets that are prepaid accounts from the requirement to provide balance information by telephone under the periodic statement alternative, as requested by one commenter, because balance information should be accessible by telephone in the event online access to such information is unavailable.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As explained in the proposal, the Bureau expects that a readily available telephone line for providing balance information be a local or toll-free telephone line that, at a minimum, is available during standard business hours. Further, the Bureau expects that, in most cases, financial institutions would provide 24-hour access to balance information through an automated line, which would ensure that consumers could access balance information at their convenience. The Bureau reminds financial institutions that neither they nor their service providers are permitted to charge consumers a fee for accessing balance information by telephone, when providing that information as part of the periodic statement alternative pursuant to final § 1005.18(c)(1)(i).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>32(a) Temporary Exception for Insured Institutions</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.32(a)(1) provided a temporary exception for remittance transfer providers, which permits them to disclose estimates of the exchange rate, the transfer amount, other fees and taxes, and total to recipient if: (i) A remittance transfer provider cannot determine exact amounts for reasons beyond its control; (ii) a remittance transfer provider is an insured institution; and (iii) the remittance transfer is sent from the sender's account with the insured institution.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Most industry commenters generally supported permitting insured institutions to disclose estimates. For example, one commenter stated that restricting the use of estimates could discourage innovation and increase costs to offset risk. Consumer group commenters generally supported the proposed use of estimates but requested that the temporary exception not be extended. Some industry commenters, however, objected to permitting estimates to be disclosed because estimates could lead to inaccurate or misleading disclosures which would disservice consumers.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes permitting estimates, as provided by the temporary exception, is consistent with the statutory language and purpose of EFTA section 919(a)(4). The statute specifically provides that, subject to the Bureau's rules, an insured institution may use a reasonably accurate estimate of the amount of currency received under certain circumstances. Section 1005.32(a)(1) implements the temporary exception generally as proposed, as discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(4) only addresses estimates for the amount of currency that will be received by a designated recipient. Nonetheless, proposed § 205.32(a)(1) also permitted disclosure of an estimate for the exchange rate, the transfer amount in the currency made available to the designated recipient, the fees imposed by intermediaries in the transmittal route, and taxes imposed in the recipient country that are a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient to the extent those amounts are not known for reasons beyond the insured institution's control. In the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the Board stated its belief that, by permitting an estimate of the amount that will be received, Congress must have intended to permit estimates of the components that determine that amount. The inability to determine the exact amount of one or more of these additional items is the reason why the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient must be estimated. Furthermore, the Board stated that permitting estimates of these additional items would help consumers to understand why the amount of currency to be received is displayed as an estimate. The Bureau did not receive any comments on this aspect of the proposal. The Bureau concurs with the Board's reasoning, and believes that to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and facilitate compliance, it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to allow an estimate of the exchange rate, transfer amount, and other fees and taxes disclosures in § 1005.32(a)(1). To not exercise the Bureau's authority in this way would render the statutory exemption essentially meaningless, and the Bureau believes that result could not be intended by the statutory exemption for estimating the amount of currency received.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In the proposed rule, the Board also stated that EFTA section 919(a)(4) only addresses the use of an estimate of the amount of foreign currency that will be received by a designated recipient. However, the proposed rule permitted an estimate of the currency that will be received, whether it is in U.S. dollars or foreign currency. The Bureau understands that senders may send remittance transfers to be paid to the designated recipient in U.S. dollars. When an insured institution sends a remittance transfer via international wire transfer, fees are sometimes deducted by intermediary institutions in the transmittal route with which the sending institution has no correspondent relationship. Although the insured institution may not know the total amount of these fees in advance, it must disclose them to the sender under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). The amount that will be received by the designated recipient, whether that currency is U.S. dollars or foreign currency, will be an estimate if fees imposed by intermediaries are disclosed as estimates. Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of EFTA and to facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to allow an estimate of the amount of currency that will be received, even if that currency is in U.S. dollars.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The proposed commentary to § 205.32(a)(1) provided further guidance on the temporary exception. Specifically, proposed comment 32(a)(1)-1 clarified that an insured institution cannot determine exact amounts “for reasons beyond its control” when: (i) The exchange rate required to be disclosed under proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(iv) is set by a person with which the insured institution has no correspondent relationship after the insured institution sends the remittance transfer; or (ii) fees required to be disclosed under proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(vi) are imposed by intermediary institutions along the transmittal route and the insured institution has no correspondent relationship with those institutions.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter requested clarification regarding instances when an insured institution has a correspondent relationship but may not control or know what exchange rate the correspondent will use. For example, a remittance transfer provider may send a remittance transfer in U.S. dollars and a correspondent institution may be responsible for exchanging to the currency in which funds will be received. Similarly, other industry commenters noted that an insured institution may not know the taxes or fees imposed by a correspondent institution. Although the Bureau acknowledges that some insured institutions currently may not receive certain exchange rate, tax, or fee information from a correspondent institution, the Bureau believes that such information can be obtained through contractual arrangements in a correspondent relationship. The Bureau notes that the statutory exception is only available for circumstances beyond remittance transfer providers' control, and the Bureau believes that adjusting contractual arrangements with correspondent banks to provide for better information relay is within the control of remittance transfer providers. Accordingly, comment 32(a)(1)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed with clarifying revisions and an example.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 32(a)(1)-2 provided examples of scenarios that qualify for the temporary exception. The Bureau did not receive significant comment on the examples provided in the proposed comment. Comment 32(a)(1)-2 is adopted substantially as proposed with clarifying revisions. Comment 32(a)(1)-2.i. clarifies that an insured institution cannot determine the exact exchange rate to disclose for an international wire transfer if the insured institution does not set the exchange rate, and the rate is set when the funds are deposited into the recipient's account by the designated recipient's institution with which the insured institution does not have a correspondent relationship. The insured institution will not know the exchange rate that the recipient institution will apply when the funds are deposited into the recipient's account. Comment 32(a)(1)-2.ii. provides that an insured institution cannot determine the exact fees to disclose under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) if an intermediary institution or the designated recipient's institution, with which the insured institution does not have a correspondent relationship, imposes a transfer or conversion fee. Finally, comment 32(a)(1)-2.iii. states that an insured institution cannot determine the exact taxes to disclose under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) if the insured institution cannot determine the applicable exchange rate or other fees, as described in proposed comments 32(a)(1)-2.i. and 32(a)(1)-2.ii., and the recipient country imposes a tax that is a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient, less any other fees.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 32(a)(1)-3 provided several examples of when an insured institution would not qualify for the exception in proposed § 205.32(a). In each case, the insured institution could determine the exact amount for the relevant disclosure. The proposed examples illustrated that if an insured institution can determine the exact exchange rate, fees, and taxes required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) and (vi), it can determine the exact amounts to be derived from calculations involving them.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive significant comment on the proposed provision, which is adopted substantially as proposed. Comment 32(a)(1)-3.i. explains that an insured institution can determine the exact exchange rate required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) if it converts the funds into the local currency to be received by the designated recipient using an exchange rate that it sets. Comment 32(a)(1)-3.ii. states that an insured institution can determine the exact fees required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) if it has negotiated specific fees with a correspondent institution, and the correspondent institution is the only institution in the transmittal route to the designated recipient's institution, which itself does not impose fees. Finally, comment 32(a)(1)-3.iii. clarifies that an insured institution can determine the exact taxes required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) if the recipient country imposes a tax that is a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient, less any other fees, and the insured institution can determine the exact amount of the applicable exchange rate and other fees. Similarly, the insured institution can determine these taxes if the recipient country imposes a specific sum tax that is not tied to the amount transferred.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.32(a)(2) provided that the temporary exception expires on July 20, 2015, consistent with the five-year term set forth in EFTA section 919(a)(4)(B). EFTA section 919(a)(4)(B) gives the Bureau authority to extend the application of the temporary exception to July 21, 2020, if it determines that termination of the exception would negatively affect the ability of insured institutions to send remittances to foreign countries. The Bureau understands that this exception was intended to avoid an immediate disruption of remittance transfer services by insured institutions using international wire transfers. The exception gives these institutions time to reach agreements and modify systems to provide accurate disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters argued that the temporary exception for insured institutions should be made permanent, or in the alternative, be extended to ten years after the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, which is July 21, 2020. The OCC also noted the ability of the Bureau to extend the temporary exception for insured institutions to ten years after the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act and urged the Bureau to consider the impact of these standards on community banks. In contrast, consumer groups supported the five-year sunset of the temporary exception and requested that the Bureau indicate that the temporary exception will not be extended.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that the sunset of the temporary exception is statutory. In addition, the Bureau believes that there is no basis at this time to assess whether allowing the exception to expire in accordance with the statute would have negative effects where the final rule is just now being issued, initial implementation is expected to take a year, and the market has not yet had a chance to respond to the regulatory requirements. Therefore, the Bureau declines to extend the temporary exception at this time. Finally, the Bureau notes that in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, proposed § 205.32(a)(2) stated July 20, 2015 as the sunset date for the temporary exception provided in § 205.32(a)(1). The final rule includes a technical edit to clarify that the sunset date for the temporary exception is July 21, 2015 in order to avoid potential confusion and promote consistency among references to the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. Accordingly, proposed § 205.32(a)(2) is adopted as proposed in renumbered § 1005.32(a)(2), with a technical edit to reflect the change in date to July 21, 2015.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For purposes of the temporary exception, proposed § 205.32(a)(3) provided that the term “insured institution” included insured depository institutions as defined in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813) and insured credit unions as defined in section 101 of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1752). Industry commenters generally requested clarification on the application of the temporary exception to uninsured institutions. In particular, these commenters requested that the temporary exception should also include uninsured depository institutions, such as certain U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks. They also argued that uninsured U.S. branches of foreign banks also process retail international wire transfers in the same manner as insured institutions, and would face similar compliance challenges as other insured institutions.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that including uninsured U.S. branches of foreign banks in the term “insured institution” is consistent with the purposes of the statutory exception and will prevent disruption in remittance transfer services. The Bureau notes that section 3(c)(3) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that for certain purposes, the term “insured depository institution” includes any uninsured U.S. branch or agency of a foreign bank or a commercial lending company owned or controlled by a foreign bank. Therefore, the Bureau believes including uninsured U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks in the term “insured institution” is consistent with the statutory exception and section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Accordingly, proposed § 205.32(a)(3) is adopted with clarification in renumbered § 1005.32(a)(3).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Similarly, one commenter argued that registered broker-dealers should be covered by the temporary exception because they may process international wire transfers. However, as discussed above, the Bureau is clarifying that, for the purposes of this rule, fund transfers in connection with securities transactions are not remittance transfers. Therefore, the Bureau believes further clarification in the rule with respect to this comment is not necessary.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>32(a) Temporary Exception for Insured Institutions</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The Remittance Rule generally requires that a remittance transfer provider must disclose to a sender the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes that will apply to a remittance transfer, and the actual amount that the designated recipient of the remittance transfer will receive. However, subpart B sets forth four exceptions to this general rule. These exceptions permit providers to disclose estimates instead of actual amounts. EFTA section 919 provides two such exceptions. The exception at issue in § 1005.32(a) is a temporary exception for insured institutions with respect to remittance transfers a sender sends from the sender's account with the institution, as long as the provider cannot determined the exact amounts for reasons beyond its control. When the Bureau made the determination to extend the temporary exception to July 20, 2020, the Bureau's determination was limited to accounts under existing Regulation E. In other words, GPR cards and digital wallets that will become accounts under this final rule were not included in the scope of the temporary exemption. Accordingly, the Bureau is amending § 1005.32(a) to set forth that for purposes of § 1005.32(a), a sender's account does not include a prepaid account, unless the prepaid account is a payroll card account or a government benefit account. This amendment is intended to continue the current application of the Remittance Rule to prepaid products.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau adopts these clarifying and conforming amendments in subpart B pursuant to its authority under EFTA sections 904(a). EFTA section 904(a) authorizes the Bureau to prescribe regulations necessary to carry out the purposes of the title. The express purposes of the EFTA, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, are to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of participants in electronic fund and remittance transfer systems and to provide individual consumer rights.<footnote ref="563">EFTA section 902(b).</footnote>

      <title>2(b)(3)(i)(C)</title>
      <analysisParagraph>As noted above, several commenters requested that the Bureau revise the proposed definition of prepaid account to add greater certainty as to the scope of coverage. One commenter, a trade association, specifically suggested that the Bureau modify the definition to only apply to products that are expressly marketed and labeled as “prepaid.” The Bureau agrees that the addition of a provision focusing on marketing and labeling would provide greater clarity. The Bureau believes that all or most GPR cards are currently marketed or labeled as “prepaid,” either on the packaging or display of the card or in related advertising. As such, the Bureau believes that most, if not all, GPR cards will qualify as prepaid accounts under this provision of the definition. In addition, the Bureau believes that, in order to prevent consumer confusion and conform to consumer expectations, accounts that are marketed or labeled as “prepaid” should be accompanied by the same disclosures and protections that consumers will expect prepaid accounts to provide pursuant to this final rule.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is thus adopting new § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(C) to define as a prepaid account an account that is marketed or labeled as “prepaid.” The Bureau understands, however, that there are certain products that are intended for specific, limited purposes—for example, prepaid phone cards—that may use the term “prepaid” for marketing or labeling purposes, but which the Bureau did not intend to include under the definition of prepaid account by function of this prong. The Bureau is clarifying, therefore, that in order to qualify as a prepaid account under the “marketed or labeled” prong, an account must also be redeemable upon presentation at multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services or usable at ATMs. Accordingly, although products such as prepaid phone cards are marketed or labeled as “prepaid,” they would not qualify as prepaid accounts under this prong because they are not redeemable at multiple, unaffiliated merchants or usable at ATMs.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>To clarify the meaning of “marketed or labeled,” the Bureau is also adopting new comment 2(b)(3)(i)-3. That comment, which draws on similar existing commentary to Regulation E concerning the marketing and labeling of gift cards,<footnote ref="301">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; comment 20(b)(2)-2.</footnote>
             clarifies that the term “marketed or labeled as `prepaid' ” means promoting or advertising an account using the term “prepaid.” For example, an account is marketed or labeled as prepaid if the term “prepaid” appears on the access device associated with the account or the access device's packaging materials, or on a display, advertisement, or other publication to promote purchase or use of the account. The comment further clarifies that an account may be marketed or labeled as prepaid if the financial institution, its service provider, including a program manager, or the payment network on which an access device for the account is used, promotes or advertises, or contracts with another party to promote or advertise, the account using the label “prepaid.” Finally, the comment clarifies that a product or service that is marketed or labeled as prepaid is not a “prepaid account” if it does not otherwise meet the definition of account in § 1005.2(b)(1).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Appendix A—Model Disclosure Clauses and Forms</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed in Appendix A twelve model forms that a remittance transfer provider could use in connection with remittance transfers. The disclosures were proposed as model forms pursuant to EFTA section 904(a), rather than model clauses pursuant to EFTA section 904(b), in order to clearly demonstrate the general form and specific format requirements of proposed § 205.31(a) and (c). Proposed Model Forms A-30 through A-32 were developed in consumer testing and reflect a format in which the flow and organization of information effectively communicates the remittance disclosures to most consumers. Proposed Model Forms A-30 through A-41 were intended to demonstrate several formats a remittance transfer provider may use to comply with the disclosure requirements of proposed § 205.31.<footnote ref="88">Proposed Model Forms A-33 through A-35 and proposed Model Form A-37 were variations of the forms that were developed in consumer testing. Proposed Model Forms A-38 through A-40 were Spanish translations of proposed Model Forms A-30 through A-32. The language in the long form error resolution and cancellation notice in proposed Model Form A-36, and its Spanish translation in Model Form A-41, were based on the model form for error resolution in Regulation E. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 12 CFR part 1005, Appendix A to part 1005, Form A-3.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed to amend instruction 2 to Appendix A regarding the use of model forms and added instruction 4 to Appendix A to describe how a remittance transfer provider may properly use and alter the model forms. Specifically, the Board proposed to amend instruction 2 to Appendix A to include references to remittance transfer providers and remittance transfers and updated the numbering of the liability provisions of the EFTA as sections 916 and 917. The proposed instruction therefore clarified that the use of the proposed model forms in making disclosures would protect a remittance transfer provider from liability under sections 916 and 917 of the EFTA if they accurately reflected the provider's remittance transfer services. The Bureau did not receive comments on proposed instruction 2, and it is adopted substantially as proposed, with an addition to reference § 1005.36 that was added in the final rule.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also did not receive any comments on proposed instruction 4 to Appendix A, and it is adopted substantially as proposed. The instruction includes one change to address the Bureau's role in reviewing and approving disclosure forms. The instruction also contains modifications to address the addition of § 1005.36 in the final rule. Accordingly, instruction 4 to Appendix A states that the Bureau will not review or approve disclosure forms for remittance transfer providers, but that the appendix contains 12 model forms for use in connection with remittance transfers. The instruction explains that Model Forms A-30 through A-32 demonstrate how a provider can provide the required disclosures for a remittance transfer exchanged into local currency. Model Forms A-33 through A-35 demonstrate how a provider can provide the required disclosures for U.S. dollar-to-U.S. dollar remittance transfers. These forms also demonstrate disclosure of the required content, in accordance with the grouping and proximity requirements of § 1005.31(c)(1) and (2), in both a register receipt format and an 8.5 inch by 11 inch format. Model Form A-36 provides long form model error resolution and cancellation disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(4), and Model Form A-37 provides short form model error resolution and cancellation disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) and (vi).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Instruction 4 to Appendix A also explains that a remittance transfer provider may use the language and formatting provided in Forms A-38 through A-41 for disclosures that are required to be provided in Spanish, pursuant to the requirements of § 1005.31(g). It also clarifies that the model forms may contain certain information that is not required by subpart B, such as a confirmation code and the sender's name and contact information. This information is included on the model forms to demonstrate one way of displaying this information in compliance with § 1005.31(c)(4). Any additional information must be presented consistent with a remittance transfer provider's obligation to provide required disclosures in a clear and conspicuous manner.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Instruction 4 to Appendix A further clarifies that use of the model forms is optional. A remittance transfer provider may change the forms by rearranging the format or by making modifications to the language of the forms, without modifying the substance of the disclosures. The instruction clarifies that rearrangement or modification of the format of the model forms is permissible, as long as it is consistent with the form, grouping, proximity, and other requirements of § 1005.31(a) and (c). Providers making revisions that do not comply with this section will lose the benefit of the safe harbor for appropriate use of Model Forms A-30 to A-41.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Instruction 4 to Appendix A also provides examples of permissible changes a remittance transfer provider may make to the language and format of the model forms without losing the benefit of the safe harbor. For example, a remittance transfer provider may substitute the information contained in the model forms that is intended to demonstrate how to complete the information in the model forms—such as names, addresses, and Web sites; dates; numbers; and State-specific contact information—with information applicable to the remittance transfer. A remittance transfer provider may also eliminate disclosures that are not applicable to the transfer, as permitted under § 1005.31(b), or provide the required disclosures on a paper size that is different from a register receipt and 8.5 inch by 11 inch formats. A remittance transfer provider may correct or update telephone numbers, mailing addresses, or Web site addresses that may change over time. This example applies to all telephone numbers and addresses on a model form, including the contact information of the provider, the State agency, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The instruction clarifies that adding the term “Estimated” or a substantially similar term and in close proximity to the estimated term or terms, as required under § 1005.31(d), is a permissible change to the model forms. A provider may provide the required disclosures in a foreign language, or multiple foreign languages, subject to the requirements of § 1005.31(g), without losing the benefit of the safe harbor.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Instruction 4 to Appendix A includes an additional example of a permissible change a remittance transfer provider may make to the language and format of the model forms without losing the benefit of the safe harbor to reflect the addition of § 1005.36 in the final rule. The instruction clarifies that a remittance transfer provider may substitute cancellation language to reflect the right to a cancellation made pursuant to the requirements of § 1005.36(c). For example, for disclosures provided for a preauthorized remittance transfer, a provider could replace the statement that a sender can cancel the remittance transfer within 30 minutes with a statement that a sender may cancel up to three business days before the date of each transfer. Finally, instruction 4 to Appendix A also clarifies that adding language to a form that is not segregated from the required disclosures is impermissible, other than as permitted by § 1005.31(c)(4).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Although the Bureau did not receive comments on the instructions to Model Forms A-30 through A-41, the Bureau did receive suggested changes to the terminology used in and the formatting of the model forms. For example, consumer group commenters believed that the amount of the cost of the transaction expressed as “Total” in the proposal should be labeled in bold as “Total cost to you of this transfer” and that “Total to recipient” should be labeled in bold as “Total amount recipient should receive.” The commenters also believed the term “Total Amount” was too generic and instead should be “Amount Transferred.” An industry commenter believed that fees and taxes charged by entities other than the remittance transfer provided should be labeled as “Receive” or “Payout” fees and taxes, rather than “Other” fees and taxes.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that the proposed terms sufficiently describe the amounts disclosed on the model forms. The proposed terms were used in consumer testing, and nearly all participants understood the amounts that were disclosed. Moreover, the Bureau believes that requiring bolding or similar font requirements could pose compliance difficulties for remittance transfer providers that print the disclosures on a register or other printing device that does not permit such font changes, and participants in consumer testing did not have difficulty finding this information on the forms. Thus, the Bureau is adopting the terms and format as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters asserted that the content of the long form error resolution and cancellation notice in Model Form A-36 was misleading and not consumer friendly. The commenters provided edits to the disclosure that the commenter believed would be more helpful to a sender. The long form error resolution and cancellation disclosure is based on the model form for error resolution in Regulation E. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 31 CFR part 1005, Appendix A to part 1005, Form A-3. The Bureau believes that any changes to this model form should be made in conjunction with the corresponding changes to existing Regulation E model forms and that such changes should be subject to consumer testing. Therefore, the Bureau is adopting the content of Model Form A-36 as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Other commenters suggested substantive changes that, if adopted, would result in changes to the model forms. For example, some industry commenters suggested that the Bureau eliminate the requirement to disclose fees and taxes charged by a person other than the remittance transfer provider and that the model forms should instead indicate generally that other fees and charges may apply. Similarly, industry commenters suggested the exchange rate and funds availability date should be permitted to be estimated and, therefore, the model forms should state that these disclosures are subject to change. As discussed above, the Bureau is not adopting these substantive changes in the final rule. Consequently, the Bureau is not adopting the corresponding changes to the model forms.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, a consumer advocate suggested that a fraud warning should be added to the model forms. Such a warning is not required in the statute, and the Bureau believes that the disclosures should be limited to information relating to cost, error resolution, and cancellation. Adding more information and warnings to forms could overwhelm a sender and result in the sender not reading any of the information on the form. Therefore, the Bureau is not adding such a fraud warning to the model disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is, however, making two changes to the model forms that reflect changes from the proposal to the final rule, as discussed above. First, the Bureau is requiring that fees and taxes must be disclosed separately. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 31(b)(1)-1. As such, the model forms have been amended to demonstrate how a remittance transfer provider would disclose fees separately from taxes. Second, the final rule provides that a sender may cancel a transaction within thirty minutes of making payment, rather than within one business day, as proposed, and the model forms have been amended to reflect this change.<footnote ref="89">As noted above, this cancellation language may be amended to the extent § 1005.36(c) applies.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is making additional changes to Model Form A-37 in the final rule. The Bureau is removing sample phone number, Web site, and remittance transfer company name that was included in the proposed form. Unlike the model pre-payment disclosures, receipts, and combined disclosures, sample information is not necessary to demonstrate how the short form error resolution and cancellation disclosures should be completed. Thus, in the final rule, Model Form A-37 includes brackets indicating where this information should be entered by a provider. The forward slash used in the proposal to indicate that funds may be picked up or deposited is also replaced with the word “or.” The Bureau is also amending the abbreviated statement about senders' error resolution rights on Model Form A-37 to include a more explicit statement informing senders that they have such rights.<footnote ref="90">These changes were also made to Model Forms A-31, A-32, A-34, and A-35 where the language in Model Form A-37 is used. The changes are also reflected in the Spanish language disclosures.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also making minor technical changes in some of the model forms in the final rule for clarity. Plus signs are added to some forms to indicate where fees and taxes will be added to a transfer amount to better demonstrate the calculation of the total amount paid by the sender.<footnote ref="91">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See,&lt;/em&gt; Model Forms A-30 through A-35 and A-38 through A-40.</footnote>
             The internet address for the sample State regulatory agency is also amended on some forms with the suffix “.gov” rather than “.com.” <footnote ref="92">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See,&lt;/em&gt; Model Forms A-31, A-32, A-34, A-35, A-39, and A-40.</footnote>
             The toll-free telephone numbers for the Bureau have also been added to some forms.<footnote ref="93">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See,&lt;/em&gt; Model Forms A-31, A-32, A-34, A-35, A-39, and A-40.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, Model Forms A-38 through A-41 may be used when disclosures are required to be disclosed in Spanish, pursuant to the requirements in § 1005.31(g). The Board proposed model disclosures in Spanish to facilitate compliance with this foreign language requirement and requested comment on the disclosures. One commenter submitted spelling, grammar and verb tense revisions to the Spanish language disclosures. The commenter believed the Spanish language disclosures, as proposed, did not adequately communicate the intent of the language used in the English disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Certain commenter-suggested revisions have been made in Model Forms A-38 through A-41 to correct inaccuracies in the proposed Spanish language disclosures. However, in other instances, the suggested revisions have not been made. Although the proposed language and the commenter-suggested revisions reflected stylistic variations, both contained accurate translations of the English language model forms. Therefore, the technical corrections are included in Model Forms A-38 through A-41 in the final rule. The Bureau also made stylistic changes to the Spanish language model forms that it believes better tracks the language in the English language disclosures.<footnote ref="94">One of the stylistic changes made to the Spanish language model forms was to change the format for the dates to eliminate possible consumer confusion as to the day, the month, and the year. Similar changes have been made to the English language model forms for consistency.</footnote>

        <title>Effective Date</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Bureau to issue final rules on certain provisions of EFTA section 919 within 18 months from the date of enactment. However, the statute does not specify an effective date for these provisions. The Board solicited comment in the May 2011 Proposed Rule on whether an effective date of one year from the date the final rule is published, or an alternative effective date would be appropriate.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter agreed that 12 months would be an appropriate time period to implement the remittance transfer provisions. However, several other industry commenters recommended that the effective date of the final rule be set 18 to 24 months from the date that the final rule is issued. In suggesting this time period, money transmitter commenters stated that they would need time to change hardware printers and software. Agents of remittance transfer providers would also need time to integrate software from the remittance transfer provider with their point of sale systems. Industry commenters also requested time to deplete their existing form stock, develop and implement proper training programs, and amend contracts with agent locations worldwide.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Financial institution commenters cited the need for messaging, settlement, and payment systems, such as the ACH network and SWIFT, to evaluate and possibly amend operating rules, message formats, contracts, and participant agreements. These commenters also stated they would need time to: Complete processing system modifications; develop disclosures, operating procedures, marketing and employee training materials; and make modifications to agreements with correspondents and other intermediaries. They further requested that the Bureau take into account other regulatory requirement set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act that financial institutions must implement in addition to the remittance transfer provisions.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Given the time period set for compliance with other consumer financial protection regulations, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to set an effective date one year from the date of publication of the final rule in the <em data-original="E-04">Federal Register</em>. In setting this effective date, the Bureau believes that this time frame best balances the significant consumer protection interests addressed by this rule against industry's need to make systems changes to comply with the final rule. Therefore, the disclosure requirements in § 1005.31 will apply to remittance transfers that are requested by a sender on or after the effective date. Only remittance transfers for which a sender made payment on or after the effective date will be eligible for the error resolution and refund and cancellation requirements of §§ 1005.33 and 1005.34. For preauthorized remittance transfers, the disclosure requirements in § 1005.36(a) and (b) will apply to preauthorized remittance transfers authorized by a sender on or after the effective date. For transactions subject to § 1005.36(c), the error resolution and refund requirements of §§ 1005.33 and 1005.34 and the cancellation requirements of § 1005.36(c) will apply to transfers authorized by a sender on or after the effective date.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Appendix A—Model Disclosure Clauses and Forms</title>
      <analysisParagraph>In Appendix A of the 2012 Final Rule, the Bureau provides twelve model forms that a remittance transfer provider may use in connection with remittance transfers.  The 2012 Final Rule also provides instructions related to the use of these model forms.  In particular, Instruction 4 to Appendix A provides general instructions for how providers may use the model forms, including instructions as to formatting and necessary disclosures.  Instruction 4 also describes what portions of the disclosures are optional, and states that the Bureau will not review or approve providers' disclosure forms.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In light of the changes to the 2012 Final Rule's disclosure requirements discussed above, the 2013 Final Rule amends the model forms, as well as the related instructions in Appendix A, and includes several additional model forms reflecting the new requirements.  First, the Bureau is removing from all of the model forms references to “Other Taxes” because the Bureau has eliminated this disclosure requirement. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi).  Second, although there is no longer a requirement to disclose recipient institution fees in certain circumstances, there remains a requirement that remittance transfer providers disclose covered third-party fees under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi).  As a result, the line on the model forms that relates to the disclosure of the amount of “Other Fees” has been retained and will now reflect only covered third-party fees imposed upon the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Third, insofar as § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) requires a remittance transfer provider to include disclaimers on the required disclosures where non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider may apply, the model forms have been amended to include versions of these disclaimers.  These disclaimers are required unless a provider knows that neither non-covered third-party fees nor taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider apply. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) and comment 31(b)(1)(viii)-1.  Thus, where a disclaimer is necessary, there are now three potential disclaimer statements that could be used depending on the nature of the transaction:  (1) A disclaimer that states that the recipient may receive less due to fees charged by the recipient's bank; <footnote ref="12">In the interest of clarity on the model forms, non-covered third-party fees are referred to as “fees charged by a recipient's bank.”  However, to the extent that the term “bank” is imprecise, a provider may use an alternate term to describe the recipient institution.</footnote>
             (2) A disclaimer that states that the recipient may receive less due to foreign taxes; <footnote ref="13">Also in the interest of clarity, these taxes are described as “foreign taxes,” although it is possible that the taxes collected by a person other than the provider could include taxes imposed by a U.S. state or the Federal government where such taxes are not collected by the provider.</footnote>
             or (3) A disclaimer that states that the recipient may receive less due to fees charged by the recipient's bank and foreign taxes. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In addition to the requirement to include these disclaimers, a remittance transfer provider may also elect to disclose the actual or estimated amounts of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected by a person other than the provider. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> §§ 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) and 1005.32(b)(3).  Model forms A-30(a) through (d) include samples of how a provider may include versions of these required disclaimers, as well as the optional disclosures regarding the actual or estimated amount of such fees and taxes. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Specifically, Model Form A-30(a) provides sample disclaimer language that “a recipient may receive less due to fees charged by the recipient's bank and foreign taxes.”  Model Forms A-30(b) through (d) include examples of how a remittance transfer provider could include the optional estimates of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider.  Specifically, Model Form A-30(b) includes a sample disclaimer that shows a parenthetical containing an estimate of the applicable non-covered third-party fees that may apply to the sample transfer, while Model Form A-30(c) includes a sample disclaimer that shows a parenthetical with an estimate for the taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider that may apply.  Model Form A-30(d) includes an example for how a provider could provide an estimate for both non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider.  Finally, although not included in a model form, if a provider knows that fees or taxes will be deducted, the disclaimer could indicate that the recipient “will receive less,” rather than “may receive less,” due to non-disclosed fees and taxes.  A provider also may elect to include the precise amounts for fees and/or taxes. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Instruction 4 also has been amended to indicate that the disclosure of the actual or estimated amounts for non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected by a person other than the provider is optional as provided in § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) in the 2013 Final Rule.  Instruction 4 also now includes language that a remittance transfer provider cannot include disclaimers that cannot apply to the particular transfer.  For example, if the provider knows that the only fees that can apply to the transfer are covered third-party fees, a provider should not include a fee disclaimer. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) and comment 31(b)(1)(viii)-1. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, because additional model forms have been added, the Appendix and Instructions are revised to indicate that there are now 15 model forms.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Effective Date</title>
        <analysisParagraph>This final rule is effective on October 28, 2013.  As discussed below, the Bureau believes that this effective date will, on balance, facilitate the implementation of both the remaining requirements of the 2012 Final Rule and the new requirements of the 2013 Final Rule.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In the December Proposal, the Bureau proposed to temporarily delay the effective date of the 2012 Final Rule from February 7, 2013, until 90 days after the publication of the 2013 Final Rule in the <em data-original="E-04">Federal Register</em>.  The Bureau stated then that it believed that this modest delay would balance the need for consumers to receive the protections afforded by the rule as quickly as possible with industry's need to make adjustments to comply with the provisions of the rule.  As part of the December Proposal, the Bureau sought comment on this proposed 90-day extension period.  On January 29, 2013, in the Temporary Delay Rule, the Bureau temporarily delayed the February 7, 2013 effective date pending completion of this rulemaking. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>All commenters—including consumer group commenters—generally agreed that the Bureau should extend the effective date of the 2013 Final Rule until at least 90 days after it is published in the <em data-original="E-04">Federal Register</em>.  Although no commenters suggested an implementation period of fewer than 90 days following publication of the 2013 Final Rule, one consumer group commenter noted that while it did not object to a 90 day-extension, it saw no need for any implementation period longer than 90 days after the finalization of this rule.  Additionally, one industry trade association suggested a 90-day implementation period could be workable depending on the scope of the final rule.  Most industry commenters, however, urged the Bureau to extend the effective date beyond 90 days.  In doing so, industry commenters suggested a range of periods—with many industry commenters suggesting periods of between 180 and 365 days following the publication of the 2013 Final Rule.  One industry trade association provided an example of an implementation timeline suggesting that a large correspondent would need at least 121 days from when the final rule is released in order to integrate a compliance solution within its client banks' systems.  Industry commenters in general contended that remittance transfer providers, their vendors, and other business partners all would need additional time to adjust their computer systems and compliance procedures, renegotiate contracts, and train staff. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Separately, commenters representing smaller insured institutions in particular requested a longer implementation period, stating that many of these remittance transfer providers depend on larger third-parties to aid their compliance.  These commenters uniformly stated that smaller providers might face particular challenges with implementing necessary changes over a short time period because smaller providers will only be able to integrate compliance solutions after the third parties have incorporated necessary updates and conduct testing, and include the changes in their scheduled releases.  Relatedly, a number of these commenters referenced the Bureau's recent rulemakings pursuant to title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act <footnote ref="14">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Escrow Requirements under the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z), 78 FR 4725 (Jan. 22, 2013); Ability to Repay and Qualified Mortgage Standards Under the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z), 78 FR 6407 (Jan. 30, 2013; High-Cost Mortgage and Homeownership Counseling Amendments to the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z) and Homeownership Counseling Amendments to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (Regulation X), 78 FR 6855 (Jan. 31, 2013); Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (Regulation X) and Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z) Mortgage Servicing Final Rules, 78 FR 10695 (Feb. 14, 2013); Disclosure and Delivery Requirements for Copies of Appraisals and Other Written Valuations Under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (Regulation B), 78 FR 7215 (Jan. 31, 2013); Appraisals for Higher-Priced Mortgage Loans, 78 FR 10367 (Feb. 13, 2013); Loan Originator Compensation Requirements under the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z), 78 FR 11279 (Feb. 15, 2013).</footnote>
             and indicated that implementing all of the requirements of those rules and the requirements of this final rule at the same time will create a significant cumulative burden.  These industry commenters also expressed concern over both the breadth and complexity of new rules expected from the Bureau. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The industry commenters' concerns regarding the implementation period, particularly those relating to necessary system changes, were largely focused around three expected results of the 2012 Final Rule, as it would have been modified by the December Proposal: (1) The need to build and maintain a database of applicable taxes imposed by foreign countries' central governments; (2) the need to obtain fee schedules or other information regarding applicable recipient institution fees in order to compute estimates of the applicable fees; and (3) the need to adjust systems and processes to accommodate the provisions discussing resends to correct errors that occurred because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information.  Furthermore, some industry commenters suggested that the appropriate effective date would depend on the scope of the final rule.  Noting the difficulty of collecting certain information concerning recipient institution fees and foreign taxes, as indicated above, one industry trade association commenter indicated that if the Bureau eliminated the requirement to disclose recipient institution fees and foreign taxes and simplified the procedure for resends, then this commenter thought that a 90-day implementation period could be workable. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting an effective date of October 28, 2013.  In light of the way the Bureau has streamlined the requirements of the 2012 Final Rule, the Bureau believes that an effective date of October 28, 2013 (or approximately 180 days after the release of the 2013 Final Rule) will allow sufficient time for providers, both large and small, to implement any necessary changes to their systems in order to comply with the 2013 Final Rule.  The Bureau is adopting a date certain in order to eliminate the risks of delay and provide greater assurances to both consumers and industry as to when to expect the valuable protections of the new rule.  The Bureau also believes that this implementation period allows sufficient time because the Bureau is not adopting the aspects of the December Proposal that commenters identified as requiring the most time to implement. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The primary additional substantive requirements in the 2013 Final Rule are the requirement that remittance transfer providers include disclaimers regarding non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected by a person other than the provider and adopt additional verification measures and provide notice to senders of the potential loss of funds to take advantage of the Bureau's expansion of the exception to the definition of the term error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D).  The Bureau believes that any programmatic changes required by these  provisions should not take most providers a particularly long period of time to implement. To the extent providers need to change the terms of their consumer contracts or other communications to provide senders the notice contemplated by § 1005.33(h)(3), the Bureau expects the required time to produce this notice will be modest, particularly because the 2013 Final Rule does not mandate any particular notice form, or format apart from requiring that such notice be clear and conspicuous and meet certain foreign language requirements.  Although translating such notice may require testing and certain systems changes, and the Bureau expects that many providers will integrate any such notice into existing communications or the required prepayment disclosures. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Moreover, based on its outreach and monitoring of the market, the Bureau believes that responsible providers and correspondents are already using reasonable methods of verification to reduce the risk of errors.  Nonetheless, recognizing that the 2013 Final Rule will likely require changes to informational technology and operational procedures and that small providers may benefit from additional time in order to test compliance solutions for their customers, the Bureau believes a modest increase in the implementation period from what was proposed may limit potential disruptions in the remittance transfer market. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For these reasons, the Bureau is expanding the implementation period for this final rule beyond what was proposed by making it effective October 28, 2013.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>36(a)(1) Timing of Disclosures for One-Time Transfers Scheduled Before the Date of Transfer and the First in a Series of Preauthorized Remittance Transfers</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.36(a) of the February Final Rule addresses the timing of required disclosures for preauthorized remittance transfers. Section 1005.36(a)(1) of the February Final Rule requires that, for the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the pre-payment disclosure and receipt be provided in the same manner as required for all other transfers. In the February Proposal, the Bureau sought comment on whether to make further adjustments in the disclosure rules for preauthorized remittance transfers and certain other transfers scheduled before the date of transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>With respect to the timing of pre-payment disclosures and receipts given to senders upon request of and payment for a transfer, the Bureau received few comments, apart from those raising the concerns discussed earlier regarding the disclosure of exact exchange rates far before the date of a remittance transfer. Largely, industry commenters did not raise other concerns about the requirement that remittance transfer providers give pre-payment disclosures (or combined disclosures) when transfers are requested and prior to payment and receipts (if no combined disclosures were provided) when payment is authorized for either one-time transfers scheduled before the date of transfer or the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers. In the final rule, the Bureau maintains the requirement from the February Final Rule that for any one-time remittance transfer scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer, and for the first transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, a remittance transfer provider must provide a pre-payment disclosure and a receipt to the sender subject to the same timing rules that apply to any one-time transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For clarity and consistency, the Bureau is revising § 1005.36(a)(1) from the February Final Rule as a new § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) by adjusting the provision to apply both to a one-time advance transfer scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer and the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, rather than just the latter. The Bureau is also clarifying that remittance transfer providers may use combined disclosures, pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(3), for transfers covered by this provision.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also requested comment on what follow-up disclosures, if any, should be provided to senders after authorization of a remittance transfer scheduled before the date of transfer. Specifically the Bureau asked whether a second receipt with accurate information should be provided to a sender within a reasonable time period prior to such a transfer, if the remittance transfer provider previously disclosed estimates pursuant to proposed § 1005.32(b)(2).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Most industry commenters argued against requiring a second receipt with accurate figures to be given prior to a remittance transfer when the original pre-payment disclosure and receipt contained estimates. These commenters argued that to the extent such a provision required disclosure of accurate figures ten days before the date of transfer, it would render the exception allowing providers to disclose estimates meaningless.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>To the extent the Bureau would instead allow a second receipt to contain estimates, industry commenters argued that giving senders three documents (a pre-payment disclosure when requesting the remittance transfer, a receipt when payment is authorized for the transfer, and a second receipt a reasonable time before the transfer) would be confusing and unhelpful to senders. One industry commenter suggested there would be limited value added by a second receipt that could contain information that, other than updated estimated exchange rates and associated figures, would be identical to the information included in the initial receipt. Another commenter expressed concern that a sender could be confused into thinking that a remittance transfer provider has made a single transfer multiple times or that an error had occurred, necessitating the additional disclosure. Industry commenters also stated that they thought senders would benefit little from additional disclosures before a transfer, particularly when any such benefit is balanced against the increased upfront and ongoing costs to the remittance transfer providers of giving senders the additional receipt. These commenters argued that providers would pass these costs on to senders. Finally, as an alternative to a second pre-transfer receipt, one industry commenter suggested that providers give senders receipts reflecting actual figures (and not estimates) after the providers send the transfers to the designated recipient. Consumer group commenters argued that receipts with actual figures (and not estimates) be provided to senders a reasonable time prior to the date of each transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In light of the Bureau's decision to allow the use of estimates in certain disclosures for remittance transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of a remittance transfer rather than ten days as originally proposed, the Bureau believes that a follow-up receipt provided closer to the date of the transfer is not likely to provide significant benefit to senders in many cases. For example, if a remittance transfer provider schedules a remittance transfer one month before the date of transfer, and discloses an estimated exchange rate at that time, and then provides a sender a receipt with an accurate exchange rate only four business days before the date of transfer (because unless a statutory exception applies, § 1005.32(b)(2) of the final rule permits estimates only for disclosures five or more business days before the date of transfer) the receipt might not reach the sender before the expiration of the three-business-day cancellation period in § 1005.36(c). Conversely, if this follow-up receipt were sent five or more business days before the date of transfer, estimates of certain amounts would be permitted under § 1005.32(b)(2). The Bureau believes that such a disclosure generally would be of little additional value as compared to the initial estimate provided in the pre-payment disclosure and receipt required by § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) if the wholesale rate, and thus the retail rate, had not moved significantly since the initial estimate was provided.

      <analysisParagraph>Although the Bureau is not requiring a second receipt closer to the time of transfer, the Bureau believes that for every remittance transfer, where a sender receives a disclosure that contains estimates pursuant to § 1005.32, the sender should also receive an accurate post-transfer disclosure that informs the sender of the actual exchange rate (as well as fees, taxes, and other figures) applied to the transfer. Thus, to further consumer protections, the Bureau is adopting a revised § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii), which requires that if the disclosures provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) contain estimates as permitted by § 1005.32(b)(2) (for transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer), the provider must mail or deliver to the sender an additional receipt meeting the requirements described in § 1005.31(b)(2) no later than one business day after the date of transfer.<footnote ref="17">The timing requirement in § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) does not prevent a remittance transfer provider from providing this receipt before the date of the transfer. The same is true for disclosures required by § 1005.36(a)(2)(ii), which are discussed below.</footnote>
             If the transfer involves the transfer of funds from the sender's account held by the provider, the receipt required by § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) may be provided on or with the next periodic statement for that account, or within 30 days after the date of the transfer if a periodic statement is not provided. As required by § 1005.36(b)(3), which is discussed below, this receipt must contain accurate figures unless estimates are allowed by § 1005.32(a) or (b)(1).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As many remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer are conducted by senders who have accounts with remittance transfer providers, the Bureau believes the final rule may relieve many providers of having to provide receipts immediately after each preauthorized remittance transfer or after one-time transfer scheduled five or more business days before the date of the transfer. In addition, the Bureau believes that an accurate receipt will ensure that senders receive accurate accountings of their transfers. Furthermore, to the extent that senders of preauthorized remittance transfers want to comparison shop based on price for future transfers, these receipts may be a mechanism that allows senders to better understand providers' pricing mechanisms (by allowing a sender to know the exchange rate applied to each transfer) and the amount received by the designated recipient.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>15(g) Government Benefit Accounts Accessible by Hybrid Prepaid-Credit Cards</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1005.15(g), which would have required that for credit plans linked to government benefit accounts, a government agency would have to comply with prohibitions and requirements applicable to prepaid accounts as set forth in proposed § 1005.18(g). The Bureau did not receive any comments regarding this portion of the proposal, and is finalizing § 1005.15(g) largely as proposed with minor modifications to incorporate the term hybrid prepaid-credit card that this final rule is adopting under new Regulation Z § 1026.61.

      <title>18(b)(2)(i) Periodic Fee</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) would have required disclosure of a periodic fee charged for holding a prepaid account, assessed on a monthly or other periodic basis, using the term “Monthly fee,” “Annual fee,” or a substantially similar term. The proposal stated the provision was intended to capture regular maintenance fees that a financial institution levies on a consumer solely for having a prepaid account for a period of time, whether the fee is charged monthly, annually, or for some other period of time. A financial institution could choose a label for this fee that accurately reflects the relevant periodic interval. Pursuant to the formatting requirements in proposed § 1005.18(b)(4), a financial institution would have been required to disclose this fee in the top line of the short form disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The proposal set forth the following reasons for the Bureau's proposed requirement that financial institutions disclose the presence or absence of a periodic fee as the first item in the short form. First, the Bureau's analysis of fee data indicated that many prepaid accounts charge a recurring fee, typically on a monthly basis. Second, the Bureau believed a periodic fee is one that consumers will likely pay no matter what other fees they incur because it is imposed for maintaining the prepaid account, unless a financial institution offers a way for a consumer to avoid that fee (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> through the receipt of a regular direct deposit or maintaining a certain average daily account balance). Those prepaid accounts that do not assess a periodic fee often charge other fees instead, typically per purchase fees.<footnote ref="388">The Bureau also proposed to require the disclosure of per purchase fees on the top line of the short form. As discussed in greater detail below, the Bureau is finalizing the per purchase fee disclosure mostly as proposed, including locating it in the top line of the short form. See the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii) below.</footnote>
             The Bureau therefore believed that the lack of a periodic fee is also an important feature of a prepaid account that should be included in the top line to allow consumers to more easily identify this trade-off between periodic fees and per purchase fees. Third, the Bureau believed that the existence of a monthly fee (or lack thereof) is typically a key factor in a consumer's decision about whether to acquire a particular prepaid account. Additionally, the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing showed that participants frequently cited periodic fees as one of the most important factors influencing their decision about which prepaid account to acquire.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>No commenter opposed disclosure of the periodic fee, though an issuing bank requested that the Bureau permit disclosure in the short form of the conditions under which a financial institution may waive the periodic fee and many other commenters urged more generally to provide latitude to financial institutions to disclose conditions for waiver or reduction of all listed fees.<footnote ref="389">These comments are addressed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(3) below.</footnote>
             An office of a State Attorney General recommended that the Bureau ban periodic fees for payroll card accounts, but otherwise supported the disclosure required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>).</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>), renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(2)(i), with minor technical modifications for conformity and clarity. Also, for the reasons set forth below, the Bureau is adopting comment 18(b)(2)(i)-1.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is finalizing the requirement that financial institutions disclose the periodic fee as the first fee on the short form disclosure because it is a virtually universal charge and, even if a per purchase fee is incurred instead of the periodic fee, the Bureau continues to believe that consumers should be apprised of the trade-off between the two pricing schemes.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees that it may be particularly important for consumers to be aware of waivers and discounts of the periodic fee, and thus is adopting a new provision in the final rule that permits financial institutions to disclose, in addition to the highest fee, conditions under which the periodic fee may vary. While final § 1005.18(b)(3)(i) requires disclosure of the highest fee when a fee can vary, final § 1005.18(b)(3)(ii) permits a financial institution to disclose a waiver of or reduction in the fee amount for the periodic fee in language lower down in the short form disclosure. See the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(3) below for a discussion of the comments received and analysis leading to the adoption of this alternative for the periodic fee.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>To clarify the specific applicability of final § 1005.18(b)(3)(i) and (ii) to the periodic fee disclosure required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(i), the Bureau is adopting new comment 18(b)(2)(i)-1. Comment 18(b)(2)(i)-1 states that, if the amount of a fee disclosed on the short form could vary, the financial institution must disclose in the short form the information required by final § 1005.18(b)(3)(i). If the amount of the periodic fee could vary, the financial institution may opt instead to use an alternative disclosure pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(3)(ii). The Bureau is adopting this comment to direct attention to the alternative disclosure of the periodic fee in the short form permitted by § 1005.18(b)(3)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With regard to the comment recommending that the Bureau ban the periodic fee for payroll card accounts, such a request is outside the scope of this rulemaking.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>31(b)(2)(vi) Agency Contact Information</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(vi) provided for disclosure of a statement that the sender can contact the State agency that regulates the remittance transfer provider and the Bureau for questions or complaints about the remittance transfer provider, using language set forth in Model Form A-37 of Appendix A or substantially similar language. The proposed statement included contact information for these agencies, including the toll-free telephone number of the Bureau established under section 1013 of the Dodd-Frank Act.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Board requested comment on several aspects of proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(vi). First, the Board solicited comment on whether and how a remittance transfer provider should be required to disclose information regarding a State agency that regulates the provider for remittance transfers conducted through a toll-free telephone number or online and, if so, what would be the appropriate State agency to disclose to a sender. Some commenters believed the disclosure of Bureau contact information would be sufficient. Several industry commenters argued that the Bureau should not require a remittance transfer provider to disclose the State agency that regulates the remittance transfer. These commenters believed the requirement would create operational hurdles for providers that operate in multiple states and would provide negligible consumer protection benefit.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One money transmitter commenter stated that it would be difficult to tailor State regulator disclosures to each individual agent, and that managing State-specific receipts and forms would be costly. This commenter stated that agents that provide services in multiple states often distribute forms to their locations as part of their chain of distribution. Requiring these agents to manage State-specific forms, the commenter argued, would be a significant change in distribution processes and could create liability risk for the remittance transfer provider. This commenter believed remittance transfer providers would thus create a multi-State disclosure form, which would provide senders with superfluous information.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Another money transmitter commenter noted that many states already have guidance regarding the prominence and placement of contact information on a remittance transfer provider's Web site and in storefront locations. The commenter stated that many states prefer senders to contact the remittance transfer provider before contacting a State agency for questions and complaints. The commenter believed that the Bureau should instead require a statement that would refer to other sources, such as a Web site or toll-free number, to obtain contact information for the appropriate State agency, and that the Bureau should maintain contact information for State agencies, so that senders could contact the Bureau for appropriate State agency information.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(ii)(II) requires a remittance transfer provider to provide appropriate contact information for the State agency that regulates the remittance transfer provider. The Bureau does not believe that providing contact information for an alternative source that maintains a list of State agencies would satisfy the statutory requirement. The Bureau recognizes that remittance transfer providers that have locations in multiple states, or that provide remittance transfers online or by telephone, will have to determine the appropriate State agency to disclose on a receipt. The Bureau believes that due to segregation and other formatting requirements, discussed below, a remittance transfer provider may not disclose contact information for agencies in other states. Therefore, the final rule maintains the requirement to disclose information regarding a State agency that regulates the remittance transfer provider.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>However, several changes are made in the final rule to clarify which State agency should be disclosed, because a remittance transfer provider may be regulated by more than one agency in a particular State. The Bureau believes that the statute is meant to provide senders a resource for addressing problems regarding a particular remittance transfer and that the State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider is the appropriate State agency to provide such assistance to senders. Thus, in § 1005.31(b)(2)(vi), the final rule adds the clarification that the disclosure must disclose the State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider with respect to the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Second, the Board requested comment on whether a remittance transfer provider should be required to disclose the contact information for the Bureau, including the toll-free telephone number, in cases where the Bureau is not the primary Federal regulator for consumer complaints against the remittance transfer provider. The Board also requested comment on whether it would be appropriate to instead require the contact information of the primary Federal regulator of the remittance transfer provider for consumer complaints.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters and an industry commenter stated that the Bureau's contact information should be included on the receipt. These commenters stated that listing the Bureau's contact information, rather than the primary Federal regulator, would ensure that consumer complaints about remittance transfer provider were centralized in one Federal agency. The commenter suggested that even if the Bureau does not directly regulate a remittance transfer provider, the Bureau could track complaints and launch an investigation if a pattern and practice of non-compliance emerges.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees that it is appropriate to provide the Bureau's contact information, even in instances where the Bureau is not the provider's primary Federal regulator, as required by EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(ii)(II)(bb). The Bureau believes that providing a single Federal agency as the appropriate contact for senders will assist in tracking complaints. The Bureau is not requiring a separate disclosure of a primary Federal regulator in the final rule, because the disclosure of multiple Federal agencies could confuse senders. Instead, the Bureau believes consumers are better served by contacting the Bureau, which can direct senders to the appropriate Federal agency as necessary. Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(2)(vi) in the final rule requires a remittance transfer provider to disclose the contact information for the Bureau, including the toll-free telephone number.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Board requested comment on whether financial institutions that are primarily regulated by Federal banking agencies, such as national banks, should be required to disclose State regulatory agency information. The Board requested comment regarding the circumstances in which it might be appropriate to disclose such a State regulatory agency.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters stated that the rule should only require Federally-chartered depository institutions to provide contact information for their primary Federal regulator. One industry commenter argued that providing information regarding State regulators would be confusing and ineffective, since its primary Federal regulator already has an established procedure for addressing errors.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes the final rule sufficiently accounts for circumstances in which an institution may not be licensed or chartered by a State agency. Under the final rule, the provider must disclose the State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider. However, disclosures must only be disclosed as applicable. Consequently, if no State agency licenses or charters a particular provider, then no State agency is required to be disclosed.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adding several other changes to § 1005.31(b)(2)(vi) in the final rule for clarity. The final rule adds language to allow providers to disclose more than one telephone number for the State agency that licenses or charters the provider and the Bureau to account for circumstances, for example, where these agencies maintain separate TTY/TDD telephone numbers. The provision also adds the requirement that a remittance transfer provider must disclose the name of both the State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider and the Bureau, in addition to the telephone number(s) and Web site of each agency.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(b)(2)(vi) of the final rule states that a remittance transfer must provide a statement that the sender can contact the State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider with respect to the remittance transfer and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for questions or complaints about the remittance transfer provider. The statement must use the language set forth in Model Form A-37 of Appendix A to this part or substantially similar language. The disclosure also must provide the name, telephone number(s), and Web site of the State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider with respect to the remittance transfer and the name, toll-free telephone number(s), and Web site of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(2)-2 has been added to the final rule to clarify that a remittance transfer provider must only disclose information about a State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider with respect to the remittance transfer, as applicable. For example, if a financial institution is solely regulated by a Federal agency, and not licensed or chartered by a State agency, then the institution need not disclose information about a State agency and would solely disclose information about the Bureau, whether or not the Bureau is the provider's primary Federal regulator.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The final rule also adds comment 31(b)(2)-3 to clarify that a remittance transfer provider must only disclose information about one State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider with respect to the remittance transfer, even if other State agencies also regulate the remittance transfer provider. For example, a provider may disclose information about the State agency which granted its license. If a provider is licensed in multiple states, and the State agency that licenses the provider with respect to the remittance transfer is determined by a sender's location, a provider may make the determination as to the State in which the sender is located based on information that is provided by the sender and on any records associated with the sender. For example, if the State agency that licenses the provider with respect to an online remittance transfer is determined by a sender's location, a provider could rely on the sender's statement regarding the State in which the sender is located and disclose the State agency that licenses the provider in that State. A State-chartered bank must disclose information about the State agency that granted its charter, regardless of the location of the sender.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>31(g)(2) Oral, Mobile Application or Text Message Disclosures</title>
      <analysisParagraph>In the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the Board proposed to use its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to exempt oral disclosures from the foreign language requirement under EFTA section 919(b). In proposed § 205.31(g)(2), the Board proposed to use its authority under EFTA section 919(a)(5)(A) to permit oral disclosures for transactions conducted entirety by telephone, subject to the requirement that they be made in the language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction. Proposed § 205.31(g)(2) also provided that disclosures permitted to be provided orally under proposed § 205.31(a)(4) for error resolution purposes must be made in the language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to assert the error.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters thought that the rule should not require disclosures in any foreign language that is not principally used to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers. These commenters suggested that such a requirement could hurt consumers by reducing the number of languages that a remittance transfer provider would be willing to use to conduct a transaction.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>However, as the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, if a foreign language must be principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers in order to trigger the foreign language requirement for oral disclosures, a sender conducting a transaction or asserting an error in a foreign language on the telephone that did not meet the foreign language advertising trigger may only receive required oral disclosures in English. Consequently, if the remittance transfer provider conducted the actual transaction or communicated with the sender regarding the alleged error in a foreign language, a remittance transfer provider could then switch to English to orally disclose the required information under such a rule. The Bureau believes that senders would benefit from having the required oral disclosures provided in the same language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction or assert the error, regardless of whether the language meets the foreign language advertising trigger. Failure to include this modification from the general foreign language requirement for oral disclosures could lead to consumers not understanding the required disclosures, which would be contrary to the goals and purposes of the statute.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, the Bureau agrees with the Board's reasoning in the May 2011 Proposed Rule that disclosures provided orally under § 1005.31(a)(3) and (4) should be provided only in the language primarily used to conduct the transaction or assert the error. Otherwise, under EFTA section 919(b), a sender conducting a telephone transaction orally or receiving the results of an error investigation orally could be given disclosures in English and in every foreign language triggered by the regulation, which would likely lead to consumer confusion. While the Bureau recognizes that this rule might reduce the languages in which a remittance transfer provider would be willing to conduct a transaction, the Bureau believes that applying the general foreign language disclosure rule to oral disclosures would be harmful to consumers for the reasons set forth above.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Moreover, as discussed above, the Bureau is adopting § 1005.31(a)(5) to permit disclosures to be provided orally or via mobile application or text message for transactions conducted entirely by telephone via mobile application or text message. Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to adopt proposed § 205.31(g)(2) in renumbered § 1005.31(g)(2) with amendments to include a reference to transactions conducted entirely by telephone via mobile application or text message and other minor, non-substantive amendments.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Written Receipt for Telephone Transactions</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Board also proposed § 205.31(g)(3), which provided that written receipts for transactions conducted entirely by telephone must be made in English and, if applicable, in the foreign language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction, regardless of whether such foreign language is primarily used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers. The Board, however, requested comment on whether the general rule proposed in § 205.31(g)(1) (adopted as § 1005.31(g)(1) above) should apply to the written receipt provided for transactions conducted entirely by telephone. Adopting the general rule proposed in § 205.31(g)(1) for written receipts provided for transactions conducted entirely by telephone would mean that a remittance transfer provider would not be obligated to provide the written receipt in a foreign language, even if such foreign language was used to conduct the telephone transaction, unless the foreign language was principally used to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers during the telephone call.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As noted above, some industry commenters thought that the rule should not require disclosures in any foreign language that is not principally used to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers because this might cause remittance transfer providers to reduce the number of languages they would be willing to use to conduct a remittance transfer. Another industry commenter stated that in its experience, consumers can understand written English even though they may prefer to conduct a transaction orally in their native language for the fluency, ease, and speed at which the transaction may be conducted when speaking in one's native language.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that applying the general rule under § 1005.31(g)(1) to written receipts provided to senders after payment would not cause the same type of consumer confusion as it would for pre-payment disclosures provided orally in transactions conducted entirely by telephone. Although some senders may not have enough familiarity with English to feel comfortable speaking with the remittance transfer provider in English, the same pressure to comprehend and respond quickly does not exist with written disclosures. Unlike with oral disclosures, senders have sufficient time to review written disclosures and, if necessary, find resources to help understand the disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, the Bureau notes that in the Board's outreach with industry, remittance transfer providers generally stated that providing written disclosures in a foreign language can be more costly and burdensome than providing oral disclosures in a foreign language. The Bureau also notes that a remittance transfer provider may have employees or agents that happen to speak a certain foreign language for which the provider does not have written disclosures. The Bureau would not want providers to discourage such employees or agents from using their foreign language skills to help senders with their remittance transfer transactions in order to avoid having to provide written disclosures in the language spoken by the employee or agent. In order to minimize the potential unintended consequence of having remittance transfer providers reduce the number of foreign languages they may offer for telephone transactions, the Bureau is not adopting proposed § 205.31(g)(3). Therefore, written receipts required to be provided to the sender after payment for transactions conducted entirely by telephone are subject to the general rule under § 1005.31(g)(1).</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>General Clarifications</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Board also proposed additional commentary in the May 2011 Proposed Rule to provide general guidance on issues that affect each of the subsections of proposed § 205.31(g) (adopted as § 1005.31(g)) discussed above. EFTA section 919(b) does not limit the number of languages that may be used on a single disclosure. However, proposed comment 31(g)-1 suggested that a single written or electronic document containing more than three languages is not likely to be helpful to a consumer. Since the proposed commentary was not a strict limit, the Board solicited comment on whether the regulation should strictly limit the number of languages that may be contained in a single written or electronic disclosure. The Board also sought comment on whether three languages is an appropriate suggested limit to the number of languages in a single written or electronic document.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter suggested that the rule cap the number of languages a remittance transfer provider would be required to disclose to three languages. The commenter also stated that requiring English, Spanish, and French would cover the vast majority of the languages used in transfers they send from the United States. This commenter also noted that other regulators that have required foreign language disclosures have typically limited the languages that must be disclosed to either English and Spanish, or a small subset of languages such as Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, and Korean. A consumer group commenter recommended that rather than adopting a ceiling on the number of languages that may appear on a disclosure, the Bureau should create guidelines that ensure disclosures with multiple foreign languages are easy to understand.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe that limiting the foreign languages that may be used by a remittance transfer provider best effectuates the goals of the statute. In the Bureau's view, if a remittance transfer provider principally uses a foreign language to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers at an office, the remittance transfer provider is deliberately reaching out to consumers speaking that foreign language, and the required disclosures should be provided in that foreign language, regardless of whether it is a language that is commonly used for remittance transfers originating in the United States. Furthermore, while too many languages on a single written document may diminish a consumer's ability to read and understand the disclosures, the Bureau believes that remittance transfer providers may find ways to present the information in a number of foreign languages that are clear and conspicuous to senders, and that imposing a definitive limit on the number of languages that may appear on a single disclosure may be too inflexible. Moreover, the Bureau believes that the formatting requirements in § 1005.31(c), as discussed above, may help to ensure that senders can find and understand the information that is most important to them with respect to the remittance transfer. The Bureau is amending comment 31(g)-1 to note that disclosures must be clear and conspicuous pursuant to § 1005.31(a)(1) without suggesting a specific limit on the number of languages in a single disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(g)-1 also clarified that the remittance transfer provider may provide disclosures in a single document with both languages or in two separate documents with one document in English and the other document in the applicable foreign language. The Board also proposed several examples in comment 31(g)-1 to illustrate the application of this concept.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters thought that senders should be able to designate the language in which they prefer to receive disclosures, provided it is a language that is principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers, instead of providing disclosures in both English and the applicable foreign language. The Bureau notes that EFTA section 919(b) requires disclosures to be provided in English and in each of the foreign languages principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market at that office. This means that regardless of which office a sender chooses to conduct a remittance transfer, he or she will always obtain written or electronic disclosures in English, even if the disclosure in a foreign language is not consistent among different offices because such disclosure will depend on whether the foreign language meets the foreign language disclosure trigger at that office. The Bureau believes that always disclosing in English is important to allow senders to compare disclosures received at different provider locations and for different providers. Therefore, the final rule requires remittance transfer providers to provide disclosures in English in all cases. This is fully consistent with EFTA section 919(b). Comment 31(g)-1 is adopted as proposed with some technical and clarifying amendments, including to remove references to § 205.31(g)(3), consistent with the Bureau's decision regarding written receipts for telephone transactions, as discussed above.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Board also proposed comment 31(g)-2 to clarify when a language is primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct a transaction and assert an error. A remittance transfer provider must determine the language that is primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct a transaction or assert an error if the provider chooses to provide written or electronic disclosures in English and the foreign language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction or to assert an error. Furthermore, under § 1005.31(g)(2), a remittance transfer provider is required to provide oral disclosures in the language that is primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction or assert an error.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Specifically, proposed comment 31(g)-2 clarified that the language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction is the primary language used to convey the information necessary to complete the transaction. Proposed comment 31(g)-2 also stated that the language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to assert an error is the primary language used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to provide the information required by § 1005.33(b) to assert an error. The proposed comment also provided examples to clarify this concept.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter suggested that the foreign language disclosure requirement should relate to the language used by the remittance transfer provider, rather than the language used by the sender. Some industry commenters recommended that the Bureau provide further clarification of the term “primarily used” without specifying what type of guidance would be helpful. The Bureau notes that proposed comment 31(g)-2 specifies that the relevant foreign language is the foreign language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct a transaction or assert an error, and the examples show that a foreign language must be used by both the sender and the remittance transfer provider to be primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct a transaction or assert an error. The Bureau believes the proposed commentary is clear on this point. However, as additional clarification, the Bureau is including a new example in comment 31(g)-2 to illustrate when a sender primarily uses a foreign language with a remittance transfer provider in the internet context.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Storefront and Internet Disclosures</title>
        <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(6)(A) states that the Bureau may prescribe rules to require a remittance transfer provider to prominently post, and timely update, a notice describing a model remittance transfer for one or more amounts. The provision states that such a notice shall show the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient, using the values of the currency into which the funds will be exchanged. EFTA section 919(a)(6)(A) also states that the Bureau may require the notice prescribed to be displayed in every physical storefront location owned or controlled by the remittance transfer provider. Further, EFTA section 919(a)(6)(A) states that the Bureau shall prescribe rules to require a remittance transfer provider that provides remittance transfers via the internet to provide a notice, comparable to the storefront notice described in the statute, located on the home page or landing page (with respect to such remittance transfer services) owned or controlled by the remittance transfer provider.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(6)(B) states that, prior to proposing rules under EFTA section 919(a)(6)(A), appropriate studies and analyses must be performed to determine whether a storefront notice or internet notice facilitates the ability of a consumer to: (i) Compare prices for remittance transfers, and (ii) understand the types and amounts of any fees or costs imposed on remittance transfers. The studies and analyses must be consistent with EFTA section 904(a)(2), which requires an economic impact analysis that considers the costs and benefits of a regulation to financial institutions, consumers, and other users. These costs and benefits include the extent to which additional paperwork would be required, the effects upon competition in the provision of services among large and small financial institutions, and the availability of services to different classes of consumers, particularly low income consumers.<footnote ref="78">As discussed below, the Board performed an analysis in the proposed rule consistent with EFTA section 904(a)(2), as it existed prior to any amendments in the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 904(a)(2), however, did not apply and was not amended by the Dodd-Frank Act to apply to the Bureau. Regardless, the Board's analysis from the proposal is unchanged, and the Bureau concurs with the Board's analysis.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consistent with EFTA section 919(a)(6)(B), the Board reviewed and analyzed the statute and a variety of independent articles, studies, and Congressional testimony; conducted outreach with industry and consumer advocates; and held focus groups with consumers who send remittance transfers. Based on its findings, summarized below, the Board concluded in the May 2011 Proposed Rule that the statutory notice would not facilitate a consumer's ability to compare prices or to understand the fees and costs imposed on remittance transfers.<footnote ref="79">A complete discussion of the Board's findings is available at 76 FR at 29924-29927.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The notice described by the statute illustrates only the exchange rate offered by that remittance transfer provider for the particular model transfer amount. In addition to the exchange rate, however, the total cost of a remittance transfer includes fees charged by the remittance transfer provider, any intermediary in the transfer, and the receiving entity. The total cost also includes any taxes that may be charged in the sending and receiving jurisdictions. Thus, the Board determined the statutory storefront notice would not present a complete picture to the consumer of all potential fees and costs for a remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In the proposal, the Board considered two alternatives to the type of notice described in the statute that could more effectively communicate costs to a sender. The Board considered requiring the posting of transfer fee information for model send amounts, but believed that this alternative notice would have many of the same limitations as the statutory notice. The Board also considered requiring a notice that would reflect all the costs of a transfer. A notice with this alternative content could help consumers to obtain a better understanding of the total cost of a remittance transfer, but the length and complexity of such notices could limit their utility.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The analysis conducted by the Board identified other limitations with both the statutory and alternative storefront disclosures. First, most consumers would be unable to apply the information provided by the statutory notice to their own transfers. The fees, exchange rate, and taxes for a remittance transfer can vary based upon the amount sent, transfer corridor (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the sending location to the receiving location), speed of transfer (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> the next day, the same day, or in one hour), method of delivery (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> an electronic deposit into a bank account or a cash disbursement), and type of receiving entity (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> a bank or a money transmitter's payout partner). For example, some remittance transfer providers offer a discount on their exchange rate spread for large send amounts. Therefore, even if the consumer's transfer were identical to the model transfer posted in the storefront notice except for the send amount, the consumer still may be unable to determine the exchange rate that would apply to the consumer's transfer based on the storefront notice.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Moreover, a consumer could be overwhelmed by the amount of data appearing in a long, complex storefront notice posted by these providers and, therefore, might not use it. A storefront notice for sending a specified amount to a single country could contain multiple rows of information to account for differences in pricing based on the transfer method, timing option, receipt location, and cost permutations described above. Many providers offer remittance transfers to multiple countries, and several locations within each country, which would multiply the number of data points on the notice.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, frequent fluctuations in exchange rates could result in disclosures being inaccurate for a period of time. Remittance transfer providers would have to update the storefront notice for each send location several times a week, or as frequently as several times a day, to account for the fluctuations in exchange rates. These rates could also be different at a single provider's different send locations. Remittance transfer providers would need to distribute the updated notices to each send location, and each send location would need to replace the outdated notice just as frequently. Non-exclusive send locations that offer the services of two or more money transmitters would have to post and update the storefront notices for each remittance transfer provider. As a result, a storefront notice could be unhelpful and even misleading to consumers, while creating unnecessary legal risks for remittance transfer providers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The analysis also identified potential effects that the storefront notice requirement would have on competition and costs to the consumer. The work involved in posting and updating storefront notices could cause some agents to stop offering remittance transfers. Further, credit unions and small banks that infrequently conduct transfers could find the burden and cost of producing storefront notices prohibitive and discontinue the service. Given the costs and risks associated with posting and updating the storefront notices contemplated by the statute, some providers could decide to exit the market, which could reduce competition among providers and increase costs for consumers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Because the Board did not propose a rule mandating the posting of storefront notices, it did not propose a rule mandating the posting of internet notices. Since the proposal did not require a storefront notice, there could be no “comparable” internet notice. Moreover, the Board's study of model internet notices indicated that consumers using internet remittance transfer providers to request remittance transfers would be less likely to use a model transfer notice than those using providers at a physical location. Many internet providers currently disclose transaction-specific information prior to the consumer's payment for a transfer, and § 1005.31(b)(1), discussed above, makes this practice a regulatory requirement.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters supported the findings that the storefront notice and internet notice would not be useful to consumers. One consumer group commenter believed that the Bureau should require any storefront advertising to be in a storefront disclosure format prescribed by the Bureau. The commenter argued that the storefront disclosure should include the amount a sender pays to a remittance transfer provider and the amount to be received by a recipient for at least two sample amounts. The commenter suggested that disclosures could be based on the cost at a certain time, such as the previous business day, to alleviate the concerns about disclosures needing to be updated more frequently.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with the Board's analysis, and believes that the storefront and internet disclosures described in EFTA section 919(a)(6)(A) would not accomplish the statutory goals of facilitating the ability of consumers to compare prices for remittance transfers and to understand the types and amounts of any fees or costs imposed on remittance transfers. The disclosures would not provide a complete disclosure of all of the costs of a remittance transfer. Even if all costs were provided in the disclosures, consumers would be unable to extrapolate from a storefront disclosure the cost of their particular transaction, because the cost could depend on other variables. The Bureau also recognizes the burden on remittance transfer providers could be significant and could lead some providers to no longer provide remittance services. The burden on providers would be substantial even if the disclosures were only required to be updated daily. Moreover, requiring less frequent updating would result in the disclosures being inaccurate for a period of time.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Because the cost to providers could be substantial, and the benefit of the storefront and internet disclosures would be minimal, the final rule does not require the posting of model remittance transfer notices at a storefront or on the internet.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D) contains a descriptive, general definition of the term “prepaid account” that largely preserves the structure of the proposed definition, with an increased focus on the account's functionality for greater clarity. The provision builds on elements of proposed § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(A) and (B), which focused on whether an account was issued to a consumer on a prepaid basis or was capable of being loaded with funds thereafter and whether the account was redeemable upon presentation at multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, usable at ATMs, or usable for P2P transfers. To constitute a prepaid account under final § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D), an account must satisfy all three of the prongs of final § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) through (<em data-original="E-03">3</em>), which are discussed in turn below.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(b)(3) Short Form Disclosure of Variable Fees and Third-Party Fees and Prohibition on Disclosure of Finance Charges</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(C) would have set forth how, within the confines of the proposed short form disclosure, financial institutions could disclose fees that may vary. As noted in the proposal and above, in many instances, prepaid accounts may have certain fees that vary depending on how a consumer uses the account. The proposal gave the example of monthly periodic fees that are, for some prepaid account programs, waived when a consumer receives direct deposit or when the monthly balance exceeds a certain amount. The Bureau was concerned that in some instances, these conditional situations could become complicated and difficult to explain on a short form disclosure, particularly for multiple fees. The Bureau believed that allowing multiple, complex disclaimers on a single form would be complicated and make comprehension and comparisons more difficult.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Thus, the Bureau proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(C), which would have provided that if the amount of the fee that a financial institution imposes for each of the fee types disclosed pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B) could vary, a financial institution must disclose the highest fee it could impose on a consumer for utilizing the service associated with the fee, along with a symbol, such as an asterisk, to indicate that a lower fee might apply, and text explaining that the fee could be lower, in a form substantially similar to the clause set forth in the proposed Model Forms A-10(a) through (d). Proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(C) would have also stated that a financial institution must use the same symbol and text for all fees that could be lower, but may use any other part of the prepaid account product's packaging material or its Web site to provide more detail about how a specific fee type may be lower. Proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(C) would have further stated that a financial institution must not disclose any additional third-party fees imposed in connection with any of the fees disclosed pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) through (<em data-original="E-03">8</em>).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(C)-1 would have provided examples of how to disclose variable fees on the short form disclosure in accordance with proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(C). The proposed comment would have also clarified that proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(C) does not permit a financial institution to explain the conditions under which a fee may be lower, but a financial institution could use any other part of the prepaid account product's packaging material or may use its Web site to disclose that information. That information would also have been required to be disclosed in the long form pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii)(A). Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(C)-2 would have explained that third parties could include service providers and other entities, regardless of whether the entity is an agent of the financial institution. The Bureau believed that, regardless of whether a third party has a relationship with the financial institution, no additional fees should be disclosed on the short form.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau recognized that its proposed approach to the disclosure of variable fees on the short form could potentially obscure some complexity in a prepaid account's fee structure. The Bureau, however, proposed to require that this information be disclosed on the long form, pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii)(A) and to permit its disclosure outside the confines of the short form to mitigate any risk of confusion. The Bureau believed that the proposed short form disclosure—and the requirement to disclose the highest fee with an indication that the fee may be lower in certain circumstances—would allow consumers to know the maximum they will pay for that fee type while indicating to consumers when they could qualify for a lower fee.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Comments regarding disclosure of variable fees.</em> A number of industry commenters, including industry trade associations, program managers, issuing banks, a payment network, and a law firm writing on behalf of a coalition of prepaid issuers, as well as several State government agencies and a think tank, recommended that the Bureau eliminate the requirement to disclose the highest fee for a fee that varies in favor of more fulsome disclosure of the price variations for that fee. They said disclosing the highest fee, with a symbol linked to a statement explaining that the fee may be lower depending on how and where the prepaid account is used, would mislead consumers by failing to provide them with information critical to making meaningful decisions, such as more detailed information within the short form on how they can take advantage of fee waivers and discounts. Some industry commenters said it would be counterintuitive for consumers to check other areas of the packaging for such discounts and pointed to confusion over the asterisk in the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing as indicating the Bureau's proposed system would not work. One trade association added that required disclosure of the highest fee would restrict fee models and limit innovation.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Many of these industry commenters recommended alternatives to disclosure of the highest fee, such as permitting disclosure in the short form of the full variation of fees or requiring disclosure of the highest fee only if the issuer chooses not to disclose the fee variations. Others recommended disclosing the most common, highest and lowest, lower end, median, or a range of fees. Some recommended disclosing a graphic showing the proportion of consumers paying the highest fee or permitting a de minimis exception allowing disclosure of a lower fee if that lower price is within a close range of the highest fee. Two consumer groups specifically addressed this portion of the proposal, praising the Bureau for the short form disclosure's balance between simplicity and completeness, and saying that too much information reduces consumer understanding. One of the commenters stated that it is important for the consumer to know the highest fee, that financial institutions have alternative places to highlight how to avoid a higher fee, and that disclosing the highest fee also encourages consumers to turn to the long form disclosure to find out about fee waivers and discounts. The other consumer group commenter stated that the required disclosure of the highest fee may encourage lowering fees but could also mislead consumers regarding the actual cost of a feature, particularly with regard to the cash reload fee, suggesting that the required disclosure of the highest fee may provide an incentive to industry to eliminate discounts, such as waiver of the periodic fee with direct deposit. This commenter suggested that the Bureau monitor and assess the impact of requiring disclosure of the highest fee.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters, including an issuing bank and a trade association specifically recommended permitting inclusion in the short form disclosure of the conditions under which the monthly fee could be waived, citing the importance of this fee and the prevalence of discounts and waivers applicable to this fee as crucial to consumer decisions in choosing a prepaid card. A consumer group said its research showed that 14 of 66 prepaid cards disclose that the monthly fee can be waived entirely if the consumer takes certain actions.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Comments regarding single disclosure of like fees.</em> Some commenters recommended permitting a single disclosure in the short form in place of required two-tier fees, <em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> those provisions requiring disclosure of two fee variations under a single fee or fee type, when the fee amount is the same for both fees. As noted above, two trade associations, an issuing bank, and the office of a State Attorney General made this recommendation specifically for the per purchase fee disclosure that would have been required under proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(2) (final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii) requires disclosure of a single per purchase fee) and a program manager made this recommendation for the ATM withdrawal fees under proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(3).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Comments regarding disclosure of third-party fees.</em> Several industry commenters, including issuing banks and an industry trade association commented on the Bureau's proposal to prohibit the disclosure of third-party fees in the short form. The trade association and two issuing banks generally recommended against mandating disclosure of third-party fees as impractical because, they said, the amount of the fees and the timing and frequency of changes to the fees is often outside the control of the financial institution. Specifically regarding the short form, they recommended permitting a general disclaimer regarding third-party fees or an example to show when such a fee may occur. Another issuing bank recommended that third-party fees should be permitted, but not required, to be disclosed in the short form. Comments related to disclosure of third-party fees in the short form specifically for cash reloads are addressed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(2)(iv) above. In that particular circumstance, some commenters expressed concern that failing to reflect third-party fees in connection with the proposed disclosure of the cash reload fee in the short form might create consumer confusion given that it is a standard industry practice for reload network providers or third-party retailers, not the financial institutions that issue prepaid accounts, to provide and charge for the reloading of cash into prepaid accounts. In addition to confusing consumers, commenters suggested this outcome would result in a competitive disadvantage for financial institutions that offer proprietary systems, which are usually less expensive than third-party systems, and thereby dissuade financial institutions from offering this service.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Comments regarding disclosure of finance charges.</em> Although the Bureau did not specifically solicit comment on disclosure in the short form of finance charges, several consumer group commenters addressed this issue in their comments regarding the proposed statement on overdraft credit features. As discussed above, these consumer groups recommended that the Bureau require disclosure in the short form of the actual fees charged for overdraft credit features, which one consumer group said would otherwise permit the issuer to hide the ball by calling such fees by other names. The Bureau received no comments from industry specifically about disclosure of finance charges in the short form disclosure.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(C), renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(3), with certain modifications. While the Bureau is adopting the proposed requirement to disclose the highest fee when the amount of a fee can vary in final § 1005.18(b)(3)(i), it is also adopting new § 1005.18(b)(3)(ii) to give financial institutions the option to disclose more detailed fee waiver or discount information specifically for the periodic fee required to be disclosed by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(i).<footnote ref="447">See final comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(C)-1 for specific guidance regarding disclosure of fee variations in additional fee types.</footnote>
             In addition, the Bureau is adopting new § 1005.18(b)(3)(iii) permitting, as an alternative to certain two-tier fee disclosures, disclosure of a single fee amount when the amount is the same for both fees. With regard to third-party fees, the Bureau is adopting in new § 1005.18(b)(3)(iv) a more explicit general prohibition on inclusion of third-party fees in the short form disclosure, while also providing more detail in new § 1005.18(b)(3)(v) with regard to the special provision in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(iv) to include third-party cash reload fees. Final § 1005.18(b)(3)(vi) prohibits disclosure in the short form of finance charges as described in Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11) imposed in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in § 1026.61.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau has made technical modifications to the rule and related commentary for conformity and clarity and, for the reasons set forth below, the Bureau has revised proposed comments 18(b)(2)(i)(C)-1 and 2, renumbered as 18(b)(3)(i)-1 and 18(b)(3)(iv)-1, respectively, and has added new comments 18(b)(3)(ii)-1, 18(b)(3)(iii)-1, 18(b)(3)(v)-1, and 18(b)(3)(vi)-1 to provide additional clarification and guidance regarding the requirements set forth in final § 1005.18(b)(3).</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Disclosure of Variable Fees Generally and for the Periodic Fee</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.18(b)(3)(i) generally provides that if the amount of any fee that is required to be disclosed in the short form disclosure could vary, a financial institution shall disclose the highest amount it may impose for that fee, followed by a symbol, such as an asterisk, linked to a statement explaining that the fee could be lower depending on how and where the prepaid account is used, using the following clause or a substantially similar clause: “This fee can be lower depending on how and where this card is used.” Except as provided in final § 1005.18(b)(3)(ii), a financial institution must use the same symbol and statement for all fees that could vary. The linked statement must be located above the statement required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(x). As discussed in more detail below, final rule § 1005.18(b)(3)(ii) provides an alternative for periodic fees disclosed pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) where a financial institution can disclose either the asterisk statement pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(3)(i) or can disclose specific information about fee waiver or reduction for the periodic fee.
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above in connection with the periodic fee disclosure under § 1005.18(b)(2)(i), the Bureau acknowledges the concerns expressed by commenters regarding the need to provide more information about how such fees can vary. However, for the reasons discussed below, the Bureau believes that providing the same level of tailoring and detail with regard to all other fees on the short form would substantially increase the complexity of the form and decrease its usefulness to consumers as an introductory overview of account pricing. Accordingly, the Bureau believes that the best balance is to allow more flexibility with regard to periodic fees while maintaining the proposal's approach to variations in other fees. The Bureau continues to believe that information on fee variations for all other fees could not be disclosed in a manner that is both engaging and comprehensible to consumers. The design of the short form disclosure seeks a balance between the disclosure of key information necessary for consumer purchase and use decisions and the brevity and clarity necessary for optimal consumer comprehension and engagement. Incorporating into the short form disclosure multiple complex disclaimers, often featuring a variety of conditions under which consumers may receive fee waivers or discounts or obtain fee waivers or discounts for a certain time period, would disrupt this balance.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Further, many of the alternatives recommended by commenters, such as disclosing a range of fees or using a graphic to show the proportion of consumers paying the highest fees, posed a degree of complexity the Bureau also believes would disrupt this balance. In addition, as opposed to alternatives recommended by commenters such as disclosing the median, lowest, or most common fee, the Bureau believes, as stated in the proposal, it is paramount for consumers to know the maximum they could pay for a particular fee. In this way, consumers will not be surprised by being charged fees higher than they expected and, as pointed out by a consumer group commenter, the linked statement can incent consumers to turn to other sources to learn about available discounts and waivers. As the Bureau explained in the proposal, financial institutions have the alternative of explaining these fee variations elsewhere, such as on other parts of the packaging or on their Web sites. In addition, financial institutions must disclose these details in the long form disclosure pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii), discussed below. The Bureau believes that once the standardized short form disclosure is used by all prepaid account programs, it will not be counterintuitive, as asserted by some industry commenters, to look outside of its contours for additional information like fee waivers and discounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In response to the consumer group commenter raising concerns and recommending that the Bureau monitor and assess the impact of requiring disclosure of the highest fee, the Bureau notes that the commenters' concerns regarding disclosure of periodic fees and fees for cash reloads are specifically addressed in the final rule, respectively, by § 1005.18(b)(3)(ii) and (v). Also, the Bureau intends to continue to monitor the issues addressed in this rule, including disclosure of the highest fee.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In response to the industry commenter citing to the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing as indicating that the proposed system for disclosing fee variation with an asterisk linked to a generic statement that fees could be lower would confuse consumers, the cited testing actually revealed the opposite: Participants were confused by multiple asterisks linked to the details of fee variations for specific fees. The Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing supports adoption of the proposed system in that, although some misconceptions persisted, most participants understood the significance of the presence or absence of the asterisk when linked to fees other than the monthly fee.<footnote ref="448">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report II at 10-11 and 21.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, some commenters recommended that the Bureau permit fuller fee disclosure in the short form for waivers and discounts of the monthly fee. The Bureau recognizes that the monthly fee is a key fee and is one of the most commonly waived or discounted prepaid account fees. The Bureau understands such waivers and discounts are based on the consumer meeting one or a combination of the following conditions: Having direct deposit into the prepaid account, making a set number of transactions per month, or loading a minimum amount of money per month into the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau followed up on this issue in its post-proposal consumer testing. In addition to an asterisk linking the highest fees to a statement indicating the fee can be lower depending on how and where the card is used, the Bureau also tested adding a dagger symbol (†) after the highest fee disclosed for the periodic fee, linked to an additional line of text located above the asterisked statement, describing variations in the monthly fee due to waivers and discounts when certain conditions are met.<footnote ref="449">See ICF Report II at apps. B and C for copies of the prototype short form disclosures tested.</footnote>
             The Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing examined participant comprehension of various versions of the language and in various scenarios.<footnote ref="450">Participants variously examined a single prototype short form in isolation, compared two prototype short forms with differing versions of the dagger language, and compared one prototype short form that included dagger language to a short form that did not include dagger language (but which did link the monthly fee to the more generic asterisk statement). &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report II at 11 and 21-22.</footnote>
             Most participants who saw the form with the dagger language correctly linked the dagger to the associated text and understood that the circumstances under which the monthly fee could be waived and most participants who saw the form with only the generic asterisk language linked to the monthly fee correctly linked the asterisk to the associated text and understood the monthly fee could be lower in some situations.<footnote ref="451">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt; In addition to successfully following the dagger symbol to the appropriate text, some participants also linked the monthly fee to the text associated with the more generic asterisk language which, while applicable, was not intended.</footnote>
             Thus, regardless of the version shown, all participants understood that the monthly fee could be waived in some situations, and all were able to correctly identify those situations.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The primacy of the periodic fee, prevalence of fee variations associated with the periodic fee, successful consumer testing of disclosure of fee variation for the monthly fee, and both industry and consumer group comments suggesting particular consideration regarding disclosure of the periodic fee have led the Bureau to adopt new § 1005.18(b)(3)(ii), which permits financial institutions an alternative disclosure for a periodic fee that may vary. Specifically, if the amount of the periodic fee disclosed in the short form disclosure pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) could vary, as an alternative to the disclosure required by final § 1005.18(b)(3)(i), the financial institution may disclose the highest amount it may impose for the periodic fee, followed by a symbol, such as a dagger, that is different from the symbol the financial institution uses pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(3)(i), to indicate that a waiver of the fee or a lower fee might apply, linked to a statement in one additional line of text disclosing the waiver or reduced fee amount and explaining the circumstances under which the fee waiver or reduction may occur. The linked statement must be located directly above or in place of the linked statement required by final § 1005.18(b)(3)(i), as applicable.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that this optional addition to the short form disclosure will help consumers better understand nuances regarding this important fee without serious compromise to the overall integrity of the short form design, especially in light of the reduction of information disclosed in the short form pursuant to the final rule. <em data-original="E-03">See, e.g.,</em> removal of two-tiered fees from § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii), reduction of three incidence-based fees to two additional fee types disclosed pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix), and permitted single disclosure for like fees pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(3)(iii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Final comment 18(b)(3)(i)-1 provides an example illustrating the general disclosure requirements of variable fees pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(3)(i). The comment also explains that, except as described in final § 1005.18(b)(3)(ii), final § 1005.18(b)(3)(i) does not permit a financial institution to describe in the short form disclosure the specific conditions under which a fee may be reduced or waived, but the financial institution could use, for example, any other part of the prepaid account's packaging or other printed materials to disclose that information. The comment also explains that the conditions under which a fee may be lower are required to be disclosed in the long form disclosure pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 18(b)(3)(ii)-1 explains that, if the amount of the periodic fee disclosed in the short form pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) could vary, a financial institution has two alternatives for disclosing the variation, as set forth in final § 1005.18(b)(3)(i) and (ii), and provides an illustrative example of both alternatives.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Single Disclosure of Like Fees</title>
        <analysisParagraph>In new § 1005.18(b)(3)(iii), the final rule provides that, as an alternative to the two-tier fee disclosures required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(iii), (v), and (vi) and any two-tier fee required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix), a financial institution may disclose a single fee amount when the amount is the same for both fees. New comment 18(b)(3)(iii)-1 provides examples illustrating how to provide a single disclosure for like fees on both the short form disclosure and the multiple service plan short form disclosure. The Bureau believes that permitting disclosure of a single fee amount for a two-tier fee disclosure where the same fee is charged for both variations creates efficiency by simplifying and shortening the short form disclosure without sacrificing consumer comprehension. The Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing confirmed that, for example, participants shown a short form with a single ATM withdrawal fee seemed to understand that the company providing the prepaid account would not charge different fees depending on what network the cardholder used.<footnote ref="452">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report II at 13-14.</footnote>

        <title>Disclosure of Third-Party Fees</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth in herein, the Bureau is adopting the proposed general prohibition on inclusion of third-party fees in the short form explicitly in its own provision of the final rule in § 1005.18(b)(3)(iv). Specifically, final § 1005.18(b)(3)(iv) states that, except as provided in final § 1005.18(b)(3)(v) with regard to cash reload fees, a financial institution may not include any third-party fees in a disclosure made pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2). New comment 18(b)(3)(iv)-1 explains that fees imposed by another party, such as a program manager, for services performed on behalf of the financial institution are not third-party fees and therefore must be disclosed pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(3)(iv). For example, if a program manager performs customer service functions for a financial institution's prepaid account program, and charges a fee for live agent customer service, that fee must be disclosed pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(3)(iv).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau received several comments in support of the Bureau's proposed exclusion of third-party fees from the short form disclosure. In response to the comments recommending that additional information or disclaimers be provided in the short form with regard to third-party fees, the Bureau believes that the abridged nature of the short form disclosure cannot accommodate disclosing all variable and third-party fees and that the comprehensive design of the long form disclosure is better suited to inform consumers about the details of fee variations and third-party fees. See the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(2)(iv) above, the Bureau is requiring disclosure in the short form of third-party fees for cash reloads. This requirement is principally set forth in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(iv), and is supplemented by new § 1005.18(b)(3)(v). Final § 1005.18(b)(3)(v) provides that any third-party fee included in the cash reload fee disclosed in the short form pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(iv) must be the highest fee known by the financial institution at the time it prints, or otherwise prepares, the short form disclosure required by final § 1005.18(b)(2). A financial institution is not required to revise its short form disclosure to reflect a cash reload fee change by a third party until such time that the financial institution manufactures, prints, or otherwise produces new prepaid account packaging materials or otherwise updates the short form disclosure. Thus, whether for a prepaid account program with packaging material or for one with only online or oral disclosures, the financial institution must update the short form to disclose a third-party cash reload fee change when it otherwise updates its short form disclosure. New comment 18(b)(3)(v)-1 provides several examples illustrating when a financial institution must update its short form disclosure to reflect a change in a third-party cash reload fee.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As explained in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(2)(iv) above, the Bureau believes it is important to disclose cash reload fees for proprietary and non-proprietary cash reload systems alike. However, the Bureau does not believe it would be appropriate to require financial institutions to reprint or otherwise reissue their short form disclosures whenever a third party changes its fees for cash reloads, as the financial institution may not always have control over when a third party changes its fees. Rather, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to require financial institutions to update the disclosure of these third-party fees when the financial institution manufactures, prints, or otherwise produces new packaging materials or until such time that the financial institution otherwise updates the short form disclosure.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Prohibition on Disclosure of Finance Charges</title>
        <analysisParagraph>In new § 1005.18(b)(3)(vi), the final rule provides that a financial institution may not include in a disclosure made pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (ix) any finance charges as described in Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11) imposed in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in § 1026.61. New comment 18(b)(3)(vi)-1 explains that if a financial institution imposes a higher fee or charge on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card than the amount of a comparable fee or charge it imposes on any prepaid account in the same prepaid account program that does not have such a credit feature, it must disclose on the short form for purposes of § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (vii) and (ix) the amount of the comparable fee rather than the higher fee. This comment also cross-references final § 1005.18(g)(2) and related commentary.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail above, the Bureau has made a strategic decision to focus the bulk of the short form disclosure on usage of the prepaid account itself (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the asset feature of the prepaid account). The possibility that consumers may be offered an overdraft credit feature for use in connection with the prepaid account is addressed in the short form pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(x), which requires the following statement if such a feature may be offered: “You may be offered overdraft/credit after [x] days. Fees would apply.” The Bureau believes this statement, informing consumers whether an overdraft credit feature is offered for the particular prepaid account and, if so, the conditionality of the feature, the duration of the mandatory waiting period, and that fees would apply, is sufficient information for consumers for the purposes of the short form. The Bureau believes inclusion of finance charges in the short form fee disclosures would confuse consumers, obfuscating information about the fees that the Bureau believes are most important to consumers when shopping for a prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Thus, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to exclude any finance charges related to an overdraft credit feature that may be offered at a later date to some prepaid consumers from general disclosure on the short form, including in the disclosures regarding additional fee types under both final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii) and (ix). If consumers are interested in such a feature, they can look to the Regulation Z disclosures in the long form pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(4)(vii) (as well as the main fee disclosure pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) for finance charges imposed on the asset features of the prepaid account), discussed below, for more details.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(b)(2) Short Form Disclosure Content</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(b)(2) would have consisted solely of a heading, with the substantive content requirements for the Bureau's proposed prepaid account pre-acquisition disclosure regime located under proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) for the short form disclosure and proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii) for the long form disclosure. The regulatory text of proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) would have consisted of a general statement that would have required that the fees, information, and notices that would have been set forth in the regulatory provisions under proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) be provided in the short form disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has relocated the regulatory text and commentary from proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) to the final rule in § 1005.18(b)(2) (with certain modifications as discussed below).<footnote ref="385">See the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b) above for a general discussion of the reorganization of the final rule.</footnote>
             In keeping with this relocation, the discussion of the Bureau's proposal and comments received regarding the regulatory text and comments of proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) are incorporated into this section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(2) (except the overall description of the proposed short form disclosure, which can be found in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b) above).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) would have required that, before a consumer acquires a prepaid account, a financial institution provide a short form disclosure containing specific information about the prepaid account, including certain notices, fees, and other information, as applicable.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)-1 would have explained what a provider should disclose on the short form when fees are inapplicable to a particular prepaid account product or are $0. Specifically, the proposed comment would have said that the disclosures required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) must always be provided prior to prepaid account acquisition, even when a particular disclosure is not applicable to a specific prepaid account. The proposed comment would have also provided an example that if a financial institution does not charge a fee to a consumer for withdrawing money at an ATM in the financial institution's network or an affiliated network, which is a type of fee that would have been required to be disclosed pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>), the financial institution should list “ATM withdrawal (in network)” on the short form disclosure and list “$0” as the fee. Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)-1 would have further clarified, however, that if the financial institution does not allow a consumer to withdraw money from ATMs that are in the financial institution's network or from those in an affiliated network, it should still list “ATM withdrawal (in-network)” and “ATM withdrawal (out-of-network)” on the short form disclosure and state “not offered” or “N/A.” The Bureau believed it important that the static portion of the short form disclosure list identical account features and fee types across all prepaid account products, to create standardization in order to enable consumers to quickly determine and compare the potential cost of certain offered features.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)-2 to further explain how to disclose fees and features on the short form disclosure. Specifically, the proposed comment would have explained that no more than two fees may be disclosed for each fee type required to be listed by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), (<em data-original="E-03">3</em>), and (<em data-original="E-03">5</em>) in the short form disclosure (that is, the per purchase fee, the ATM withdrawal fee, and the ATM balance inquiry fee), and that only one fee may be disclosed for each fee type required to be disclosed by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>), (<em data-original="E-03">4</em>), (<em data-original="E-03">6</em>), (<em data-original="E-03">7</em>), and (<em data-original="E-03">8</em>) (that is, the periodic fee, the cash reload fee, the customer service fee, the inactivity fee, and the incidence-based fees). The proposed comment would have clarified, however, that proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">8</em>) would have required the disclosure of up to three additional fee types. Finally, the proposed comment would have provided the example that, if a financial institution offers more than one method for loading cash into a prepaid account, only the fee for the method that will charge the highest fee should be disclosed, and the financial institution may use an asterisk or other symbol next to the cash reload fee disclosed to indicate that the fee may be lower. Finally, the proposed comment would have provided a cross-reference to proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(C)-1.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As the Bureau explained in the proposal, the Bureau believed that simplicity and clarity are important goals for the short form disclosure, particularly in light of the space constraints imposed in retail settings. Insofar as allowing complicated explanations and multiple different fees to be disclosed for a particular feature could disrupt those goals, the Bureau thus proposed that for most fees on the short form, a financial institution only be permitted to list one fee—the highest fee a consumer could incur for a particular activity. The Bureau noted that these limitations would only apply to the short form disclosure; the financial institution could use any other portion of the packaging material or Web site to disclose other relevant fees at its discretion, and would be required to disclose the other variations on the long form.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also believed there was particular value in maintaining simplicity on the short form by limiting the top-line portion of the form in order to encourage consumer engagement with the disclosure. Thus, the Bureau proposed to require only four fee types in the top line. For two of those fee types—per purchase fees and ATM withdrawal fees—the Bureau also proposed to require disclosure of two fee values. The Bureau believed that it is important to include two per purchase fees—a per purchase fee when a consumer uses a signature and a per purchase fee when a consumer uses a PIN—because consumers could potentially incur these fees every time they use their prepaid accounts, and the fee could vary depending on how a consumer completes the transaction. The Bureau believed including two per purchase fees would highlight for consumers that the fees for completing a transaction using a PIN versus the fee for using a signature could differ. Similarly, the Bureau believed that it is important to include two ATM withdrawal fees in order to highlight that fees for in-network and out-of-network transactions may differ and to signal to consumers that the product's ATM network may have an impact on the fee incurred, which could lead a consumer to seek out more information about the relevant network. The Bureau noted that in its pre-proposal consumer testing, some participants were confused about the meaning of an ATM network.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>By contrast, the Bureau proposed to allow only one periodic fee and one cash reload fee to be listed in the top line of the short form. The Bureau acknowledged that both of these fees might also vary based, for example, on how often a consumer uses a prepaid account or the method used to reload cash into a prepaid account. Despite this possibility for variation, however, the Bureau believed consumers would benefit more from immediately seeing the two ways the per purchase and ATM withdrawal fees may vary.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Comments received regarding the Bureau's proposed pre-acquisition disclosing regime generally, including those regarding the short form disclosure as a whole, are addressed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b) above. Comments received that address specific disclosure requirements in the short form disclosure are addressed in the section-by-section analysis that corresponds to each specific disclosure requirement. Comments received regarding proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)-1 (regarding how to disclose features that are inapplicable or free) are discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters, including program managers, an issuing credit union, a payment network, and an industry trade association, recommended against requiring disclosure of inapplicable fees. They said such disclosures would take up valuable space on the short form and it would confuse consumers to inform them about fees and services that are not offered, especially for non-reloadable prepaid products and government benefits prepaid cards which, the commenters said, do not charge monthly, per purchase, or cash reload fees. Conversely, two consumer groups, a program manager, and an issuing bank supported the disclosure of inapplicable fees as providing a quick and accurate basis for comparison across prepaid accounts. Another program manager and issuing bank both supported the disclosure of inapplicable fees but recommended requiring “not applicable” instead of “N/A” to clarify to consumers that the service itself, not the fee, is inapplicable. One of the consumer groups said “N/A” was confusing and recommended disclosing “not offered” instead.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One issuing bank and an industry trade association recommended against disclosing when no fee is charged. The bank recommended this specifically for the fees that do not appear in the top line because it said they are not commonly charged and the space in the short form could be used for more commonly-charged fees. The bank recommended listing the required fees if there is a charge but, if there is no charge, permitting the issuer to decide what fee to display. A program manager recommended eliminating the “$0” fee requirement for government benefit accounts for fees that do not apply to such accounts.<footnote ref="386">The Bureau notes that for fees for features that are not available for such accounts, the disclosure made in the short form would be “N/A” not “$0.”</footnote>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As noted above, to simplify the structure of the final rule, the Bureau has modified proposed § 1005.18(b)(2) and (2)(i), to locate the content requirements for the short form disclosure in the final rule under § 1005.18(b)(2). Also, for reasons set forth below, the Bureau is adopting revisions to proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)-1, renumbered as comment 18(b)(2)-1. Second, the Bureau is not finalizing proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)-2 regarding the number of fees to disclose, as this comment would have repeated information found elsewhere in the final regulatory text and commentary. Finally, the Bureau is adopting new comment 18(b)(2)-2 regarding the prohibition on disclosure of finance charges in the short form.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has made both substantive and technical modifications to comment 18(b)(2)-1 to clarify the explanation and examples in the proposed comment that required fees must always be disclosed in the short form—even when the financial institution does not charge a fee or does not offer the feature, in which case the financial institution would disclose “$0” or “N/A,” respectively, as applicable. Although some commenters opposed a requirement to disclose a fee when there is no charge or the feature is not offered, the Bureau is adopting this requirement in the final rule to preserve standardization among short forms such that consumers can see when a feature is offered for free or is not offered at all to better compare prepaid accounts and inform consumer purchase and use decisions. The Bureau recognizes that many payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts do not currently charge certain fees or offer certain features required to be disclosed in the short form, but is finalizing the rule as proposed to allow consumers to compare payroll card accounts or government benefit accounts with their own prepaid accounts or prepaid accounts they may acquire to receive their benefits or wages.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing revealed that nearly all participants understood both “N/A” and “not offered” when disclosed in place of a required fee for features not offered by a financial institution.<footnote ref="387">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report II at 17 and 27.</footnote>
             However, in order to achieve a greater degree of standardization across short form disclosures, the Bureau is finalizing the rule to require disclosure of “N/A,” but not “not offered,” when a financial institution does not offer a feature for which a fee is required to be disclosed in the short form. The Bureau believes this single standardized approach is shorter, simpler, and clearer for consumers to use to compare fees and information in the short form across prepaid accounts. Thus, final comment 18(b)(2)-1 clarifies that “N/A” is the required disclosure when a financial institution does not offer a feature for which a fee is required to be disclosed in the short form.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting new comment 18(b)(2)-2, which clarifies that pursuant to new § 1005.18(b)(3)(vi), a financial institution may not include in the short form disclosure finance charges as described in Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11) imposed in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in § 1026.61. The comment also cross-references new comment 18(b)(3)(vi)-1.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(b)(5) Disclosure Requirements Outside the Short Form Disclosure</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The proposed rule did not include a prepaid account's purchase price or activation fee in the static portion of the short form disclosure. However, proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">8</em>)(I)-2 would have explained, among other things, that the price for purchasing or activating a prepaid account could be disclosed as an incidence-based fee for purposes of proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">8</em>)(I). (To qualify as an incidence-based fee under the proposal, the purchase price or activation fee would have had to be one of up to three fees, other than those disclosed as a static fee in the short form pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) through (<em data-original="E-03">7</em>), that were incurred most frequently in the prior 12-month period by consumers of that particular prepaid account product.)</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>An industry trade association recommended against requiring disclosure of the purchase price in the short form because, it said, consumers already are sufficiently alerted to its display on the packaging of the prepaid account or by the retailer. An issuing bank, on the other hand, recommended disclosure of the purchase price in the short form because, it said, consumers lack clarity on this fee in certain situations, such as when confronted with hundreds of prepaid cards in some retail settings. Several industry commenters, including an issuing bank, a program manager, and a trade association, recommended requiring disclosure of the activation fee instead of the purchase price. Several industry commenters recommended against requiring disclosure of the activation fee in the short form as an incidence-based fee because, they said, it is not a common fee and would be disclosed in the terms and conditions for the prepaid account. They suggested the activation fee be added as a static fee to the short form, perhaps in lieu of one of the incidence-based fees, if the Bureau's research indicated the fee was common enough. Otherwise, they recommended it be disclosed only in the long form.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>A consumer group agreed that the purchase price should not be disclosed in the short form as a static fee because it would take up scarce space when there is no fee (such as for online purchases of prepaid accounts), the purchase price can be conspicuously disclosed on other parts of the packaging, consumers already take notice of the price they have to pay for a prepaid card, and it is a one-time fee such that disclosing it within the short form would overemphasize it and mislead consumers to compare it with recurring fees. It also said that, for prepaid account programs where consumers frequently buy new prepaid cards, the purchase price may appear in any case as an incidence-based fee. Conversely, a consumer group urged requiring disclosure of the purchase price and any activation fee; another consumer group specifically recommended disclosure of the purchase price as a static fee or, alternatively, as a potential incidence-based fee. In support of its recommendation, this latter commenter said its research indicated that nearly half of regular GPR users purchase new cards after exhausting their funds on their current card. Moreover, it said, being charged a purchase fee at the point of purchase does not mean the consumer understands that fee is reducing the amount of funds being loaded onto the card at purchase. It also warned that consumers could confuse the “purchase fee” with the “per purchase fee.” Individual consumers who submitted comments as part of a comment submission campaign organized by a national consumer advocacy group recommended that the short form disclosure include the purchase price.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>With regard to branding, one industry commenter urged the Bureau to clarify that identification within the short form of the name of the prepaid issuer and the name of the prepaid account program would not violate the requirements of the rule.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth below, the Bureau is adopting new § 1005.18(b)(5) and comments 18(b)(5)-1 and -2 to address issues of the disclosure of the purchase price and activation fee as well as identification of the financial institution and the prepaid account program. The final rule requires that, at the time a financial institution provides the short form, it must also disclose the following information: the name of the financial institution; the name of the prepaid account program; the purchase price for the prepaid account, if any; and the fee for activating the prepaid account, if any. Pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(7)(iii), short form disclosures must contain only information required or permitted under final § 1005.18(b)(2). Thus, the information required by § 1005.18(b)(5) must appear outside of the confines of the short form disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New § 1005.18(b)(5) sets forth the required location for the above-referenced disclosures. In a setting other than a retail location, this information must be disclosed in close proximity to the short form. In a retail location, this information, other than the purchase price, must be disclosed on the exterior of the access device's packaging material. In a retail location, the purchase price must be disclosed either on the exterior of or in close proximity to the prepaid account access device's packaging materials. As described in more detail below, new comment 18(b)(5)-1 clarifies the content of the disclosure and comment 18(b)(5)-2 clarifies its location, including the meaning of “close proximity.”</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees that, because the purchase price invariably is disclosed on the packaging or otherwise at the point of purchase prior to acquisition of a prepaid account, it is unnecessary to use the limited space in the short form to disclose this one-time fee as a static fee. The Bureau likewise agrees that it is unnecessary to use the limited space in the short form to disclose the activation fee as a static fee, as it is not a common fee and if charged is only incurred once. The Bureau also believes that including these fees as potential additional fee types in the disclosure under final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) is neither an optimal way to alert consumers to the cost of purchasing or activating a prepaid account nor a good use of the additional fee type disclosure. Because the Bureau believes it is important for consumers to be aware of this fee prior to purchase in all situations, it is requiring that the purchase price and activation fee be disclosed, but outside the short form disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>To ensure that consumers see the purchase price, it must be disclosed in close proximity to the short form—except that in a retail location the financial institution has the option to disclose the purchase price on the exterior of the packaging for the prepaid account access device (other than in the short form) or in close proximity to the display of packaging. The Bureau understands that at present, the purchase price for prepaid accounts sold at retail is disclosed either on the exterior of the prepaid account access device's packaging or displayed near the packaging by the retailer. In an effort not to disturb this system, the Bureau is permitting disclosure of the purchase price in a retail location either on the exterior of or in close proximity to the prepaid account access device's packaging material. The Bureau believes that either location would provide consumers with ample opportunity to be alerted to a prepaid account's purchase price.
          </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>While the activation fee is not a common fee, unless it is plainly disclosed prior to acquisition when it does exist, the Bureau is concerned that it likely would not be noticed by many consumers before they acquire the prepaid account. The Bureau has observed that, similar to purchase price, financial institutions that charge activation fees for prepaid accounts sold at retail often conspicuously disclose the activation fee on the front of the packaging. The Bureau believes that it is important that consumers be informed if a prepaid account they are considering charges an activation fee. The Bureau also believes that, considering that activation fees are uncommon, incurred once, and that in the current marketplace the Bureau has observed such fees disclosed on the front of the packaging in a retail setting, it is appropriate to require the disclosure outside the confines of the short form but in close proximity to it—and, in retail locations, on the exterior of the access device's packaging material. The Bureau believes this requirement will more clearly apprise consumers of when the activation fee is charged and the amount of the fee.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Regarding the general issue of branding, branding information is not permitted to be included within the short form. However, the Bureau recognizes the importance to both industry and consumers of connecting the short form disclosure with the prepaid account's commercial identity. The Bureau understands that it is common industry practice for financial institutions offering prepaid accounts at retail to include this information on the exterior of their packaging. The Bureau believes it is important for this information to be readily available for all prepaid programs, not just those sold at retail. For this reason, the Bureau is requiring, pursuant to new § 1005.18(b)(5), that the name of the financial institution and the name of the prepaid program be disclosed outside the short form but in close proximity to it or, in retail locations, on the exterior of the prepaid account access device's packaging material.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 18(b)(5)-1 clarifies that, in addition to the disclosures required by final § 1005.18(b)(5), a financial institution may, but is not required to, also disclose the name of the program manager or other service provider involved in the prepaid account program.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 18(b)(5)-2 provides additional guidance regarding the location requirement of the rule and the meaning of “close proximity.” The comment explains that, for example, if a financial institution provides the short form online, the information required by final § 1005.18(b)(5) is deemed disclosed in close proximity to the short form disclosure if it appears on the same Web page as the short form disclosure. If the financial institution offers the prepaid account in its own branch locations and provides the short form disclosure on the exterior of its preprinted packaging materials, the information required by final § 1005.18(b)(5) is deemed disclosed in close proximity to the short form disclosure if the information appears on the exterior of the packaging. If the financial institution provides written short form disclosures in a manner other than on preprinted packaging materials, such as on paper, the information required by final § 1005.18(b)(5) is deemed disclosed in close proximity to the short form if it appears on the same piece of paper as the short form disclosure. If the financial institution provides the short form disclosure orally, the information required by final § 1005.18(b)(5) is deemed disclosed in close proximity to the short form disclosure if it is provided immediately before or after disclosing the fees and information required pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Comment 18(b)(5)-2 also explains that, for prepaid accounts sold in a retail location pursuant to the retail location exception in final § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii), final § 1005.18(b)(5) requires the information other than purchase price be disclosed on the exterior of the access device's packaging material. If the purchase price, if any, is not also disclosed on the exterior of the packaging, disclosure of the purchase price on or near the sales rack or display for the packaging materials is deemed disclosed in close proximity to the short form disclosure.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The next part of the Bureau's proposed definition of prepaid account would have addressed how such products must be able to be used to be considered a prepaid account. As the Board noted in adopting the Gift Card Rule, a key difference between a general-use prepaid card and a store gift card is where the card can be used.<footnote ref="304">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 75 FR 16580, 16588 (Apr. 1, 2010).</footnote>
             While store gift cards and gift certificates can be used at only a single merchant or an affiliated group of merchants,<footnote ref="305">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; § 1005.20(a)(1)(ii) and (2)(ii).</footnote>
             a general-use prepaid card is defined in part under the Gift Card Rule as redeemable upon presentation at multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services or usable at ATMs.<footnote ref="306">§ 1005.20(a)(3)(ii).</footnote>
             The Bureau proposed to add § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(B), which would have stated that to qualify as a prepaid account, the card, code or other device had to be redeemable upon presentation at multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, usable at ATMs, or usable for P2P transfers. Proposed comment 2(b)(3)(i)-7 would have referred to existing comments 20(a)(3)-1 and -2 from the Gift Card Rule for guidance regarding the meaning of the phrase multiple, unaffiliated merchants.<footnote ref="307">The Gift Card Rule provides that a card, code, or other device is redeemable upon presentation at multiple, unaffiliated merchants if, for example, such merchants agree to honor the card, code, or device if it bears the mark, logo, or brand of a payment network, pursuant to the rules of the payment network. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; comment 20(a)(3)-1.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believed it was appropriate to limit the definition of prepaid account to those products that consumers could use at multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, at ATMs, or for P2P transfers. The Bureau noted in the proposal that a core feature of a conventional debit card is that it is usable at multiple, unaffiliated merchants and at ATMs. Insofar as a purpose of the Bureau's rulemaking on prepaid accounts is to provide comparable coverage for products with comparable functionality—in this case traditional debit cards and prepaid cards—the Bureau believed it was appropriate to structure the proposed definition in a way that products with similar features had the protections afforded by Regulation E. Pursuant to the proposed definition, therefore, a prepaid account would have been an account that was accepted widely at unaffiliated merchants, rather than only a single merchant or specific group of merchants, such as those located on a college campus or within a mall or defined shopping area.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Next, the Bureau recognized that prepaid products were also growing in popularity as a vehicle for consumers to transmit payments to each other or to businesses. The Bureau noted that an increasing number of products allowed consumers to make P2P or P2B payments without using a third-party branded payment network. These services may not always have wide merchant acceptance, but they do allow consumers to send money to other consumers and businesses. The Bureau proposed to add new comment 2(b)(3)(i)-8 to further explain when accounts capable of P2P transfers were prepaid accounts. Specifically, the comment would have explained that a prepaid account capable of P2P transfers was an account that allowed a consumer to send funds to another consumer or business. As the comment made clear, an account could qualify as a prepaid account if it permitted P2P transfers even if it was neither redeemable upon presentation at multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, nor usable at ATMs. A transaction involving a store gift card would not have been a P2P transfer if it could have only been used to make payments to the merchant or affiliated group of merchants on whose behalf the card was issued.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The only specific aspect of proposed § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(B) on which the Bureau received comment concerned its decision to include products that could only be used to facilitate P2P transfers. A number of consumer groups and a trade association voiced support for the Bureau's decision to include such products in the proposal. Other industry commenters who commented on the issue either opposed coverage of products usable for P2P transfers or requested that the Bureau adopt specific carve-outs from this prong of the definition. A digital wallet provider urged the Bureau to exclude P2P products from the definition of prepaid account, arguing that P2P functionality is more similar to a closed-loop payment system than to open-loop GPR cards. Two industry trade associations and a law firm writing on behalf of a coalition of prepaid issuers argued that regulation of products used solely to facilitate P2P transfers would be premature, and could limit future development of innovative products, to the detriment of consumers. An issuing bank, a program manager, and a commenter representing non-bank money transfer providers noted that products used to facilitate P2P transfers could be interpreted to include products or services offered by State-licensed money transmitters, which they said are already covered under existing regulations. They argued that to avoid duplicative and potentially inconsistent regulation, the Bureau should specifically exclude any product or service that is subject to State or Federal money transmitter laws.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As described above, the Bureau also received a number of more general comments urging greater clarity to distinguish what existing products are subject to general Regulation E from those subject to the Bureau's final rule governing prepaid accounts.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is finalizing § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(B) largely as proposed, but with refinements to limit the scope to accounts whose primary function is among those specifically listed. To accomplish this change, the Bureau has removed the phrase “is redeemable upon presentation at” and replaced it with “whose primary function is,” to clarify that, in order to qualify as a prepaid account under this portion of the definition, an account must be more than merely capable of being used in the ways specified. Finally, as part of its overall reordering of § 1005.2(b)(3), the Bureau has renumbered proposed § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(B) as final § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>). Specifically, final § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) defines a prepaid account, in part, as an account whose primary function is to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, or at ATMs, or to conduct P2P transfers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has considered the comments regarding the appropriateness of extending the definition of prepaid account to products that can only be used for P2P transfers, and has decided to finalize its decision to include such products in the definition of prepaid account. The Bureau continues to believe that the structure and usage of P2P products warrants their inclusion in the final rule. Unlike many limited-use prepaid products that have acceptance limited to a restricted location (such as at merchants located on a college campus or in a mall), P2P products do not have such a limitation. Indeed, as the Bureau noted in the proposal, insofar as a P2P product could be accepted by anyone that contracts with the P2P provider, the model is not very different from a card association that contracts with unaffiliated merchants. Further, insofar as consumers could use these products to pay anyone with funds stored in the account, the Bureau continues to believe that they should be included in the definition of prepaid account. Accordingly, the Bureau declines to exclude such products from coverage under the final rule. The Bureau is therefore finalizing the reference to P2P transfers in § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), and finalizing proposed comment 2(b)(3)(i)-8, renumbered as comment 2(b)(3)(i)-10, largely as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has also revised proposed § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(B), renumbered as § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), to more clearly delineate the distinction between accounts that are covered by existing Regulation E and accounts that are covered under the new definition of prepaid account. Specifically, the Bureau has refocused the definition to apply only to accounts “whose primary function is to conduct” transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants or at ATMs, or P2P transfers. (In addition, as discussed below, the Bureau is adding a new prong, § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D)(3), to explicitly exclude checking accounts, share draft accounts, and NOW accounts from the residual definition of prepaid accounts.) The Bureau is aware that many types of accounts, including accounts already covered by Regulation E, may be capable of being used for the above functions. The Bureau is therefore concerned that the language used in proposed § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(B) could be over-inclusive, contributing to the uncertainty raised by some commenters regarding which accounts are covered under which provisions of Regulation E.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau intends its change here to narrow the definition of prepaid account to focus on products whose primary function for consumers is to provide general capability to use loaded funds to conduct transactions with merchants, or at ATMs, or to conduct P2P transfers, while excluding products that only provide such capability incidental to a different primary function. For example, the primary function of a traditional brokerage account is to hold funds so that the consumer can conduct transactions through a licensed broker or firm, not to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, or at ATMs, or to conduct P2P transfers. Similarly, the primary function of a savings account is to accrue interest on funds held in the account; such accounts restrict the extent to which the consumer can conduct general transactions and withdrawals.<footnote ref="308">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; the Board's Regulation D, 12 CFR 204.2(d) (defining a savings deposit as a deposit or account with respect to which the depositor may be required by the depository institution to give written notice of an intended withdrawal or a deposit or account from which the depositor is permitted or authorized to make no more than six transfers and withdrawals, or a combination of such transfers and withdrawals, per calendar month or statement cycle).</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>To provide greater clarity about this intended interpretation, the Bureau is making minor wording revisions to § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) and related commentary to accommodate the “primary function” approach, and is adding a comment with several illustrative examples of when an account satisfies the “primary function” prong of final § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D). New comment 2(b)(3)(i)-8 clarifies that, to qualify as a prepaid account, an account's primary function must be to provide consumers with general transaction capabilities, including by enabling consumers to use loaded funds to conduct the transactions enumerated in § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), and that accounts that provide such capabilities only incidentally are excluded from the definition, and as such are not prepaid accounts as defined by final § 1005.2(b)(3). The comment provides examples of accounts that provide the enumerated transactional capabilities only incidentally—specifically, brokerage accounts and savings accounts, where a consumer deposits money, for example, with a financial institution for the primary purpose of conducting transactions with the institution (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> to conduct trades in a brokerage account) rather than with third parties. The comment then provides several examples for additional guidance. New comment 2(b)(3)(i)-8.i clarifies that an account's primary function is to enable a consumer to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, or at ATMs, or to conduct P2P transfers, even if it also enables a third party to disburse funds to a consumer. For example, a prepaid account that conveys tax refunds or insurance proceeds to a consumer meets the primary function test if the account can be used, <em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> to purchase goods or services at multiple, unaffiliated merchants.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Next, new comment 2(b)(3)(i)-8.ii clarifies that whether an account satisfies final § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D) is determined by reference to the account, not the access device associated with the account. An account satisfies final § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D) even if the account's access device can be used for other purposes, <em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> as a form of identification. Such accounts may include, for example, a prepaid account used to disburse student loan proceeds via a card device that can be used at unaffiliated merchants or to withdraw cash from an ATM, even if that access device also acts as a student identification card.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 2(b)(3)(i)-8.iii clarifies that, where multiple accounts are associated with the same access device, the primary function of each account is determined separately. The comment goes on to clarify that one or more accounts can satisfy final § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D) even if other accounts associated with the same access device do not. This commentary is intended to address situations where two or more separate “wallets” or “purses” are associated with the same access device. It provides the specific example of a student identification card, which may act as an access device associated with two separate accounts: An account used to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, and an account used to conduct closed-loop transactions on campus. The comment clarifies that the account used to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services satisfies final § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D), even though the account used to conduct closed-loop transactions does not.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Next, new comment 2(b)(3)(i)-8.iv clarifies that an account satisfies final § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D) if its primary function is to provide general transaction capability, even if an individual consumer does not in fact use it to conduct multiple transactions. For example, the fact that a consumer may choose to withdraw the entire account balance at an ATM or transfer it to another account held by the consumer does not change the fact that the account's primary function is to provide general transaction capability. The Bureau is including this comment to clarify that an account's primary function is not determined by how frequently an individual consumer chooses to use the account for a given function. This clarification aligns with the Bureau's decision, discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.2(b)(3) above, to cover under the final rule as prepaid accounts those products that do not necessarily act as transaction account substitutes. For example, the Bureau understands that some consumers who receive funds from third parties—such as tax refunds or insurance proceeds—via prepaid accounts may not always transact with the accounts on an ongoing basis, opting instead to withdraw the funds from the account in their entirety after acquisition or transfer them to another account. Pursuant to new comment 2(b)(3)(i)-8.iv, these consumer's accounts would still meet the “primary function” prong set forth in final § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, new comment 2(b)(3)(i)-8.v states the corollary of the general rule set forth in § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>). Specifically, it explains that an account whose primary function is other than to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, or at ATMs, or to conduct P2P transfers, does not satisfy final § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D). The comment goes on to provide the example of an account whose only function is to make a one-time transfer of funds into a separate prepaid account as an account that would not qualify as a prepaid account under this prong of the definition. Such accounts could include, for example, so-called reload packs, which several industry commenters urged the Bureau to exclude from coverage under the final rule. In contrast to non-reloadable prepaid cards, which can be used to make purchases or other transactions, reload packs can only be used to transfer funds into prepaid accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adopting proposed comment 2(b)(3)(i)-7, renumbered as comment 2(b)(3)(i)-9, which cross-references comments 20(a)(3)-1 and -2 for guidance on the meaning of the term redeemable upon presentation at multiple, unaffiliated merchants.</analysisParagraph>

             When the Bureau issued its remittance transfer regulation (subpart B of Regulation E), it altered Regulation E's general requirement for foreign language disclosures to require disclosures be made in English in addition to a foreign language, if that foreign language is used principally by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfer services at the office in which the sender conducts a transaction or asserts an error.<footnote ref="465">ICF Report II at 11.</footnote>
             The Bureau amended Regulation E in this way pursuant to a statutory mandate in section 1073 of the Dodd-Frank Act.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to modify the general Regulation E foreign language requirement for prepaid accounts such that proposed § 1005.18(b)(6) would have required that if a financial institution principally uses a foreign language on prepaid account packaging material, by telephone, in person, or on the Web site a consumer utilizes to acquire a prepaid account, the short form and long form disclosures made pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) and (ii) would have to be provided in that same foreign language. Proposed § 1005.18(b)(6) would have also required a financial institution to provide the long form disclosure required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii) in English upon a consumer's request and on any part of the Web site where it provides the long form disclosure in a foreign language. Proposed comment 18(b)(6)-1 would have provided several examples as to when financial institutions would have to provide the short form and long form disclosures in a foreign language.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received several comments from industry, consumer groups, and one State government agency addressing this aspect of the proposal. Specifically, the consumer groups and the State government agency generally supported requiring financial institutions to provide pre-acquisition disclosures in the foreign language the financial institution uses in connection with the acquisition of a prepaid account. Some of these commenters argued that, if financial institutions market prepaid accounts in a foreign language, or otherwise reach out to non- and limited-English speaking consumers, they should also be required to provide the disclosures in that language. One commenter urged the Bureau to require financial institutions to provide disclosures in commonly spoken languages. Another commenter explained that providing disclosures in a consumer's preferred language gives non- and limited-English speaking families accurate information regarding their prepaid accounts and creates an inclusive culture that consumers seek when making financial decisions. Another commenter requested that the Bureau extend this requirement to all required disclosures, not just the pre-acquisition disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Some of the consumer groups urged the Bureau to further expand the proposed foreign language requirements to require foreign language support for live customer service calls in any language the financial institution uses in connection with the marketing or acquisition of a prepaid account. Some commenters stated that customer service representatives (and interpreters) should be both fluent in the spoken language and knowledgeable about prepaid accounts to ensure that communication with non- and limited-English speaking consumers is as effective as communication with other consumers. One commenter explained that deploying a customer service representative (or an interpreter) that does not have the necessary expertise can result in the dissemination of inaccurate information. Other commenters stated that customer service calls in foreign languages also enable non- and limited-English speaking consumers to obtain account balances, request transaction information, access general account information, and exercise dispute rights. See the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(c)(1) for a discussion of the comments received on foreign language support for customer service calls as it relates to accessing account information.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Two industry trade associations and a coalition of prepaid account issuers agreed that, where a financial institution engages in a deliberate marketing program to solicit consumers in a foreign language, it may be reasonable to require disclosures in that same language. One of the commenters explained that, in those situations, financial institutions control the languages used in the marketing programs and can determine whether it makes business sense to develop and implement disclosures in a particular language.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received several comments from industry, including from industry trade associations, and a law firm writing on behalf of a coalition of prepaid issuers, arguing, however, that the foreign language disclosure requirement, as proposed, would discourage financial institutions from servicing non- and limited-English speaking consumers in their preferred languages, especially at branch locations and call centers. Several commenters argued that the “by telephone” and “in person” components of the proposed requirement could actually be detrimental to consumers because employees of a financial institution would be prohibited from engaging with them in their preferred languages if the financial institution did not have pre-acquisition disclosures available in those languages. These commenters stated that the proposed requirement would also undermine financial institutions' efforts to service communities with a high number of non- and limited-English speaking consumers (by hiring staff with specific language abilities and establishing branches and offices in those areas), which they stated is generally supported by other bank regulators. Several commenters urged the Bureau to apply instead the current foreign language disclosure requirements under Regulation E to prepaid accounts.<footnote ref="466">As discussed above, Regulation E generally permits, but does not require, that disclosures be made in a language other than English, provided that where foreign language disclosures are provided the disclosures are made available in English upon a consumer's request. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; § 1005.4(a)(2).</footnote>
             However, these commenters requested that, if the Bureau proceeds with the proposed requirement, the term “principally uses a foreign language” not cover certain situations, such as responses to consumer-initiated inquiries; interactions with consumers through the use of an interpreter; and interactions where the financial institution knows, based on a prior relationship or interaction, that the consumer prefers a language other than English.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>These industry commenters argued that the requirement as proposed would also impose significant compliance burdens on financial institutions. These commenters explained that financial institutions would need to train their employees to speak only in English, or in the specific languages for which pre-acquisition disclosures are available, if the topic of prepaid accounts comes up while assisting consumers. These commenters stated that customer service interactions that are in person or over the telephone could implicate hundreds of languages, thereby making compliance with the proposed requirements virtually impossible. These commenters further stated that financial institutions cannot always control the languages spoken at a retail setting, by a program manager, or even at branch locations. In addition, these commenters stated that financial institutions cannot ensure that third-party providers, such as employers and government agencies, will comply with the requirement because financial institutions might not know whether a language other than English is spoken at the time of acquisition.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter urged the Bureau not to require financial institutions to provide the long form disclosure in English upon request in addition to providing the disclosures in a foreign language, as it did not believe it would be necessary or customary to do so.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is finalizing proposed § 1005.18(b)(6), renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(9), pursuant to its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c), 905(a), and section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, with several modifications explained below. The Bureau believes that certain foreign language disclosures are necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account users, because the proposed revision will assist consumers' understanding of the terms and conditions of their prepaid accounts. In addition, consistent with section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, the foreign language disclosures will ensure that the features of the prepaid accounts are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.18(b)(9)(i) sets forth the general foreign language disclosure requirements for prepaid accounts. Specifically, it requires a financial institution to provide the pre-acquisition disclosures required by § 1005.18(b) in a foreign language, if the financial institution uses that same foreign language in connection with the acquisition of a prepaid account in the following circumstances: (1) The financial institution principally uses a foreign language on prepaid account packaging material; (2) the financial institution principally uses a foreign language to advertise, solicit, or market a prepaid account and provides a means in the advertisement, solicitation, or marketing material that the consumer uses to acquire the prepaid account by telephone or electronically; or (3) the financial institution provides a means for the consumer to acquire a prepaid account by telephone or electronically principally in a foreign language.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is finalizing in § 1005.18(b)(9)(i) the general requirement from the proposal that a financial institution must provide the pre-acquisition disclosures in a foreign language, if the financial institution principally uses that foreign language on prepaid account packaging material, by telephone, or on the Web site a consumer uses to acquire a prepaid account. The Bureau is clarifying in final § 1005.18(b)(9)(i) that the requirement to provide the pre-acquisition disclosures in a foreign language applies only in connection with the acquisition of a prepaid account. In addition, the Bureau has replaced the phrase “on the Web site” with “electronically” in final § 1005.18(b)(9)(i) to more clearly cover all situations in which a consumer can electronically acquire a prepaid account, such as by clicking on a link provided by the financial institution on an advertisement accessed on a mobile device, for example. The Bureau continues to believe that if a financial institution provides a way for a consumer to acquire a prepaid account in a foreign language, the financial institution is making a deliberate effort to obtain the consumer's business and therefore should be required to provide the pre-acquisition disclosures in that foreign language. The Bureau also believes that if a financial institution principally uses a foreign language on the interface that a consumer sees or uses to initiate the process of acquiring a prepaid account, the consumer should receive pre-acquisition disclosures in that foreign language to ensure they are able to understand the required disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>However, the Bureau has removed from final § 1005.18(b)(9)(i) the proposed requirement to provide the pre-acquisition disclosures in a foreign language if the financial institution principally uses that foreign language in person, as requested by several commenters. The Bureau agrees with commenters that servicing non- and limited-English speaking consumers in their preferred language is critical and would not want to discourage employees of financial institutions at branch locations from using their foreign language abilities to assist these consumers. Similarly, the Bureau understands the importance of servicing communities with a high number of non- and limited-English speaking consumers and does not seek to stifle efforts made by financial institutions to reach out to these communities.<footnote ref="467">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; CFPB's Financial Education Programs Serving Immigrant Populations (July 2016), &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;available at&lt;/em&gt;
              &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/financial-education-programs-serving-immigrant-populations/&lt;/em&gt;.</footnote>
             In addition, the Bureau understands that financial institutions cannot always know or control the languages that are spoken at branch locations or in other in-person environments (particularly when those locations are operated by third parties), and that providing disclosures in every possible language their employees speak might not be feasible. The Bureau believes that by not including the in-person trigger in final § 1005.18(b)(9)(i), financial institutions will be able to better comply with this requirement while not discouraging them from servicing non- and limited-English speaking consumers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has added a trigger for when a financial institution principally uses a foreign language to advertise, solicit, or market a prepaid account and provides a means in the advertisement, solicitation, or marketing material for the consumer to acquire a prepaid account by telephone or electronically, in response to the comments it received. The Bureau agrees with commenters that if a financial institution deliberately targets consumers by advertising, soliciting, or marketing to them in a foreign language, the financial institution should be required to provide the pre-acquisition disclosures in that same language. The Bureau believes it is particularly important to require financial institutions to provide the disclosures in a foreign language, if in addition to deliberately targeting consumers, financial institutions use those same communications to drive consumers to a specific telephone number or Web site to acquire a prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.18(b)(9)(ii) provides that a financial institution required to provide pre-acquisition disclosures in a foreign language pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(9)(i) must also provide the information required to be disclosed in its pre-acquisition long form disclosure pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(4) in English upon a consumer's request and on any part of the Web site where it discloses this information in a foreign language. The Bureau believes that the ability to obtain the long form disclosure information in English will be beneficial to consumers in various situations, such as when a family member is assisting a non-English speaking consumer to manage his prepaid account but only reads English. Further, this requirement is consistent with existing § 1005.4(a)(2), which requires that disclosures made under Regulation E in a language other than English be made available in English upon the customer's request. The Bureau has observed that many financial institutions that offer prepaid accounts in a foreign language already provide the pre-acquisition disclosures and the initial disclosures in both English and the foreign language without a request from the consumer, which the Bureau believes is beneficial for consumers. The Bureau has also revised the internal paragraph references within final § 1005.18(b)(9) and related commentary to conform to numbering changes in this final rule and has made other technical revisions for organizational purposes.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is finalizing proposed comment 18(b)(6)-1, renumbered as comment 18(b)(9)-1, with examples that reflect the changes to § 1005.18(b)(9)(i) and that illustrate situations in which a financial institution must provide the pre-acquisition disclosures in a foreign language and situations in which it is not required to provide the disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting new comment 18(b)(9)-2 to clarify when a foreign language is principally used. This comment explains that all relevant facts and circumstances determine whether a foreign language is principally used by the financial institution to advertise, solicit, or market under final § 1005.18(b)(9). Whether a foreign language is principally used is determined at the packaging material, advertisement, solicitation, or marketing communication level, not at the prepaid account program level or across the financial institution's activities as a whole. A financial institution that advertises a prepaid account program in multiple languages would evaluate its use of foreign language in each advertisement to determine whether it has principally used a foreign language therein.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting new comment 18(b)(9)-3 to explain the term “advertise, solicit, or market.” This comment clarifies that any commercial message, appearing in any medium, that promotes directly or indirectly the availability of prepaid accounts constitutes advertising, soliciting, or marketing for purposes of § 1005.18(b)(9). This comment also provides examples illustrating advertising, soliciting, and marketing. The Bureau notes that advertising, soliciting, and marketing could include, for example, outreach via social media. New comment 18(b)(9)-3 resembles comment 31(g)(1)-2, which corresponds to the foreign language disclosure requirements for remittance transfers in § 1005.31(g)(1). However, new comment 18(b)(9)-3 has been altered to accommodate for the differences between how consumers acquire prepaid accounts and how they initiate remittance transfers. For example, the Bureau did not include in new comment 18(b)(9)-3 specific examples from comment 31(g)(1)-2 related to advertisements, solicitations, and marketing communications at an office because scenarios at an office do not usually apply in the prepaid account context.<footnote ref="468">These examples include announcements in a foreign language on a public address system at an office; printed material in a foreign language on any exterior or interior sign at an office; and point-of-sale displays in a foreign language at an office. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; comment 31(g)(1)-2.</footnote>
             In addition, the Bureau believes that leaving these examples out of new comment 18(b)(9)-3 avoids confusion related to the proposed in person trigger that was removed from this final rule. Thus, final § 1005.18(b)(9) would not apply to general advertisements, solicitations, and marketing communications that are in a foreign language and displayed at a retail or branch location that do not meet any of the triggers in § 1005.18(b)(9)(i)(A) through (C).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting new comment 18(b)(9)-4 to explain the requirements in final § 1005.18(b)(9)(ii), which states that a financial institution required to provide pre-acquisition disclosures in a foreign language pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(9)(i) must also provide the information required to be disclosed in its pre-acquisition long form disclosure pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(4) in English upon a consumer's request and on any part of the Web site where it discloses this information in a foreign language. New comment 18(b)(9)-4 clarifies that a financial institution required to provide pre-acquisition disclosures in a foreign language pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(9)(i) may, but is not required to, provide the English version of the pre-acquisition long form disclosure information required by final § 1005.18(b)(4) in accordance with the formatting, grouping, size and other requirements set forth in final § 1005.18(b) for the long form disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau declines to implement at this time other suggestions made by several commenters, which include requiring foreign language support for customer service calls; requiring customer service representatives and interpreters to be both fluent in a foreign language and knowledgeable about prepaid accounts; and requiring all disclosures, not just pre-acquisition disclosures, to be provided in a foreign language. The Bureau believes these measures are beyond the scope of this rulemaking and therefore declines to adopt them now. The Bureau is also concerned that imposing additional requirements in this final rule would discourage financial institutions from servicing non- or limited-English speaking consumers and from offering prepaid accounts in foreign languages. The Bureau understands that the costs associated with such requirements involve hiring and retaining trained personnel fluent in other languages, which may be cost prohibitive for many financial institutions. In addition, the Bureau has focused on the pre-acquisition disclosures because it believes that they present a reasonable and appropriate step forward focusing on the most important information at the stage that the consumer is acquiring the prepaid account. But for the reasons discussed above, the Bureau declines to insert additional requirements in this final rule.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(b)(8) Terminology of Pre-Acquisition Disclosures</title>
      <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth below, the Bureau is adopting the final rule with the addition of § 1005.18(b)(8), which requires that fee names and other terms must be used consistently within and across the disclosures required by final § 1005.18(b). New comment 18(b)(8)-1 provides an example illustrating this requirement. The comment also clarifies that a financial institution may substitute the term prepaid “account” for the term prepaid “card” as appropriate, wherever it is used in final § 1005.18(b).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>A consumer group commenter recommended that the Bureau require uniform terms across disclosures to prevent use of a variety of terminology for certain required fees and information. The Bureau agrees that use of consistent terminology within and across the short form and long form disclosures for a particular prepaid account program will enhance consumer comprehension, and thus is adopting new § 1005.18(b)(8). The Bureau declines to eliminate the “substantially similar” requirement for various terms throughout final § 1005.18(b)(2) and replace it with a less flexible standard. Thus, the final rule generally does not require the uniform use of a specific term for particular fees across all short form disclosures. The Bureau believes it can achieve a degree of standardization across short form disclosures that will enhance consumer engagement and comprehension by requiring that the terms used be substantially similar to the terms set forth in the rule and model forms without mandating universal use of a specific term. Moreover, the Bureau believes the safe harbor afforded to financial institutions using the short form disclosure model forms will encourage financial institutions to use the specific terminology in the model forms where appropriate.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>However, as set forth in the comment 18(b)(8)-1, a financial institution may use the terms prepaid “account” and prepaid “card” interchangeably in the short and long forms, as appropriate. The Bureau is allowing use of these terms because they may be used synonymously in the prepaid context, particularly in light of the terminology used in this final rule, but the Bureau recognizes that in some cases one of the terms may be more apt than the other.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(b)(2)(x) Statement Regarding Overdraft Credit Features</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to include in the short form disclosure a statement indicating whether a consumer might be offered certain types of credit features in connection with a prepaid account. Specifically, proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">9</em>) would have required a statement on the short form disclosure directly below the top-line fees that credit-related fees may apply, in a form substantially similar to the clause set forth in proposed Model Form A-10(c), if, at any point, a credit plan that would be a credit card account under Regulation Z (12 CFR part 1026) may be offered in connection with the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">9</em>) would have explained that a credit plan that would be a credit card account under Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) could be structured either as a credit plan that could be accessed through the same device that accesses the prepaid account, or through an account number where extensions of credit are permitted to be deposited directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor offering the plan. Proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">9</em>) further provided that if neither of these two types of credit plans would be offered in connection with the prepaid account at any point, a financial institution would have to disclose on the short form a statement that no overdraft or credit-related fees will be charged, in a form substantially similar to the clause set forth in proposed Model Form A-10(d). The proposed model forms showed this disclosure as “This card may charge credit-related fees” or “No overdraft or credit-related fees.”</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the proposal, in the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing, many participants expressed a desire to avoid using any financial products that offer overdraft. Further, other research indicates that many consumers turn to prepaid cards specifically to avoid incurring any overdraft charges.<footnote ref="424">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 2014 Pew Study at 1.</footnote>
             The Bureau therefore believed that if a financial institution may offer a credit feature, then a consumer should be on notice of this possibility before acquiring the prepaid account. The Bureau believed that placing such notice on the short form disclosure would allow consumers to decide whether they want to acquire a prepaid account that may offer credit, or whether they would prefer an account that would not offer credit. Without such a notice, the Bureau believed that consumers may not have adequate information to decide which prepaid account is best for them. The Bureau recognized that there might be some risk of confusion from providing a relatively terse statement about credit because the Bureau also proposed in § 1005.18(g) and in Regulation Z § 1026.12(h) to require financial institutions to wait at least 30 days before offering prepaid account holders credit, and not all account holders may qualify for such credit features in any event. The Bureau noted, however, that additional information would be provided on the long form about credit availability and believed that the importance of alerting all consumers as to whether credit features could be offered in connection with a prepaid account warranted including a brief statement on the short from.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">9</em>)-1 would have explained that the statement required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">9</em>) would have to be provided on all short form disclosures, regardless of whether some consumers would be solicited to enroll in such a plan, if such a credit plan could be offered.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>While the Bureau received many comments regarding its proposed approach to regulating overdraft and certain other credit features on prepaid accounts generally, few commenters addressed the Bureau's proposal regarding how to disclose these features in the short form and long form disclosures.<footnote ref="425">For an overview of the Bureau's overall approach to regulating overdraft credit features for prepaid accounts, see the &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z&lt;/em&gt; section below. For a discussion of disclosure of overdraft and credit features in the long form disclosure, see the section-by-section analyses of § 1005.18(b)(4)(iv) and (vii) below.</footnote>
             With regard to the short form disclosure, two issuing banks and an industry trade association recommended eliminating the disclosure for products that could offer associated credit features, saying it would be confusing to consumers given that the proposed rules would require financial institutions to wait 30 days after registration of a prepaid account to offer credit features and to obtain separate consumer consent. Another industry trade association and a program manager recommended substituting the word “feature” for “fee” in the proposed disclosure of “No overdraft or credit-related fees,” suggesting this change would avoid the potentially erroneous impression that a credit feature might be offered for free.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Two consumer groups recommended including the disclosure in the short form only when overdraft or credit are offered and not when such features are not offered. They said that disclosure when such features are not offered would confuse consumers, as most prepaid account programs do not offer overdraft or credit. They also said the absence of the negative disclosure would offer a starker contrast to the affirmative disclosure required when such features are offered. These consumer groups also recommended more fulsome disclosure in the short form regarding offered overdraft and credit features, such as requiring disclosure of fees for transfers, loads, negative balances, and insufficient funds. These groups also recommended that this disclosure should be made more prominent, such as by requiring a larger-size font. One consumer group recommended that the disclosure distinguish between prepaid account programs that offer overdraft and those that offer credit features so that financial institutions that offer prepaid accounts with low cost lines of credit (with consumer consent) can be distinguished from those that offer overdraft. Finally, two consumer groups recommended that the Bureau require the word “overdraft” in the disclosure because, they said, consumers know this term and it is crucial information for them. These consumer groups also opposed using the term “credit-related fees,” as they believed it would be opaque and incomprehensible to consumers.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">9</em>) and comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">9</em>)-1, renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(2)(x) and comment 18(b)(2)(x)-1, as proposed with certain modifications as described below. As discussed below in connection with Regulation Z, the final rule makes some revisions as to the proposal's scope of coverage regarding covered overdraft and other credit features and final § 1005.18(b)(2)(x) mirrors these revisions. The final rule also revises the proposed content of the disclosure for clarity and completeness. The Bureau also made technical modifications to the rule and final comment 18(b)(2)(x)-1 for conformity and clarity.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Specifically, if a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in Regulation Z § 1026.61 may be offered at any point to a consumer in connection with the prepaid account, the final rule requires the financial institution to disclose a statement that overdraft/credit may be offered, the time period after which it may be offered, and that fees would apply, using the following clause or a substantially similar clause: “You may be offered overdraft/credit after [x] days. Fees would apply.” If no such credit feature will be offered at any point to a consumer in connection with the prepaid account, the financial institution must disclose a statement that no overdraft/credit feature is offered, using the following clause or a substantially similar clause: “No overdraft/credit feature.” Comment 18(b)(2)(x)-1, adopted largely as proposed, clarifies that this statement must be provided on the short form disclosures for all prepaid accounts that may offer such a feature, regardless of whether some consumers may never be solicited or qualify to enroll in such a feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the proposal, the Bureau is adopting the requirement to disclose in the short form whether an overdraft credit feature as defined by the final rule may be offered in connection with a prepaid account because it believes this is key information consumers should know to better inform their prepaid account purchase and use decisions, particularly for those consumers seeking to use prepaid accounts to avoid overdraft or credit-related charges and those seeking out prepaid accounts with such features.<footnote ref="426">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report II at 25. (In the Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing, participants were nearly evenly split as to whether knowing a prepaid card offering overdraft or credit made them feel more positively or negatively toward the card.)</footnote>
             In keeping with the overall goal of the short form disclosure to provide consumers with a snapshot of key information, the disclosure required in the final rule is designed to alert consumers to whether an overdraft credit feature may be offered to them and, if so, two other key pieces of information—that there is a waiting period, and that fees will apply.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe it is possible to give consumers the detailed information needed to make a decision about an overdraft credit feature on the short form, and that attempting to do so would substantially undermine the value of the form—that is, succinctly providing consumers with the most important information needed to make a decision about whether to acquire the prepaid account. Moreover, the Bureau is concerned that devoting scarce space to overdraft credit features would distract consumers from this decision-making process, resulting in less space to address the core functionalities of the prepaid account. In addition, given that some consumers may not satisfy creditors' underwriting requirements or other eligibility criteria, the Bureau believes that a limited disclosure strikes the best practicable balance between competing considerations.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, the Bureau has made a strategic decision to limit information on the short form disclosure about overdraft credit features to this one statement, and to refer consumers to the long form for more detailed information about all fees and conditions, including information about any overdraft credit feature. The Bureau recognizes that the short form disclosure will not provide consumers with a detailed definition of the term “overdraft/credit” or the details about a particular overdraft credit feature, but believes that the disclosure strikes a reasonable balance given the goals of the form, its performance in testing, and its space constraints. In short, the Bureau believes that the form will give consumers the most critical information about any overdraft credit features with a strong incentive to seek additional details in the long form disclosure or elsewhere if they are interested. Relatedly, consistent with this overall decision, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to exclude any finance charges related to an overdraft credit feature from the additional fee type disclosures required in the short form pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii) and (ix), as discussed above.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Participants in the Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing generally understood that an affirmative statement about the availability of overdraft or credit in a prototype short form disclosure indicated the feature was offered while a negative statement indicated it was not offered. All participants given a short form indicating a prepaid card did not offer overdraft or credit correctly understood that no such program would be offered or that a transaction would not go through if the consumer tried to make a purchase for more money than the amount loaded on the card. Conversely, all participants given a short form indicating a prepaid card offered overdraft or credit who noticed the statement correctly understood that a transaction might be allowed in some cases if they tried to make a purchase for more money than the amount loaded on the card.<footnote ref="427">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report II at 14.</footnote>
             Thus, post-proposal testing results confirm consumer understanding of disclosures both when an overdraft credit feature is offered and when no such feature is offered—as would have been required by the proposed rule.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Moreover, the long form disclosure will provide additional information about overdraft credit features for consumers who are interested in such programs including, as referenced by a consumer group commenter, programs under which prepaid accounts with low lines of credit are offered. As discussed in detail below, final § 1005.18(b)(4)(iv) requires that the long form disclosure contain a statement that mirrors the overdraft credit statement required in the short form by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(x). In addition, for prepaid account programs offering an overdraft credit feature as defined by the final rule, the long form disclosure must include the actual fees consumers may incur for using that feature that are imposed in connection with the prepaid account (pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii)),<footnote ref="428">See comment 18(b)(7)(i)(B)-1 for guidance regarding disclosure of finance charges in the long form.</footnote>
             as well as the disclosures described in Regulation Z § 1026.60(e)(1) (pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(4)(vii)).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also believes that the final rule's refinements to the language and placement of the short form statement about overdraft credit features will reduce the risk of consumer confusion about the nature and timing of any credit offers. To emphasize its importance, pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(7)(ii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>), the statement about overdraft credit features must be in bold-faced type. The proposed rule would have required the statement to be located within the fee section of the short form disclosure, just below the top-line fees, to emphasize its relative importance among all the disclosures on the short form. In the final rule, the Bureau has relocated the statement to the section below the fee disclosures together with other statements required in the short form disclosure, as upon further consideration, the Bureau is concerned locating it amidst the fee disclosures could be confusing to consumers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau's consumer testing and other considerations, such as commenters' concerns that consumers may be confused by the proposed short form's lack of information regarding availability of the feature and the Bureau's proposed 30-day waiting period, after which consumers may be solicited for or may link credit to a prepaid account, led the Bureau to require disclosure that a consumer “ <em data-original="E-03">may</em> be offered overdraft/credit <em data-original="E-03">after [x] days”</em> (emphasis added). In response to the concern that the proposed disclosure could intimate that prepaid account programs offer overdraft or credit programs for free, the final rule requires explicit disclosure that “[f]ees would apply.” Where no overdraft credit feature will be offered, the final rule requires disclosure of “[n]o overdraft/credit <em data-original="E-03">feature”</em> (emphasis added), replacing the proposed term “fee.” The Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing revealed, consistent with the Bureau's proposed rule, that the statements required in the final rule effectively provide the information that the Bureau intends to be imparted in that most participants understood that overdraft or credit may or may not be offered (as applicable), that obtaining the service is not guaranteed, that there is a 30-day waiting period, and that they may pay fees for the service.<footnote ref="429">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report II at 14 and 24-25.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The disclosures required under the final rule use the term “overdraft/credit” instead of the proposed “credit-related [fees]” and “overdraft or credit-related [fees]” because the Bureau agrees with commenters that use of the term “overdraft” in both versions of the disclosure may be more meaningful to consumers. The Bureau is concerned that, while the term “overdraft credit” (without a slash) is more technically accurate, it may not have particular meaning to consumers. The Bureau also believes that use of the same term in both the short form and long form disclosures will facilitate consumers' ability to comparison shop.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For all of these reasons, the Bureau believes that the refined and relatively short statement regarding whether overdraft credit features may be offered in connection with the prepaid account strikes the best balance for the short form disclosure. The Bureau therefore declines to add additional details about the terms of such overdraft credit features to the short form disclosure.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>All testing participants understood both versions of the statement language as saying that they did not have to accept their wages/government benefits via that prepaid card. Also, while participants understood from both versions that there were other ways to receive their payments, those that received version two were able to identify the specific options available to them. Finally, most participants expressed essentially neutral feelings about both versions of the statement and appeared to be drawing on past experiences, rather than the language in the statement, to decide whether or not they would want to use the payroll card account or the government benefit account.<footnote ref="442">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Even though the Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing confirmed that the proposed version of the statement regarding wage or benefit payment options would not be perceived as negative by consumers and that participants understood the statement, the Bureau has decided to include in the final rule an alternative version of the statement language which the Bureau believes would address commenters' concerns and have the added advantage of providing concrete options to consumer of how they can receive their funds.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is thus finalizing § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(A), which provides that for payroll card accounts, a financial institution must disclose a statement that the consumer does not have to accept the payroll card account and directing the consumer to ask about other ways to receive wages or salary from the employer instead of receiving them via the payroll card account using the following clause or a substantially similar clause: “You do not have to accept this payroll card. Ask your employer about other ways to receive your wages.” Alternatively, a financial institution may provide a statement that the consumer has several options to receive wages or salary, followed by a list of the options available to the consumer, and directing the consumer to tell the employer which option the consumer chooses using the following clause or a substantially similar clause: “You have several options to receive your wages: [list of options available to the consumer]; or this payroll card. Tell your employer which option you choose.” This statement must be located above the information required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (iv), which are located in the top line of the short form.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The statements regarding wage payment options in the final rule do not incorporate much of the additional information recommended by some consumer group commenters, such as explaining the benefit of direct deposit and providing information on how to un-enroll from the payroll card account. The Bureau declines to add such information because the design of the short form disclosure seeks a balance between the disclosure of key information necessary for consumer acquisition and use decisions and the brevity and clarity necessary for optimal consumer comprehension and engagement. While space constraints are less severe in the context of payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts than in retail locations, the Bureau is still concerned that adding this information would affect this balance and risk information overload. In response to recommendations to make the statement more conspicuous, the Bureau believes that its relative length and position at the top of the short form disclosure already provide heightened conspicuousness.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 18(b)(2)(xiv)(A)-1 makes clear that financial institutions offering payroll card accounts may choose which of the two statements required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(A) to use in the short form disclosure. The list of options required in the second statement might include the following, as applicable: Direct deposit to the consumer's bank account, direct deposit to the consumer's own prepaid account, paper check, or cash. The comment also clarifies that a financial institution may, but is not required to, provide more specificity as to whom consumers must ask or inform of their choice of wage payment method, such as specifying the employer's Human Resources Department. The Bureau notes that, based on comments received, direct deposit to the consumer's own prepaid account is often not recognized as an option to receiving wages via the payroll card account for consumers. The Bureau believes that this is an important option of which consumers should be apprised, and has thus included it in comment 18(b)(2)(xiv)(A)-1 in the list of enumerated wage payment options when using the second version of the required statement.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 18(b)(2)(xiv)(A)-2 cross-references § 1005.15(c)(2)(i) for statement options for government benefit accounts. In response to commenter recommendation that the Bureau extend the notice requirement to other types of prepaid accounts, the Bureau declines to require such a statement for other types of prepaid accounts as it does not believe that to be necessary at this time. However, new comment 18(b)(2)(xiv)(A)-3 clarifies that a financial institution offering a prepaid account other than a payroll card account or a government benefit account may, but is not required to, include a statement in the short form disclosure regarding payment options that is similar to either of the statements required for payroll card accounts pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(A) or government benefit accounts pursuant to final § 1005.15(c)(2)(i). For example, a financial institution issuing a prepaid account to disburse student financial aid proceeds may disclose a statement such as the following: “You have several options to receive your financial aid payments: direct deposit to your bank account, direct deposit to your own prepaid card, paper check, or this prepaid card. Tell your school which option you choose.” The Bureau believes consumers would benefit from knowing their options and thus is clarifying that this disclosure may be provided by financial institutions for other types of prepaid accounts, but declines to require such a statement for other types of prepaid accounts as requested by some consumer group commenters.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(b)(2)(xii) Statement Regarding CFPB Web Site</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The proposed rule would have required financial institutions to disclose in proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">14</em>) the URL of the Web site of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, in a form substantially similar to the clauses set forth in proposed Model Forms A-10(a) through (d) and (f). In the proposal, the Bureau indicated that it intended to develop resources on its Web site that would, among other things, provide basic information to consumers about prepaid accounts, the benefits and risks of using them, how to use the final rule's prepaid account disclosures, and a URL to the Bureau's Web site where they can submit a complaint about a prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received comments from the office of a State Attorney General, an industry trade association, and a group advocating on behalf of business interests about this portion of the proposal. The office of the State Attorney General generally supported the disclosure while the trade association and business group recommended that the Bureau eliminate the disclosure. The industry trade association suggested that eliminating the disclosure would make room in the short form for information more valuable to consumers and reduce consumer confusion. It first asserted that the disclosure would not be necessary in bank branches because Bureau contact information was included in the proposed long form, which would be provided to consumers at the same time as the short form in a bank branch. Second, it said that the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing suggested consumers are unlikely to access the Bureau's Web site when reviewing the short form disclosure. Third, the commenter expressed concern about consumer confusion, stating that the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing suggested consumers would more likely access a financial institution's Web site for additional information about a prepaid account rather than obtaining more general information from the Bureau's Web site. Finally, it argued that listing both the financial institution's Web site and the Bureau's Web site on the short form disclosure would misdirect consumers, because in one of the rounds of the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing, half of the participants stated that they would go to the Bureau's Web site to get additional information about a particular prepaid card product.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The business group opposed including a link to the Bureau's Web site in both the short form and long form disclosures. It stated that the link to the Web site in the model short form disclosure was not yet an operating Web site, and therefore the commenter said it could not comment on the wisdom of directing consumers to this particular Bureau Web page. The commenter further suggested that requiring financial institutions to disclose the Bureau's Web site URL on the short form disclosure constituted Bureau interference with the purchasing process and would instill doubt in the consumer's mind about the safety of the prepaid account. It said it believed questions about prepaid accounts should be directed to the financial institution in the first instance, not to a regulatory agency.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">14</em>), renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(2)(xii), with minor modifications. The Bureau has moved the required language for this disclosure into the regulatory text, and has modified that language to specify that the disclosed Web site URL would provide consumers with general information about prepaid accounts. Finally, the Bureau has made technical modifications to the rule for conformity and clarity. Accordingly, final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xii) requires that financial institutions include in the short form a statement directing the consumer to a Web site URL of the Bureau (<em data-original="E-03">cfpb.gov/prepaid</em>) for general information about prepaid accounts, using the following clause or a substantially similar clause: “For general information about prepaid accounts, visit <em data-original="E-03">cfpb.gov/prepaid</em>.”</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is not persuaded by industry commenters' objections that this disclosure is unnecessary, inappropriate, or confusing. In the Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing of the short form disclosure, most participants understood that the Web site in this disclosure was administered by a government agency, not the financial institution, and that it would contain general information about prepaid accounts.<footnote ref="437">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report II at 12 and 22.</footnote>
             The Bureau continues to believe that it is important to provide consumers with a non-commercial alternative source of information about prepaid accounts to enhance consumers' ability to learn about prepaid accounts in general in order to better inform their purchase and use decisions.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>15(d)(2) Additional Access to Account Information Requirements</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1005.15(d)(2), which would have required that a government agency comply with the account information requirements as set forth in proposed § 1005.18(c)(2), (3), and (4). As discussed in more detail below, proposed § 1005.18(c)(2) would have required that the electronic and written histories in the periodic statement alternative include the information set forth in § 1005.9(b). This provision currently exists for payroll card accounts in existing § 1005.18(b)(2), but does not presently appear in § 1005.15 for government benefit accounts. Proposed § 1005.18(c)(3) would have required disclosure of all fees assessed against the account, in both the history of account transactions provided as periodic statement alternatives, as well as in any periodic statement. Proposed § 1005.18(c)(4) would have required disclosure, in both the history of account transactions provided as periodic statement alternatives, as well as in any periodic statement, monthly and annual summary totals of fees imposed on and the total amount of deposits and debits made to a prepaid account. Proposed comment 15(d)-1 would have referred to proposed comments 18(c)-1 through -5 for guidance on access to account information requirements.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive any comments specifically addressing § 1005.15(d)(2)'s application of the account information requirements in § 1005.18(c)(2) through (4) to government benefit accounts. Accordingly, the Bureau is finalizing § 1005.15(d)(2) as proposed with revised cross-references to reflect changes in the numbering of provisions within final § 1005.18(c). To further the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account consumers (including government benefit account consumers), the Bureau believes that it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to modify the periodic statement requirements of EFTA section 906(c) to require inclusion of all fees charged and summary totals of both monthly and annual fees. The Bureau believes that these revisions will assist consumers' understanding of the account activity on their government benefit accounts. In addition, the Bureau is also using its disclosure authority pursuant to section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act because it believes that disclosure of all fees and account activity summaries will ensure that the features of government benefit accounts, over the term of the account, are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with government benefit accounts.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes, however, that it is finalizing certain revisions to proposed § 1005.18(c)(2) through (4), renumbered as final § 1005.18(c)(3) through (5). Most significantly, the Bureau has removed the requirement that financial institutions provide summary totals of all deposits to and debits from a consumer's prepaid account from the final rule. The specific revisions and their respective rationales are discussed in the section-by-section analyses of § 1005.18(c)(3) through (5) below.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>15(d)(1) Periodic Statement Alternative</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.9(b), which implements EFTA section 906(c), generally requires a periodic statement for each monthly cycle in which an EFT occurred or, if there are no such transfers, a periodic statement at least quarterly.<footnote ref="346">The periodic statement must include transaction information for each EFT, the account number, the amount of any fees assessed, the beginning and ending account balance, the financial institution's address and telephone number for inquiries, and a telephone number for preauthorized transfers. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; § 1005.9(b).</footnote>
             Existing § 1005.15(c) explains that government agencies can provide periodic statements that comply with the general provisions in Regulation E, or alternatively, the agency must make available to the consumer: (1) The account balance, through a readily available telephone line and at a terminal (such as by providing balance information at a balance-inquiry terminal, or providing it, routinely or upon request, on a terminal receipt at the time of an EFT); and (2) a written history of account transactions that is provided promptly in response to an oral or written request and that covers at least 60 days.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to revise existing § 1005.15(c), renumbered as § 1005.15(d)(1), which would have allowed government agencies to instead provide access to account balance by telephone and at a terminal, 18 months of transaction history online, and 18 months written transaction history upon request. The Bureau believed that, to further the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account consumers (including government benefit account consumers), it was necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to continue the exception to the periodic statement requirements of EFTA section 906(c) for government benefit accounts and to modify that exception in Regulation E to more closely align it with the proposed requirements for prepaid accounts generally. See also the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(c)(1) below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.15(d)(1) and (1)(i) would have stated that a government agency need not furnish periodic statements required by § 1005.9(b) if the agency made available to the consumer the consumer's account balance, through a readily available telephone line and at a terminal (such as by providing balance information at a balance-inquiry terminal or providing it, routinely or upon request, on a terminal receipt at the time of an EFT). This language was unchanged from existing § 1005.15(c)(1). Existing § 1005.18(b)(1)(i) for payroll card accounts and proposed § 1005.18(c)(1)(i) for prepaid accounts, however, did not include the requirement to provide balance information at a terminal. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(c)(1)(i) below, the Bureau sought comment on whether a similar requirement to provide balance information at a terminal should be added to the requirements of proposed § 1005.18(c) for prepaid accounts generally, or whether, alternatively, the requirement should be eliminated from § 1005.15 given the other proposed enhancements and for parity with proposed § 1005.18.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Second, proposed § 1005.15(d)(1)(ii) would have required government agencies to provide an electronic history of the consumer's account transactions, such as through a Web site, that covered at least 18 months preceding the date the consumer electronically accessed the account. As noted above, the requirement to provide an electronic history of a consumer's account transactions was new for government benefit accounts. The Bureau did not believe that the proposed requirement would have imposed significant burden on government agencies, as the Bureau believed that many government benefit account programs already provided electronic access to account information.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Third, proposed § 1005.15(d)(1)(iii) would have required government agencies to provide a written history of the consumer's account transactions promptly in response to an oral or written request and that covered at least 18 months preceding the date the agency received the consumer's request. This provision was similar to existing § 1005.15(c)(2), but was modified to change the time period covered by the written history from 60 days to 18 months, and to otherwise mirror the language used in proposed § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii) for prepaid accounts generally.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>A consumer group commenter supported the Bureau's decision to apply the requirement to provide consumers access to a longer account history period to government agencies. A think tank commenter, on the other hand, objected to the decision, arguing that it would be difficult for government agencies to manage beneficiaries' account histories for 18 months. In addition, an industry trade association and an issuing bank opposed the Bureau's decision to maintain the requirement that government agencies wishing to take advantage of the periodic statement alternative provide consumers' account balance information at a terminal, arguing that terminal access was outdated and has been replaced by text or online account access. Two consumer groups, by contrast, supported the continued requirement for balance information at a terminal for government benefit accounts and urged the Bureau to expand the requirement to all prepaid accounts. They argued that ATMs are easy to use and that all consumers have access to ATM terminals, while not all consumers may have access to online account information.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting § 1005.15(d)(1) and comment 15(d)-1 largely as proposed, with minor revisions for consistency with final § 1005.18(c). To further the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account consumers (including government benefit account consumers), the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to continue the exception to the periodic statement requirements of EFTA section 906(c) for government benefit accounts and to modify that exception in Regulation E to more closely align it with the proposed requirements for prepaid accounts generally. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(c)(1) below, the Bureau has modified proposed § 1005.18(c)(1) to require 12 months of electronic account transaction history and 24 months of written account transaction history instead of 18 months for both as proposed. The Bureau has therefore modified § 1005.15(d)(1) accordingly. The Bureau believes that this revision strikes the appropriate balance between the burden imposed on industry overall while, in conjunction with final § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii) discussed below, ensuring that additional transaction history will be available for consumers who need it. Final comment 15(d)-1 cross-references final comments 18(c)-1 through -3 and -5 through -9 for further guidance on the access to account information requirements.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In response to the comment that the proposed 18-month access to account information requirements should not be extended to government benefit accounts, the Bureau is not convinced that there is a significant difference between the burden these requirements place on prepaid account issuers as financial institutions and the burden they place on government agencies, since, as the Bureau noted in the proposal, government benefit account programs are typically administered by financial institutions pursuant to a contract between the institution and the agency.<footnote ref="347">79 FR 77102, 77141 (Dec. 23, 2014). As it noted in the proposal, the Bureau has found that all the government benefit card programs included in its Study of Prepaid Account Agreements already provide online access to account information (&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; Study of Prepaid Account Agreements at 18 tbl.5), and, in most cases, electronic periodic statements as well (&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;see id.&lt;/em&gt; at 20 tbl.7).</footnote>
             With respect to the requirement that government agencies continue to provide account balances at terminal locations, the Bureau has considered the comments and is adopting § 1005.15(d)(1)(i) as proposed. The requirement is unchanged from existing § 1005.15(c)(1); recipients of government benefits may have come to rely on the ATM as a source of account information, and the Bureau does not see a need to remove this provision from the final rule. Relatedly, the Bureau notes that ATMs are still in wide use by consumers of various financial services products, and as such, it disagrees with commenters who argued that ATMs are an obsolete method of providing balance information to consumers. Furthermore, the Bureau understands that recipients of government benefits may be among the neediest consumers of prepaid accounts, and as such, may be less likely to have access to a mobile phone when they need it, such as prior to withdrawing money at the ATM. Having access to their balance at an ATM could help consumers in this scenario avoid costly fees. Finally, the Bureau notes that government agencies and financial institutions remain free under the final rule to recommend or encourage consumers to use particular modes of accessing their account balances.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>31(b)(1)(viii) Statements That Non-Covered Third-Party Fees or Taxes Collected on the Remittance Transfer by a Person Other Than the Provider May Apply</title>
      <analysisParagraph>In the December Proposal, the Bureau solicited comment on methods to reduce the burden of required disclosures of fees and taxes imposed on remittance transfers by persons other than the providers and alternative disclosures that could be provided.  Several industry and consumer group commenters suggested that in place of requiring exact or estimated disclosures of recipient institution fees or foreign taxes, the Bureau could require a statement within the disclosure forms alerting senders that the total amount received may be reduced by recipient institution fees or foreign taxes.  These commenters contended that such a disclosure would ensure that senders are aware of the potential for further reductions in the disclosed amount received, due to fees or taxes that are not disclosed, and would encourage senders and recipients to investigate the fees associated with a transfer to the recipient's financial institution, as compared to those associated with other mechanisms for sending a remittance transfer. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Although the Bureau is eliminating the requirement to calculate and disclose non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider, the Bureau strongly believes that it is nonetheless important to inform senders when fees and taxes that are not disclosed may apply to the remittance transfer.  Accordingly, to further the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes that it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to add § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii), which requires that a provider include, as applicable, a statement indicating that non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider may apply to the remittance transfer and result in the designated recipient receiving less than the amount disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii).  Moreover, under this paragraph, a provider may, but is not required to, disclose any applicable non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider using the language set for in Model Forms A-30(b)-(d) of Appendix A to this part or substantially similar language.  Any such figures must be disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be received, using the language set forth in Model Forms A-30(b) through (d) of Appendix A to this part, as appropriate, or substantially similar language.  The exchange rate used to calculate any disclosed non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider is the exchange rate used in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by § 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate.  Although new § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) makes the disclosure of the amount of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the provider optional, the Bureau believes that providers may be motivated to collect and disclose such information voluntarily, in the interest of providing high levels of customer service to senders and to better compete for remittance business against other providers. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 31(b)(1)(viii)-1 clarifies that if non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider apply to a particular remittance transfer, or if a provider does not know if such fees or taxes may apply to a particular remittance transfer, § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) requires the provider to include the disclaimer with respect to such fees and taxes.  Comment 31(b)(1)(viii)-1 additionally clarifies that required disclosures under § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) may only be provided to the extent applicable.  For example, if the designated recipient's institution is an agent of the provider and thus, non-covered third-party fees cannot apply to the transfer, the provider must disclose all fees imposed on the remittance transfer and may not provide the disclaimer regarding non-covered third-party fees.  In this scenario, the commentary clarifies, the provider may only provide the disclaimer regarding taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, as applicable. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 31(b)(1)(viii)-2 explains that § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) permits a provider to disclose the amount of any non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider.  For example, when a remittance transfer provider knows that the designated recipient's institution imposes a fee or that a foreign tax will apply, the provider may choose to disclose the relevant fee or tax as part of the information disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii).  The comment also notes that § 1005.32(b)(3) permits the provider to disclose estimated amounts of such taxes and fees, provided any estimates are based on reasonable source of information. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 32(b)(3)-1.  It further provides that where the provider chooses, at its option, to disclose the amounts of the relevant recipient institution fee or tax as part of the information disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii), the provider must not include that fee or tax in the amounts disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) or (b)(1)(vii).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Appendix A-7 Model Clauses for Financial Institutions Offering Prepaid Accounts (§ 1005.18(d) and (e)(3))</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Existing appendix A-7 provides model clauses for financial institutions that offer payroll card accounts; these clauses reflect the modifications made by the Payroll Card Rule to certain Regulation E provisions in existing § 1005.18. To reflect the proposed expansion of § 1005.18 to cover prepaid accounts, the Bureau proposed to revise the heading for existing appendix A-7 as well as the heading for paragraph (a) of appendix A-7. The Bureau also proposed to revise paragraph (a) of appendix A-7, which currently explains to consumers how to obtain account information for payroll card accounts, to change the term payroll card account to prepaid account, and to state that at least 18 months of electronic and written account transaction history is available to the consumer, rather than 60 days, as proposed in § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) and (iii). The Bureau also proposed to add a sentence at the end of paragraph (a) of appendix A-7 to inform consumers that they could not be charged for requesting such written account transaction history, unless requests were made more than once per month. As discussed above, the Bureau proposed to allow financial institutions to assess a fee or charge for subsequent requests for written account information made in a single calendar month, in proposed comment 18(c)-3.i.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau similarly proposed to revise the heading of paragraph (b), and to revise the text of paragraph (b) of appendix A-7, which currently sets forth model clauses regarding disclosure of error resolution procedures for financial institutions that provide alternative means of obtaining payroll card account information, to change the term payroll card account to prepaid account and to renumber the section citation in the heading.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also proposed to add a new paragraph (c) at the end of appendix A-7, for use by a financial institution that chooses, as explained in proposed comment 18(e)-4, not to comply with the liability limits and error resolution requirements in §§ 1005.6 and 1005.11 for prepaid accounts with respect to which it had not completed its collection of consumer identifying information and identity verification.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>This model language would have stated that it was important for consumers to register their prepaid accounts as soon as possible and that until a consumer registered the prepaid account, the financial institution was not required to research or resolve errors regarding the consumer's account. To register an account, the consumer was directed to a Web site and telephone number. The model language would have explained that the financial institution would ask for identifying information about the consumer (including full name, address, date of birth, and Social Security Number or government-issued identification number), so that it could verify the consumer's identity. Once the financial institution had done so, it would address the consumer's complaint or question as described earlier in appendix A-7.<footnote ref="556">The Bureau tested a version of this proposed model language with consumers. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report I at 23.</footnote>

      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive any comments specifically regarding the proposed revisions to appendix A-7. The Bureau is, however, making several revisions to the substantive provisions in § 1005.18(c) and (e) that correspond to the disclosures set forth in appendix A-7, and is revising appendix A-7 to reflect those changes. First, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(c) above, the Bureau is revising the proposed time periods that apply to a consumer's right to obtain account information. Under the final rule, consumers will have the right to access up to 12 months of account history online, instead of the 18 months of account history in the proposed rule. In addition, consumers will have the right to request at least 24 months of written transaction history, instead of the 18 months set forth in the proposed rule. The Bureau is revising paragraph (a) of appendix A-7 to reflect these changed time periods.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Second, under the final rule, the Bureau is no longer requiring a financial institution to provide 24 months of written account transaction history upon request, as required under § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii), for prepaid accounts (other than payroll card accounts or government benefit accounts) with respect to which the financial institution has not completed its consumer identification and verification process. To reflect this exception, the Bureau is adding bracketed language clarifying that the language in appendix A-7 informing consumers of their right to request 24 months of written account transaction history only applies to accounts that have been or can be registered with the financial institution.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Third, the Bureau is making several revisions to § 1005.18(e)(3), which, as proposed, would have limited a financial institution's obligation to provide limited liability and error resolution for accounts with respect to which the financial institution had not completed its collection of consumer identifying information and identity verification. Under the final rule, financial institutions must provide limited liability and error resolution protections for all prepaid accounts, regardless of whether the financial institution has completed its consumer identification and verification process with respect to the account. However, for accounts with respect to which the financial institution has not completed its identification and verification process (or for which the financial institution has no such process), the financial institution is not required to provisionally credit the consumer's account in the event the financial institution takes longer than 10 or 20 business days, as applicable, to investigate and determine whether an error occurred.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>To reflect these changes, the Bureau is revising paragraphs (b) and (c) of appendix A-7 as follows. The Bureau is revising the language in paragraph (b) describing a consumer's right to receive provisional credit in certain circumstances to reflect that, under the final rule, an account must be registered with the financial institution in order to be eligible for provisional credit. The Bureau is also revising paragraph (c), which under the final rule is only applicable to prepaid accounts that have a customer identification and verification process but for which the process is not completed before the account is opened (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> when the consumer must take an affirmative step to register the account after acquisition). Specifically, paragraph (c) is revised to reflect that, under the final rule, failure to register an account with the financial institution will not jeopardize a consumer's right to have an error investigated and resolved. Rather, as revised, final paragraph (c) explains that a consumer may not receive provisional credit while an error claim is pending on a prepaid account that has not been registered.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is otherwise adopting appendix A-7 as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Statement Regarding the Number of Additional Fee Types Charged Required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A)</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) requires a statement disclosing the number of additional fee types the financial institution may charge consumers with respect to the prepaid account, using the following clause or a substantially similar clause: “We charge [x] other types of fees.” The number of additional fee types disclosed must reflect the total number of fee types under which the financial institution may charge fees, excluding fees required to be disclosed pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (vii) and (5) and any finance charges as described in final Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11) imposed in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is finalizing § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii) because it continues to believe, as explained in the proposal, that it is crucial to inform consumers that there may be a cost for features not otherwise captured in the short form disclosure. Disclosure of this information will help both alert consumers that the short form is not a comprehensive fee disclosure and encourage consumers to seek out more information about the prepaid account from the long form disclosure and other sources. As noted in the proposal, the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing revealed that participants often did not know all the fees that might be assessed prior to their purchase of a prepaid account. In addition, the Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing revealed that, while not all participants understood the significance of the disclosure of the number of additional fee types, participants were keenly interested in this disclosure, which the Bureau believes will motivate consumers to seek more information about these additional fee types.<footnote ref="400">ICF Report II at 11-12 and 22.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau declines to use a more general statement to alert consumers that there may be additional fees, as requested by some industry commenters. The Bureau believes that disclosure of the specific number of additional fee types, as opposed to a general statement regarding other fees charged, provides consumers with concrete information and stronger motivation to both better inform themselves and to direct their searches for additional information. Moreover, as discussed below, the Bureau believes that focusing the disclosure on tallying the <em data-original="E-03">types</em> of fees rather than counting each variation in fees toward the total directly addresses industry's concerns that disclosing a specific number of other fees would prompt consumers to assign undue negative weight to the fact that a product may have many fee variations. The change to fee types also helps reduce compliance burden across the two related disclosures of the number of additional fee types required by this provision and the disclosure of additional fee types required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau disagrees with commenters that the comprehensive disclosure of all fees in another disclosure, such as the long form or the cardholder agreement, negates the rationale for disclosing the number of additional fee types in the short form. The Bureau believes that consumers generally would rely solely on the short form disclosure in making their acquisition decisions if they do not see language that specifically emphasizes the value of consulting the long form. The Bureau thus believes that listing the total number of fee types that are not otherwise listed on the short form will complement and enhance the statement in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiii) directing consumers to the long form, providing a concrete incentive to consult the longer disclosure for products that are more complex.<footnote ref="401">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report II at 12 and 22.</footnote>
             Specifically, the Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing revealed that, when asked how they could learn more about “other fees” not shown on the short form, practically all participants referred to the financial institution's telephone number and Web site disclosed on the prototype short form disclosure (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the information sources required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiii)).<footnote ref="402">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
             In sum, the Bureau believes that the disclosure of the number of additional fee types in the short form pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii) will directly inform consumers of important information and serve to spur them to further inquiry in other more detailed disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau acknowledges commenters' concerns that some consumers may tend to assume that a prepaid account with a relatively high number of additional fees is more expensive or less desirable than other accounts, even when the opposite may be true. In part to address this concern, the Bureau is finalizing the rule requiring financial institutions to disclose the total number of <em data-original="E-03">fee types,</em> rather than the total number of all <em data-original="E-03">fees</em> (including all fee variations within a fee type) that would have been required under the proposal. Requiring disclosure of the number of fee types instead of the number of discrete fees likely will reduce the number required to be disclosed for a typical prepaid account program. The Bureau believes that this modification for the final rule should help ameliorate the risk raised by some commenters that consumers will reject prepaid accounts with a high number of additional fees out of hand without seeking more detailed fee information to determine whether the products meet their needs. Moreover, the requirements for both final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii) and (ix) are based on fee types (as opposed to one being based on discrete fees and the other on fee types), thereby reducing the burden of developing and maintaining two separate counts to determine and disclose the elements under their respective rules. The Bureau is also providing a list of fee types and fee variations in final comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-2, discussed below—which are based on fees that the Bureau is aware exist in the current prepaid marketplace—that a financial institution may use when determining both the number of additional fee types charged pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) and any additional fee types to disclose pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). The Bureau believes that these provisions will reduce the risks and burdens raised by commenters concerning the proposed disclosure of the total number of fees not otherwise listed, while still providing the consumer with an important signal and incentive to investigate prepaid accounts that have more complex pricing structures.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau believes that this modification addresses commenters' concerns, at least in part, regarding a potential chill to innovation of new features because such fee variations within a fee type will not be required to be separately counted for purposes of this disclosure. The Bureau intends to monitor compliance with this rule, including financial institutions' disclosures of the number of additional fee types charged, as well as market innovations in the prepaid industry more generally, and will consider additional action in future rulemakings if necessary.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Modifying the final rule to require disclosure of the number of fee types also addresses concerns raised by some commenters that the proposed disclosure would have included many fees that are not commonly incurred by consumers—including fees for discretionary features that require specific consumer action before they are incurred. For example, under the final rule, a financial institution would count bill payment as an additional fee type if it offered this feature, but, unlike the rule as proposed, would not count each of the discrete fee variations within bill payment such as ACH bill payment, paper check bill payment, check cancellation, and regular or expedited delivery of a paper check. Thus, in addition to a reduction in the overall number of additional fees required to be disclosed under the final rule, a financial institution would similarly not be required to disclose many of the less common fees and fees triggered by affirmative consumer action. While some of the additional fee types required to be disclosed in the final rule may still be less common or triggered only when a consumer elects to use an optional service, the Bureau reiterates that the primary objective of this provision is to alert consumers to fee information absent from the short form and to spur consumers to take action to gain a more fulsome understanding of the terms of a prospective prepaid account; this disclosure fulfils this objective.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) below, the Bureau is adopting a de minimis threshold with respect to the disclosure of specific additional fee types. The Bureau does not believe a de minimis threshold would be appropriate for the disclosure required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) regarding the total number of additional fee types. The Bureau notes, however, that with the de minimis threshold in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix), disclosure of such fee types under final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) would not be required, although such fee types would be counted in the total number of additional fee types disclosed pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau continues to believe it is not necessary to include in the final rule specific requirements for updating the statement regarding the number of additional fee types charged required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A). As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b) above, the Bureau does not believe that financial institutions change the fee schedules for prepaid accounts often, particularly those sold at retail. If a financial institution is making available a new optional service for all prepaid accounts in a particular prepaid account program, Regulation E provides a means for financial institutions to notify consumers of terms associated with a new EFT service that is added to a consumer's account, in § 1005.7(c). A financial institution may provide new consumer disclosures in accordance with § 1005.7(c) post-acquisition, without needing to pull and replace card packaging that does not reflect that new optional feature in the disclosure of the number of additional fee types pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A). The Bureau does expect, however, that financial institutions will keep their other disclosures up to date (including those provided electronically and orally, as well as disclosures provided in writing that are not a part of pre-printed packaging materials, such as those printed by a financial institution upon a consumer's request). The Bureau intends to monitor financial institutions' practices in this area, however, and may consider additional requirements in a future rulemaking if necessary.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Final comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-1 clarifies what fee types to count in the total number of additional fee types, specifically excluding fees otherwise required to be disclosed in and outside the short form pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (vii) and (5) and any finance charges as described in final Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11) imposed in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in final § 1026.61. Excluding the static fees and fees required to be disclosed outside the short form avoids the duplicative counting of fees already disclosed to the consumer. As discussed in more detail below, the Bureau has made a strategic decision to focus the bulk of the short form disclosure on usage of the prepaid account itself rather than any charges related to overdraft credit features. The possibility that consumers may be offered an overdraft credit feature for use in connection with the prepaid account is addressed in the short form pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(x), which requires the following statement if such a feature may be offered: “You may be offered overdraft/credit after [x] days. Fees would apply.” Consistent with this overall decision, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to exclude any finance charges related to an overdraft credit feature that may be offered at a later date to some prepaid consumers from the disclosures regarding additional fees under both final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii) and (ix). If consumers are interested in such a feature, they can look to the Regulation Z disclosures in the long form pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(4)(vii), discussed below, for more details.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Final comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-1.i explains that the number of additional fee types includes only fee types under which the financial institution may charge fees; accordingly, third-party fees are not included unless they are imposed for services performed on behalf of the financial institution. The comment additionally clarifies that the number of additional fee types includes only fee types the financial institution may charge consumers with respect to the prepaid account; accordingly, additional fee types does not include other revenue sources such as interchange fees or fees paid by employers for payroll card programs, government agencies for government benefit programs, or other entities sponsoring prepaid account programs for financial disbursements.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Final comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-1.ii explains that fee types that bear a relationship to, but are separate from, the static fees disclosed in the short form must be counted as additional fee types for purposes of final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii). The comment also provides a detailed explanation regarding the treatment of international ATM fees and fees for reloading funds into a prepaid account in a form other than cash (such as electronic reload and check reload). In addition, the comment explains that additional fee types disclosed in the short form pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) must be counted in the total number of additional fee types. This is because the exclusions in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) and (<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) are only for fees required to be disclosed pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (vii) and (5) and any finance charges imposed on the prepaid account as described in Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in Regulation Z § 1026.61. Further, the statement required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(B) explains that the additional fee types disclosed are some of the total number of additional fee types.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting new comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-2 to provide guidance regarding the calculation of the number of additional fee types pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii) as well as to address concerns raised by an industry commenter regarding how to categorize fees in determining the additional fee types to disclose under final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). The comment explains that the term fee type, as used in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii) and (ix), is a general category under which a financial institution charges fees to consumers. A financial institution may charge only one fee within a particular fee type, or may charge two or more variations of fees within the same fee type. (The Bureau notes that an additional fee type for which a financial institution does not charge any fee to the consumer, including for any variations of the additional fee type, is not counted in the total number of additional fee types under final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii) nor required to be disclosed on the short form under final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix).) The comment goes on to provide a list of examples of fee types a financial institution may use when determining both the number of additional fee types charged pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) and any additional fee types to disclose pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). The comment also explains that a financial institution may create an appropriate name for other additional fee types.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau compiled the list of examples of fee types in new comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-2 to provide guidance to financial institutions and to help facilitate their categorization of additional fee types for satisfying the requirements in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) and (ix). The list also may encourage standardization of this portion of the short form in that, although additional fee types disclosed will vary across short forms for different prepaid account programs, the Bureau believes financial institutions will generally use consistent nomenclature for additional fee types identified on the list. The Bureau compiled this list of examples of fee types based on particular fee types referenced in comments received on the proposal and by reviewing the packaging of and disclosures for scores of prepaid account programs.<footnote ref="403">As part of the Bureau's Study of Prepaid Account Agreements, Bureau staff found fee tables or other explanations of at least some of the fees charged for 278 of the 325 agreements reviewed. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Study of Prepaid Account Agreements at 29 and note 49.</footnote>
             The Bureau balanced multiple considerations in compiling the list in final comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-2 for purposes of both final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii) and (ix), including existing industry practices with regard to fee types, the accounting burdens associated with relatively narrower or broader definitions of fee types, and the potential benefits to both industry and consumers in using narrower definitions of fee types to communicate information about specific account features and fees. The Bureau believes the resulting list strikes an appropriate balance by capturing categories and terms employed by the prepaid industry itself that will be useful to financial institutions and consumers in determining and understanding additional fee types. The Bureau is providing flexibility to financial institutions to fashion appropriate names for other fee types, including fee types for services that do not yet exist in the prepaid marketplace.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Final comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-3 clarifies that, pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(vi), a financial institution using the multiple service plan short form disclosure pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) must disclose only the fee for calling customer service via a live agent. Thus, pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii), any charge for calling customer service via an interactive voice response system must be counted in the total number of additional fee types.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Final comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-4 clarifies that a financial institution must use the same categorization of fee types in the number of additional fee types disclosed pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii) and in its determination of which additional fee types to disclose pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). The Bureau is including this comment on consistency to make clear that a financial institution is not permitted to, for example, shorten its list of fee types into a few broad categories (in order to minimize the number of additional fee types required to be disclosed pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)) but use a more detailed list of fee types broken out into a greater number of categories when assessing its obligations under final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) (in order to maximize the number of fee types that may fall below the de minimis threshold pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>)).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>33(b) Notice of Error From Sender</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(b) set forth the timing and content requirements for a notice of error provided by a sender in connection with a remittance transfer. Consistent with EFTA section 919(d)(1)(A), proposed § 205.33(b)(1)(i) stated that a sender must provide a notice of error orally or in writing to the remittance transfer provider no later than 180 days after the date of availability of the remittance transfer stated in the receipt or combined disclosure. Under proposed § 205.33(b)(1)(ii), such notice of error must enable the remittance transfer provider to identify: the sender's name and telephone number or address; the recipient's name, and if known, the telephone number or address of the recipient; and the remittance transfer to which the notice of error applies. Proposed § 205.33(b)(1)(iii) stated that the notice must also indicate why the sender believes the error exists and include to the extent possible the type, date, and amount of the error, except in the case of requests for documentation, additional information, or clarification under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(v).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters suggested that the time period for senders to assert an error is too long. Some industry commenters recommended that the time period be shortened to 60 days, similar to the time period that consumers have to assert errors for EFTs. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.11(b)(3). Other industry commenters suggested 30 days. The Bureau notes that the 180-day time period for senders to assert an error is expressly stated in the statute. Given the international nature of remittance transfers, the additional time a sender may need to communicate with persons abroad, and the lack of information about problems associated with this time period, the Bureau does not believe that using its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to change this time period is currently warranted.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters also requested that the sender be required to assert an error in writing at a centralized address. The Bureau believes that requiring senders to assert an error in writing would have a chilling effect on the error resolution process, especially given that some senders may not feel comfortable writing in English. Although in some cases, a sender may have the ability to assert the error in a foreign language and be assured a response in that language, that ability may depend on the foreign languages used at the office of the remittance transfer provider where the error is asserted to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers under § 1005.31(g), as discussed above. Moreover, the current error resolution process for EFTs does not require a consumer to assert an error in writing.<footnote ref="81">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; § 1005.11(b). Although a financial institution may request that a consumer assert the error in writing, a consumer's failure to do so does not cancel the error resolution process, but gives the financial institution 45 days to investigate the error without having to provide provisional credit. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; § 1005.11(b)(2) and (c)(2).</footnote>
             Therefore, the Bureau declines to make the requested change, and proposed § 205.33(b)(1) is adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(b)(1).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(b)(2) provided that when a notice of error was based on documentation, additional information, or clarification that the sender had previously requested under § 1005.33(a)(1)(v), the sender's notice of error would be timely if it were received by the provider no later than 60 days after the provider sends the requested documentation, information, or clarification. As the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the proposed 60-day time frame for the sender to provide a new notice of error following the sender's receipt of documentation, information, or clarification from the remittance transfer provider is consistent with the 60-day time frame established for similar circumstances under the general error resolution provisions in Regulation E, § 1005.11(b)(3).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with the Board's reasoning that under these circumstances, 60 days, rather than the 180-day error resolution time frame generally applicable to remittance transfers, provides sufficient time for a sender to review the additional information provided by the remittance transfer provider and determine whether an error occurred in connection with a transfer. The Bureau did not receive any comments on this issue. However, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to clarify that a sender always has the original 180 days after the disclosed date of availability to assert an error. Consequently, the Bureau is amending proposed § 205.33(b)(2), renumbered as § 1005.33(b)(2), to provide that when a notice of error is based on documentation, additional information, or clarification that the sender had previously requested under § 1005.33(a)(1)(v), the sender's notice of error is timely if received by the remittance transfer provider the later of 180 days after the disclosed date of availability of the remittance transfer or 60 days after the provider sent the documentation, information, or clarification requested.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed commentary to clarify proposed § 205.33(b). Proposed comment 33(b)-1 clarified that the error resolution procedures for remittance transfers apply only when a notice of error is received from the sender of the transfer. Thus, a notice of error provided by the designated recipient would not trigger the remittance transfer provider's error resolution obligations. As the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, this interpretation is consistent with EFTA section 919(d)(1)(A), which establishes error resolution obligations for a remittance transfer provider only when a notice is received from the sender.<footnote ref="82">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See also&lt;/em&gt; EFTA section 919(g)(1) (providing that a designated recipient “shall not be deemed to be a consumer for purposes of this Act”).</footnote>
             Proposed comment 33(b)-1 also clarified that the error resolution provisions do not apply when the remittance transfer provider itself discovers and corrects an error. The Bureau did not receive any comments on the proposed comment, which the Bureau adopts as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed comment 33(b)-2 to provide that a notice of error is effective so long as the remittance transfer provider is able to identify the remittance transfer in question. As explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, a sender could provide in the notice of error the confirmation number or code given to the sender for the pick-up of a remittance transfer to identify the particular transfer in their tracking systems and records, or any other identification number or code supplied by the provider in connection with the remittance transfer, if such number or code is sufficient to enable the provider to identify the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter requested that, for an account-based remittance transfer, the final rule require senders to include the account number in the notice of error. The Bureau notes that under comment 11(b)(1)-1 for EFTs, consumers are not required to provide their account numbers and need only provide sufficient information to enable the financial institution to identify the account. Similarly, the Bureau believes that a sender need not provide the account number, but must provide enough information such that the remittance transfer provider can identify the account and the transfer in question. The Bureau adopts comment 33(b)-2 with this clarification, and also makes other clarifying changes to comment 33(b)-2 to make the comment consistent with § 1005.33(b)(1).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 33(b)-3 provided that a remittance transfer provider may request, or the sender may provide, an email address of the sender or the designated recipient, as applicable, instead of a physical address if the email address would be sufficient to enable the provider to identify the remittance transfer to which the notice applies. Proposed comment 33(b)-4 provided that if the sender fails to provide a timely notice of error within 180 days from the stated date of delivery, the remittance transfer provider would not be required to comply with the error resolution requirements set forth in the rule. As the Board noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, proposed comment 33(b)-4 is similar to comment 11(b)(1)-7 for EFTs. The Bureau did not receive any comments on these proposed comments. Therefore, the Bureau adopts comment 33(b)-3 substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>However, given that a sender may provide a second notice of error based on documentation, additional information, or clarification that the sender requested pursuant to § 1005.33(b)(2), as discussed above, the Bureau is revising comment 33(b)-4 to include the time periods relevant to § 1005.33(b)(2). Consequently, comment 33(b)-4 provides that, if applicable, a remittance transfer provider is not required to comply with the error resolution requirements for any notice of error from a sender that is received by the provider more than 60 days after a provider sent documentation, additional information, or clarification requested by the sender, provided such date is later than 180 days after the disclosed date of availability.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed comment 33(b)-5 to provide that a notice of error from a sender received by a remittance transfer provider's agent is deemed to be received by the provider for purposes of the 180-day time frame for reporting errors under § 1005.33(b)(1)(i). Some industry commenters suggested that senders should only be permitted to assert an error at a centralized address or telephone number. These commenters noted that because remittance transfers are not the primary business for most or all of the agents of a remittance transfer provider, relying on an agent to properly forward disputes and relevant supporting documents to the remittance transfer provider would impose unnecessary costs on agents. Commenters also argued that introducing agents into the error resolution process would increase the likelihood that disputes would not be handled and resolved in a timely way.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As the Board noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, a sender that has a problem or issue with a particular remittance transfer may contact the agent location that the sender used to send the transfer to resolve the problem or issue, rather than notifying the provider directly. The Bureau agrees with the Board that because in many cases, for transfers sent through money transmitters, it will be the agent with whom the sender has a direct relationship, and not the provider, it is appropriate to treat a notice of error given to the agent as notice to the provider. This approach also ensures that a sender does not lose his or her error resolution rights merely because the sender was unaware of a need to directly notify the provider. This is consistent with the approach the Bureau is taking with respect to a sender asserting his or her right to cancel, as discussed in further detail below in comment 34(a)-4. Moreover, the Bureau notes that the comment does not require the agent to perform the error resolution procedures. Remittance transfer providers may require their agents to pass on any error notice they receive to the remittance transfer providers, who can then fulfill the requirements of § 1005.33. Therefore, the Bureau adopts proposed comment 33(b)-5 substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, proposed comment 33(b)-6 cross-referenced the disclosure requirements in § 205.31 to reiterate that a remittance transfer provider must include an abbreviated notice of the consumer's error resolution rights on the receipt under § 205.31(b)(2) or combined disclosure under § 205.31(b)(3), as applicable. In addition, the proposed comment provided that the remittance transfer provider must make available to a sender upon request, a notice providing a full description of error resolution rights that is substantially similar to the model error resolution and cancellation notice set forth in Appendix A of this regulation (Model Form A-36). The Bureau did not receive any comments on the proposed comment. The Bureau adopts comment 33(b)-6 substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>33(a) Definition of Error</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Definition of Error Generally</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(a)(1) defined the term “error” for purposes of the remittance transfer error resolution provisions. Proposed § 205.33(a)(2) listed types of transfers or inquiries that do not constitute errors. The proposed commentary provided additional guidance illustrating errors under the rule.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters generally believed the proposed error definitions were overly broad because they would subject a remittance transfer provider to liability for errors caused by parties outside the control of the provider. Some of these commenters suggested that requiring providers to assume responsibility for errors when the provider has not erred nor controlled the circumstances that caused the error would undermine the safety and soundness of these transfer systems and could lead some financial institutions to eliminate remittance transfer services. Other industry commenters predicted that the financial impact of losses experienced as a result of errors caused by another party could be significant enough for providers to exit the market.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is amending certain error definitions in response to these comments, as discussed below. In general, under a number of financial consumer protection laws, the regulated entity has the responsibility to investigate errors asserted by consumers and generally assumes much of the liability when an error has occurred even where neither the regulated entity nor the consumer are at fault. <em data-original="E-03">See, e.g.,</em> 15 U.S.C. 1693f and 1693g; 15 U.S.C. 1643; 12 CFR 1005.11; and 12 CFR 1026.13. Thus, consistent with other error resolution procedures in Federal financial consumer protection laws, the Bureau believes that where neither a sender nor a remittance transfer provider are necessarily at fault, a provider generally is in a better position than a sender to identify, and possibly recover from, the party at fault.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, placing liability with the remittance transfer provider in these instances aligns the remittance transfer provider's incentives with those of the sender. Remittance transfer providers are likely better able to work with parties in the remittance transfer system or government entities to reduce errors to remittance transfers overall. Placing responsibility on providers increases the incentives of providers to develop such policies, procedures, and controls. As a result, the Bureau does not believe that whether a particular circumstance constitutes an error should necessarily depend on whether a provider is at fault. The Bureau further notes that this is similar to the approach taken in defining “errors” under § 1005.11 for EFTs where something may be considered an “error” even if the financial institution did not cause the error.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>33(a)(1) Types of Transfers or Inquiries Covered</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(a)(1) listed the types of transfers or inquiries that would constitute “errors.” Each type of transfer or inquiry that constitutes an “error” is discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>33(a)(1)(i) Incorrect Amount Paid by Sender</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(i) defined “error” to include an incorrect amount paid by a sender in connection with a remittance transfer. This element of the definition is similar to the error described in § 1005.11(a)(1)(ii) of an incorrect EFT to or from a consumer's account. The Board also proposed comment 33(a)-1 to clarify that proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(i) was intended to cover circumstances in which the amount paid by the sender differs from the total amount of the transaction stated in the receipt or the combined disclosure. Proposed comment 33(a)-1 also stated that an error under § 205.33(a)(1)(i) covered incorrect amounts paid by a sender regardless of the form or method of payment tendered by the sender for the transfer, including when a debit, credit, or prepaid card is used to pay an amount in excess of the amount of the transfer requested by the sender plus applicable fees.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Commenters did not specifically address proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(i) or proposed comment 33(a)-1. The Bureau adopts proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(i) substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(a)(1)(i). The Bureau also adopts comment 33(a)-1 substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>33(a)(1)(ii) Computational or Bookkeeping Error</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(ii), an “error” also included “a computational or bookkeeping error made by a remittance transfer provider relating to a remittance transfer.” This provision is similar to an existing computational or bookkeeping error provision for EFTs in § 1005.11(a)(iv). In implementing this provision of Regulation E, the Board noted that § 1005.11(a)(iv) (formerly § 205.11(a)(iv)) is intended to include “arithmetical errors, posting errors, errors in printing figures, and figures that were jumbled due to mechanical or electronic malfunction.” <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 44 FR 59480 (Oct. 15, 1979). Proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(ii) was meant to cover similar types of errors with respect to remittance transfers, such as circumstances in which a remittance transfer provider fails to reflect all fees that will be imposed in connection with the transfer or misapplies the applicable exchange rate in calculating the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient. As noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, notwithstanding that the designated recipient may receive the amount of currency stated on the receipt or combined disclosure, an error could be asserted because the provider incorrectly calculated the amount that should have been received. The Bureau did not receive any comments on proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(ii). The Bureau adopts this provision as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(a)(1)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>33(a)(1)(iii) Incorrect Amount Received by the Designated Recipient</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iii) to provide that an “error” generally included the failure by a remittance transfer provider to make available to a designated recipient the amount of currency identified in the receipt or combined disclosure given to the sender, unless the disclosure provided an estimate made in accordance with proposed § 205.32 (adopted as § 1005.32 above). The Board also proposed guidance in comment 33(a)-2 regarding the scope of the error under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iii). Furthermore, proposed comment 33(a)-3 provided examples illustrating circumstances in which an incorrect amount of currency may be received by a designated recipient.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter recommended that the exclusion of estimated disclosures made pursuant to § 1005.32 from the definition of “error” under renumbered § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) should be applied to other errors listed in § 1005.33(a)(1). The Bureau notes, however, that none of the other errors in § 1005.33(a)(1) rely on the difference between what may be disclosed as an estimate and the actual amount. For example, suppose a remittance transfer is permitted to estimate disclosures under § 1005.32. If the remittance transfer provider fails to deliver any funds to the designated recipient, the sender should be able to assert an error even though the provider disclosed an estimate. As a result, the Bureau declines to make the requested change, and the exclusion of estimated disclosures made pursuant to § 1005.32 is adopted as renumbered § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii)(A).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau has added language to clarify that the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii)(A) from the definition of “error” applies if the difference results from application of the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes, rather than any estimated amounts. This clarification prevents a remittance transfer provider from relying on the exception for estimates if it makes available to the designated recipient an amount that is completely unrelated to the amount calculated using the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes. For example, if the remittance transfer provider estimated the amount to be received pursuant to § 1005.32 as 1,200 pesos in the receipt or combined disclosure, and the amount calculated using the applicable actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes is 1,150 pesos, the provider cannot use the § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii)(A) exception to claim that there is no error if it made only 100 pesos available to the designated recipient.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail below, several industry commenters requested expansion of the exception to the error defined in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) for extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated. The Bureau believes that it is appropriate to provide this exception for an error involving an incorrect amount received by the designated recipient. For example, suppose a foreign government in the country where a remittance transfer is to be delivered imposes an emergency tax on the transfer that was not in effect nor could have been reasonably anticipated at the time the provider was required to give the sender the receipt or combined disclosure. The failure to make available to the designated recipient the amount of currency identified in the receipt or combined disclosure given to the sender, which did not reflect the emergency tax, should not constitute an error if the designated recipient received the disclosed amount of currency less the emergency tax.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As a result, new § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii)(B) provides that the failure to make the amount of currency stated in the receipt or combined disclosure is not an error if the failure resulted from extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated. Furthermore, the Bureau adopts new comment 33(a)-4 to provide guidance on what types of extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated qualify for the exception. The comment is similar to the comment adopted as comment 33(a)-6 below, which describes extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated for purposes of the error for failure to make funds available by the disclosed date of availability in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 33(a)-2 is adopted with a change to clarify that if a provider rounds the exchange rate used to calculate the amount received consistent with § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) and comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-2 for the disclosed rate, there is no error if the designated recipient receives an amount of currency that results from applying the exchange rate used, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate, to calculate fees, taxes, and the amount received rather than the disclosed rate. The change is intended to be consistent with the Bureau's general approach to rounding exchange rates as described above in the supplementary information to comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-2. Proposed comment 33(a)-3 is adopted substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>33(a)(1)(iv) Failure To Make Funds Available by Date of Availability</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv) generally defined an “error” to include a remittance transfer provider's failure to make funds in connection with a remittance transfer available to the designated recipient by the date of availability stated on the receipt or combined disclosure, subject to two specified exceptions, discussed below. The Board proposed comment 33(a)-4 to provide examples of the circumstances that would have been considered errors under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv). These circumstances included: (i) The late delivery of a remittance transfer after the stated date of availability or non-delivery of the transfer; (ii) the deposit of a remittance transfer to the wrong account; (iii) retention of the transferred funds by a recipient agent or institution after the stated date of availability, rather than making the funds available to the designated recipient; and (iv) the fraudulent pick-up of a remittance transfer in a foreign country by a person other than the person identified by the sender as the designated recipient of the transfer. Fraudulent pick-up, however, did not include circumstances in which a designated recipient picks up a remittance transfer from the provider's agent as authorized, but subsequently the funds are stolen from the recipient.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters objected to the inclusion of fraudulent pick-up as an error. These commenters suggested that the remittance transfer provider should not be responsible for fraud that results in the pick-up of a remittance transfer by a person other than the designated recipient where the provider is unlikely to know or have control over all the intermediary institutions involved in the transfer or the final institution that will make the funds available to the designated recipient. Other commenters, including the OCC, suggested that this error might result in “friendly fraud” where a sender claims the amount was not an authorized pick-up when the pick-up was actually legitimate. The OCC was also concerned that the exposure to remittance transfer providers for this error may be aggravated in situations involving large dollar remittances and because of the long period of time that a sender could assert this error.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter noted that while there may be certain instances when fraudulent pick-up should be considered an error, there may be other circumstances when fraudulent pick-up should not be an error. In particular, this commenter suggested that where the name of the person picking up the funds does not match the name of the designated recipient set forth in the receipt, the sender should be able to assert an error. However, if an individual presents fake identification in the name of the designated recipient, this commenter stated that this fraudulent pick-up is outside of the remittance transfer provider's control and therefore, should not be considered an error. Industry commenters also believed that a remittance transfer provider should not be liable for a fraudulent pick-up when a provider and its agent has complied with fraud and risk management policies and procedures.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As the Board noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, treating fraudulent pick-up of a remittance transfer as an error is consistent with the scope of unauthorized EFTs under § 1005.2(m), which includes unauthorized EFTs initiated through fraudulent means. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 2(m)-3. Although identity theft can present a challenge to remittance transfer providers, financial institutions face similar challenges with respect to unauthorized EFTs and bear most of the risk. Moreover, similar to remittance transfers, the entity in the best position to verify the identity of the person initiating the EFT (for example, the merchant at a store who initiates an EFT using a debit card) may not be known or controlled by the financial institution, though such entities may have agreed to abide by system rules (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> payment card network rules, ACH system rules). However, under current laws governing EFTs, whether the financial institution knows or has control over that entity (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> a merchant) does not affect whether an EFT could be an unauthorized EFT. Similarly, the Bureau believes that whether a fraudulent pick-up should be considered an error should not be affected by the relationship between the remittance transfer provider and the entity distributing the remittance transfer to the designated recipient.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, the Bureau agrees with the Board's reasoning in the May 2011 Proposed Rule that it is appropriate to treat these circumstances as errors because the remittance transfer provider, rather than the sender, is in the best position to ensure that a remittance transfer is picked up only by the person designated by the sender. For example, in some models, remittance transfer providers could require or contract with the entity distributing the funds, if it is not the remittance transfer provider itself, to request and examine identification from the person picking up the funds. The Bureau believes that including fraudulent pick-up as an error would better align the remittance transfer provider's incentives to prevent this occurrence with the interests of the sender.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter suggested that a sender be required to inform the remittance transfer provider if the confirmation number or receipt is lost or stolen. For some remittance transfer providers, a designated recipient is required to give the confirmation number, which is generally printed on the receipt, in order to obtain access to the funds in a remittance transfer. The commenter suggested that this approach would be similar to the approach taken with respect to a lost or stolen access device in § 1005.6(b) with respect to unauthorized EFTs, where a consumer's liability for unauthorized EFTs is dependent on how quickly the consumer reports the lost or stolen access device to the account-holder financial institution.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes, however, the risk for a lost or stolen confirmation number is not the same as for a lost or stolen access device for EFTs. A lost or stolen access device could potentially be used to initiate an EFT by a person who is not the account holder immediately without an accomplice and without identification matching the name associated with the access device. By contrast, where a confirmation number given to the sender is lost or stolen, an unauthorized person who gains access to the number would not be able to take advantage of it unless he or she were located or had an accomplice in the recipient country. Furthermore, because access to funds sent by a remittance transfer provider is often limited to those with identification matching the designated recipient on the receipt, an unauthorized person who gains access to a lost or stolen confirmation number may be deterred from taking advantage of it. Consequently, the Bureau does not believe that a sender's liability should depend on whether he or she reports a confirmation number or receipt as lost or stolen.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Moreover, under § 1005.6(b), a consumer's liability for unauthorized EFTs is dependent on how quickly the consumer reports the lost or stolen access device because the speed with which a consumer reports the lost or stolen access device may be critical to preventing further unauthorized EFTs and further losses, and the possibility of increased liability provides incentives for a consumer to report quickly. In contrast, a lost or stolen confirmation number would not result in losses other than the specific remittance transfer in question. Therefore, the Bureau also does not believe that a sender's liability should depend on how quickly a sender reports a lost or stolen confirmation number.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting comment 33(a)-4, renumbered as comment 33(a)-5, generally as proposed. Specifically, the Bureau is including a statement to clarify that if only a portion of the funds were made available by the disclosed date of availability, then § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) does not apply, but § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) may apply instead.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisSection>
          <title>Exceptions to the Failure To Make Funds Available by Date of Availability</title>
          <analysisParagraph>As noted above, the proposed rule provided two exceptions to the definition of “error” in proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv). Under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(A), the failure to make funds from a remittance transfer available by the stated date of availability did not constitute an error if the failure resulted from circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control. Under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(B), the failure to make funds from a remittance transfer available on the stated date of availability did not constitute an error if it was caused by the sender providing incorrect information in connection with the remittance transfer to the provider, so long as the provider gives the sender the opportunity to correct the information and resend the transfer at no additional cost. The Bureau adopts one of these two exceptions with changes to respond to commenters' concerns, as discussed below. The other exception has been moved to the remedies section under § 1005.33(c)(2) for the reasons discussed below. The Bureau is also adopting two additional exceptions to the definition of “error” in proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv).</analysisParagraph>
        </analysisSection>
        <analysisSection>
          <title>Exception for Extraordinary Circumstances Outside of the Remittance Transfer Provider's Control</title>
          <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(A) provided that the failure to make funds from a remittance transfer available by the stated date of availability did not constitute an error if the failure resulted from circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control. Proposed comment 33(a)-5 clarified that the exception was limited to circumstances that are generally referred to under contract law as force majeure, or uncontrollable or extraordinary circumstances that cannot be reasonably anticipated by the remittance transfer provider and that prevent the provider from delivering a remittance transfer, such as war, civil unrest, or a natural disaster. The proposed comment also provided that the exception for circumstances beyond a provider's control covered government actions or other restrictions that occur after the transfer has been sent but that could not have been reasonably anticipated by the remittance transfer provider, such as the imposition of foreign currency controls or the garnishment or attachment of funds.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters stated that the proposed comment limiting the circumstances beyond the provider's control to instances of force majeure or to other uncontrollable or extraordinary circumstances was too narrow. Several industry commenters recommended that the exception should be more broadly interpreted to exclude errors caused by acts of a third party beyond a remittance transfer provider's control. Consumer group commenters believed the approach in the proposed rule was a reasonable limitation and recommended that the commentary specifically state that mistakes by a recipient institution do not fall under the exception to the error to deliver funds by the date of delivery. Other consumer group commenters suggested that the final rule limit the circumstances even further to only include acts of war or terrorism or natural disaster.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau does not believe that whether a particular circumstance constitutes an error or not should necessarily depend on whether a provider is at fault. Even if the error is caused by a third party beyond the remittance transfer provider's control, the Bureau believes that the remittance transfer provider is often in a better position to identify and recover the loss from the third party than a sender, especially when there are multiple intermediary institutions involved in a transfer. Accordingly, the Bureau believes that with respect to third-party errors, the circumstances in proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(A) should include only a narrow category of third-party errors caused by uncontrollable or extraordinary circumstances that cannot be reasonably anticipated by the remittance transfer provider and that prevent the provider from delivering a remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, the Bureau believes the proposed comment is appropriately narrow in interpreting the limited set of circumstances for which the failure to make funds available by the disclosed date of delivery should not be an error. Therefore, proposed comment 33(a)-5 is adopted substantially as proposed in comment 33(a)-6. The Bureau is adopting proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(A) generally as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(A). However, the Bureau is adding language to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(A) to more accurately reflect the descriptions of the types of circumstances listed in comment 33(a)-6. Specifically, § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(A) provides that a failure to make funds available by the disclosed date of delivery is not an error if the failure resulted from extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated.</analysisParagraph>
        </analysisSection>
        <analysisSection>
          <title>Exception for Sender Providing Incorrect or Insufficient Information</title>
          <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(B) provided that the failure to make funds from a remittance transfer available on the stated date of availability did not constitute an error if it was caused by the sender providing incorrect information in connection with the remittance transfer to the provider, so long as the provider gives the sender the opportunity to correct the information and resend the transfer at no additional cost. Proposed comment 33(a)-6 clarified that if the failure to make funds from a transfer available by the stated date of availability occurred due to the <em data-original="E-03">provider's</em> miscommunication of information necessary for the designated recipient to pick up the transfer, such as providing the incorrect location where the transfer may be picked up or providing the wrong confirmation number or code for the transfer, such failure would have been treated as an error under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv).</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters objected to the requirement that the remittance transfer provider absorb the costs of amending and resending a transfer when the sender is at fault. These commenters noted that modifying transfers can be expensive and that the proposed rule would, in effect, require the remittance transfer provider and other senders, through higher fees, to bear the responsibility for a sender's mistake.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with commenters that a sender's mistake should not obligate a remittance transfer provider to bear all the costs for resending the remittance transfer. However, the Bureau believes that while the remittance transfer provider should not bear all the costs in these circumstances, the failure should still be considered an error such that the error resolution procedures apply. Therefore, the Bureau is moving the concept in proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(B) to a new § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), and proposed comment 33(a)-6 to renumbered comment 33(c)-2, as discussed further below.</analysisParagraph>
        </analysisSection>
        <analysisSection>
          <title>Additional Exceptions</title>
          <analysisParagraph>In the final rule, the Bureau is adding two additional exceptions to the definition of “error” in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) based on a consideration of comments received. New § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(B) provides that delays in making funds available to a designated recipient that are related to a provider's fraud screening procedures or in accordance with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), 31 U.S.C. 5311 <em data-original="E-03">et seq.,</em> Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) requirements, or similar laws or requirements would not constitute an error. Several industry commenters and the OCC noted that for fraud screening, BSA, or OFAC purposes, a remittance transfer provider may have further communications with the sender to ensure the legitimacy or the legality of a remittance transfer. This, in turn, may cause delays in making the funds available to a designated recipient. The Bureau believes it is appropriate to exclude these situations from the definition of “error” in order to encourage remittance transfer providers to continue to engage in activities that benefit the safety of the transfer system as a whole. The Bureau understands that under current procedures, these types of delays are generally infrequent, relative to the number of remittance transfers typically conducted by remittance transfer providers.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adopting a new § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C) in response to industry commenters' and the OCC's concerns about “friendly fraud.” Consequently, consistent with the definition of “unauthorized electronic fund transfer” under § 1005.2(m), and as suggested by the OCC to address its concerns regarding the error of fraudulent pick-up, § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C) provides an exception to the “error” definition for remittance transfers made with fraudulent intent by the sender or any person in concert with the sender. Therefore, if a sender is involved in a scheme to defraud the remittance transfer provider, for example, by fraudulently claiming that the designated recipient did not pick up funds that the designated recipient in fact did pick up, such action would not be considered an “error” under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C).</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>33(a)(1)(v) Sender's Request for Documentation</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(v), an error included a sender's request for documentation provided in connection with a remittance transfer or additional information or clarification concerning a remittance transfer. This provision is similar to an existing provision in § 1005.11(a)(1)(vii) for EFTs. As the Board noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, an error under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(v) would also cover a sender's request for information to determine whether an error exists. The Bureau did not receive any comments on proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(v). The Bureau adopts proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(v) substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(a)(1)(v).</analysisParagraph>

        <title>33(a)(2) Types of Inquiries and Transfers Not Covered</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(a)(2) listed circumstances that would not constitute errors. In particular, proposed § 205.33(a)(2)(i) provided that an inquiry about a transfer of $15 or less does not constitute an error, since these small-value transfers do not fall within the scope of the definition of “remittance transfer.” <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.30(e)(2), discussed above. Under proposed § 205.33(a)(2)(ii), an inquiry about the status of a remittance transfer—for example, if the sender calls to ask whether the funds have been made available in the foreign country—would also not be an error (unless the funds have not been made available by the disclosed date of availability). Finally, similar to § 1005.11(a)(2)(ii) for EFTs, a sender's request for information for tax or other recordkeeping purposes would not constitute an error under proposed § 205.33(a)(2)(iii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that because transfers of $15 or less are not “remittance transfers” under § 1005.30(e)(2), such transfers are not covered under the remittance transfer provisions in subpart B. Therefore, the Bureau believes it is not necessary to state that an inquiry involving a transfer of $15 or less is not an error, and is not adopting proposed § 205.33(a)(2)(i). A Federal Reserve Bank commenter noted that for certain assertions of error that exceed the $15 threshold, providers may still not have the ability to investigate the assertion because they are less than the minimum amount traceable in a foreign country. In order to ensure that senders are protected with respect to errors related to remittance transfers other than truly <em data-original="E-03">de minimis</em> amounts, however, the Bureau is not inclined to create another threshold amount above the $15 coverage threshold for which an inquiry is not an error. The Bureau did not receive comments on proposed § 205.33(a)(2)(ii) or (iii). These provisions are adopted as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(a)(2)(i) and (ii), respectively.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In the final rule, the Bureau is adopting provisions describing two other circumstances that do not constitute errors in response to comments received. Section 1005.33(a)(2)(iii) provides that a change requested by the designated recipient is not an error. Comment 33(a)-7 clarifies new § 1005.33(a)(2)(iii) by providing that the exception is available only if the change is made solely because the designated recipient requested the change. The comment also includes an illustrative example. The example explains that if a sender requests a remittance transfer provider to send US$100 to a designated recipient at a designated location, but the designated recipient requests the amount in a different currency (either at the sender-designated location or another location requested by the recipient) and the remittance transfer provider accommodates the recipient's request, the change does not constitute an error.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau understands that as a service to the recipient, a remittance transfer provider may offer to provide the remittance transfer in a different currency or permit the transfer to be picked up at a location different than originally requested by the sender. In such cases, the Bureau believes that this type of customer service should be preserved. The Bureau, however, is concerned that remittance transfer providers may try to provide the remittance transfer to the designated recipient in a different currency simply because the provider or its agent do not have sufficient amounts of the sender-requested currency on hand. Therefore, the Bureau believes that this exception should only be available if the change is made solely because the designated recipient requested the change.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.33(a)(2)(iv) is also new and provides that an error does not include a change in the amount or type of currency received by the designated recipient from the amount or type of currency stated in the disclosure provided to the sender under § 1005.31(b)(2) or (3) if the remittance transfer provider relied on information provided by the sender as permitted by the commentary accompanying § 1005.31 in making such disclosure. As discussed above, a remittance transfer provider may rely on the sender's representations in making certain disclosures. For example, a remittance transfer provider can rely on the representations of the sender regarding the currency that can be provided in the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 33(a)-8 elaborates on the exclusion by providing two illustrative examples. Under one example, a sender requests U.S. dollars to be deposited into an account of the designated recipient and represents that the account is U.S. dollar-denominated. If the designated recipient's account is actually denominated in local currency and the recipient account-holding institution must convert the remittance transfer into local currency in order to deposit the funds and complete the transfer, the change in currency does not constitute an error pursuant to § 1005.33(a)(2)(iv). Similarly, if the remittance transfer provider relies on the sender's representations regarding variables that affect the amount of taxes imposed by a person other than the provider for purposes of determining these taxes, the change in the amount of currency the designated recipient actually receives due to the taxes actually imposed does not constitute an error pursuant to § 1005.33(a)(2)(iv).</analysisParagraph>

        <title>33(b) Notice of Error From Sender</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(b) set forth the timing and content requirements for a notice of error provided by a sender in connection with a remittance transfer. Consistent with EFTA section 919(d)(1)(A), proposed § 205.33(b)(1)(i) stated that a sender must provide a notice of error orally or in writing to the remittance transfer provider no later than 180 days after the date of availability of the remittance transfer stated in the receipt or combined disclosure. Under proposed § 205.33(b)(1)(ii), such notice of error must enable the remittance transfer provider to identify: the sender's name and telephone number or address; the recipient's name, and if known, the telephone number or address of the recipient; and the remittance transfer to which the notice of error applies. Proposed § 205.33(b)(1)(iii) stated that the notice must also indicate why the sender believes the error exists and include to the extent possible the type, date, and amount of the error, except in the case of requests for documentation, additional information, or clarification under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(v).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters suggested that the time period for senders to assert an error is too long. Some industry commenters recommended that the time period be shortened to 60 days, similar to the time period that consumers have to assert errors for EFTs. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.11(b)(3). Other industry commenters suggested 30 days. The Bureau notes that the 180-day time period for senders to assert an error is expressly stated in the statute. Given the international nature of remittance transfers, the additional time a sender may need to communicate with persons abroad, and the lack of information about problems associated with this time period, the Bureau does not believe that using its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to change this time period is currently warranted.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters also requested that the sender be required to assert an error in writing at a centralized address. The Bureau believes that requiring senders to assert an error in writing would have a chilling effect on the error resolution process, especially given that some senders may not feel comfortable writing in English. Although in some cases, a sender may have the ability to assert the error in a foreign language and be assured a response in that language, that ability may depend on the foreign languages used at the office of the remittance transfer provider where the error is asserted to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers under § 1005.31(g), as discussed above. Moreover, the current error resolution process for EFTs does not require a consumer to assert an error in writing.<footnote ref="81">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; § 1005.11(b). Although a financial institution may request that a consumer assert the error in writing, a consumer's failure to do so does not cancel the error resolution process, but gives the financial institution 45 days to investigate the error without having to provide provisional credit. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; § 1005.11(b)(2) and (c)(2).</footnote>
             Therefore, the Bureau declines to make the requested change, and proposed § 205.33(b)(1) is adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(b)(1).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(b)(2) provided that when a notice of error was based on documentation, additional information, or clarification that the sender had previously requested under § 1005.33(a)(1)(v), the sender's notice of error would be timely if it were received by the provider no later than 60 days after the provider sends the requested documentation, information, or clarification. As the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the proposed 60-day time frame for the sender to provide a new notice of error following the sender's receipt of documentation, information, or clarification from the remittance transfer provider is consistent with the 60-day time frame established for similar circumstances under the general error resolution provisions in Regulation E, § 1005.11(b)(3).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with the Board's reasoning that under these circumstances, 60 days, rather than the 180-day error resolution time frame generally applicable to remittance transfers, provides sufficient time for a sender to review the additional information provided by the remittance transfer provider and determine whether an error occurred in connection with a transfer. The Bureau did not receive any comments on this issue. However, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to clarify that a sender always has the original 180 days after the disclosed date of availability to assert an error. Consequently, the Bureau is amending proposed § 205.33(b)(2), renumbered as § 1005.33(b)(2), to provide that when a notice of error is based on documentation, additional information, or clarification that the sender had previously requested under § 1005.33(a)(1)(v), the sender's notice of error is timely if received by the remittance transfer provider the later of 180 days after the disclosed date of availability of the remittance transfer or 60 days after the provider sent the documentation, information, or clarification requested.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed commentary to clarify proposed § 205.33(b). Proposed comment 33(b)-1 clarified that the error resolution procedures for remittance transfers apply only when a notice of error is received from the sender of the transfer. Thus, a notice of error provided by the designated recipient would not trigger the remittance transfer provider's error resolution obligations. As the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, this interpretation is consistent with EFTA section 919(d)(1)(A), which establishes error resolution obligations for a remittance transfer provider only when a notice is received from the sender.<footnote ref="82">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See also&lt;/em&gt; EFTA section 919(g)(1) (providing that a designated recipient “shall not be deemed to be a consumer for purposes of this Act”).</footnote>
             Proposed comment 33(b)-1 also clarified that the error resolution provisions do not apply when the remittance transfer provider itself discovers and corrects an error. The Bureau did not receive any comments on the proposed comment, which the Bureau adopts as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed comment 33(b)-2 to provide that a notice of error is effective so long as the remittance transfer provider is able to identify the remittance transfer in question. As explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, a sender could provide in the notice of error the confirmation number or code given to the sender for the pick-up of a remittance transfer to identify the particular transfer in their tracking systems and records, or any other identification number or code supplied by the provider in connection with the remittance transfer, if such number or code is sufficient to enable the provider to identify the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter requested that, for an account-based remittance transfer, the final rule require senders to include the account number in the notice of error. The Bureau notes that under comment 11(b)(1)-1 for EFTs, consumers are not required to provide their account numbers and need only provide sufficient information to enable the financial institution to identify the account. Similarly, the Bureau believes that a sender need not provide the account number, but must provide enough information such that the remittance transfer provider can identify the account and the transfer in question. The Bureau adopts comment 33(b)-2 with this clarification, and also makes other clarifying changes to comment 33(b)-2 to make the comment consistent with § 1005.33(b)(1).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 33(b)-3 provided that a remittance transfer provider may request, or the sender may provide, an email address of the sender or the designated recipient, as applicable, instead of a physical address if the email address would be sufficient to enable the provider to identify the remittance transfer to which the notice applies. Proposed comment 33(b)-4 provided that if the sender fails to provide a timely notice of error within 180 days from the stated date of delivery, the remittance transfer provider would not be required to comply with the error resolution requirements set forth in the rule. As the Board noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, proposed comment 33(b)-4 is similar to comment 11(b)(1)-7 for EFTs. The Bureau did not receive any comments on these proposed comments. Therefore, the Bureau adopts comment 33(b)-3 substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>However, given that a sender may provide a second notice of error based on documentation, additional information, or clarification that the sender requested pursuant to § 1005.33(b)(2), as discussed above, the Bureau is revising comment 33(b)-4 to include the time periods relevant to § 1005.33(b)(2). Consequently, comment 33(b)-4 provides that, if applicable, a remittance transfer provider is not required to comply with the error resolution requirements for any notice of error from a sender that is received by the provider more than 60 days after a provider sent documentation, additional information, or clarification requested by the sender, provided such date is later than 180 days after the disclosed date of availability.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed comment 33(b)-5 to provide that a notice of error from a sender received by a remittance transfer provider's agent is deemed to be received by the provider for purposes of the 180-day time frame for reporting errors under § 1005.33(b)(1)(i). Some industry commenters suggested that senders should only be permitted to assert an error at a centralized address or telephone number. These commenters noted that because remittance transfers are not the primary business for most or all of the agents of a remittance transfer provider, relying on an agent to properly forward disputes and relevant supporting documents to the remittance transfer provider would impose unnecessary costs on agents. Commenters also argued that introducing agents into the error resolution process would increase the likelihood that disputes would not be handled and resolved in a timely way.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As the Board noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, a sender that has a problem or issue with a particular remittance transfer may contact the agent location that the sender used to send the transfer to resolve the problem or issue, rather than notifying the provider directly. The Bureau agrees with the Board that because in many cases, for transfers sent through money transmitters, it will be the agent with whom the sender has a direct relationship, and not the provider, it is appropriate to treat a notice of error given to the agent as notice to the provider. This approach also ensures that a sender does not lose his or her error resolution rights merely because the sender was unaware of a need to directly notify the provider. This is consistent with the approach the Bureau is taking with respect to a sender asserting his or her right to cancel, as discussed in further detail below in comment 34(a)-4. Moreover, the Bureau notes that the comment does not require the agent to perform the error resolution procedures. Remittance transfer providers may require their agents to pass on any error notice they receive to the remittance transfer providers, who can then fulfill the requirements of § 1005.33. Therefore, the Bureau adopts proposed comment 33(b)-5 substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, proposed comment 33(b)-6 cross-referenced the disclosure requirements in § 205.31 to reiterate that a remittance transfer provider must include an abbreviated notice of the consumer's error resolution rights on the receipt under § 205.31(b)(2) or combined disclosure under § 205.31(b)(3), as applicable. In addition, the proposed comment provided that the remittance transfer provider must make available to a sender upon request, a notice providing a full description of error resolution rights that is substantially similar to the model error resolution and cancellation notice set forth in Appendix A of this regulation (Model Form A-36). The Bureau did not receive any comments on the proposed comment. The Bureau adopts comment 33(b)-6 substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Statement Directing Consumers To Disclosure of Additional Fee Types Required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(B)</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(B) requires that, if a financial institution makes a disclosure of specific additional fee types pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix), the financial institution must include a statement directing consumers to that disclosure, located after but on the same line of text as the statement regarding the number of additional fee types required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A), using the following clause or a substantially similar clause: “Here are some of them:”.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The disclosure required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) indicating the number of additional fee types will generally be followed by the specific disclosure of two additional fee types pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). The Bureau believes that a brief transition statement linking these two disclosures will enhance consumer understanding of both disclosures and dispel potential consumer misunderstanding that features are not offered if they are not disclosed on the short form.<footnote ref="404">See the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) below discussing industry commenters' concern that disclosure of the proposed incidence-based fees would mislead consumers into thinking that features are not offered if they are not disclosed as incidence-based fees.</footnote>
             Thus, the line in the short form disclosure following the static fees would disclose the following or substantially similar clauses: “We charge X other types of fees. Here are some of them:”.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) below, the Bureau believes that the brevity and clarity of the short form disclosure necessary for optimal consumer comprehension and engagement cannot support a detailed explanation of what additional fee types are or the criteria the financial institution used in determining which additional fee types to disclose. The Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing of such explanations support this conclusion.<footnote ref="405">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report I at 35 and ICF Report II at 22-23.</footnote>
             Pre-proposal testing of a statement intended to inform consumers that the fees listed were those that generated significant revenue for the financial institution resulted in minimal participant comprehension or notice.<footnote ref="406">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report I at 35. (Certain prototype short form disclosures tested included the statement: “The fees below generate significant revenue for this company.”)</footnote>
             Post-proposal testing of a similar disclosure that, in addition to including an explanation of the criteria for disclosing such fees (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> that the two fees listed were the most commonly charged), also directed consumers where to find detail about all fees, similarly did not increase participant comprehension.<footnote ref="407">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report II at 22-23. (Certain prototype short form disclosures tested included the statement: “We charge [x] additional fees. Details on fees inside the package, at 800-234-5678 or at &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;bit.ly/XYZprepaids&lt;/em&gt;. These are our most common:”.)</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Thus, to make the connection for consumers that the additional fee types disclosed pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) are a subset of the number of additional fee types disclosed pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A), and that absence of any feature on the short form does not necessarily mean the prepaid account program does not offer that feature, the Bureau is including in the final rule the transition statement set forth above.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Final comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(B)-1 provides guidance regarding the statement required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(B) directing consumers to the disclosure of additional fee types pursuant final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). The comment explains that a financial institution that makes no disclosure pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) may not include a disclosure pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(B). The comment also provides examples regarding substantially similar clauses a financial institution may use in certain circumstances to make its disclosures under final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) and (B), such as when a financial institution has several additional fee types but is only required to disclose one of them pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>33(g) Error Resolution Standards and Recordkeeping Requirements</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to EFTA section 919(d)(2), the Bureau must establish clear and appropriate standards for remittance transfer providers with respect to error resolution relating to remittance transfers, to protect senders from such errors. EFTA section 919(d)(2) specifically provides that such standards must include appropriate standards regarding recordkeeping, including retention of certain error-resolution related documentation. The Board proposed § 205.33(g) to implement these error resolution standards and recordkeeping requirements.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Specifically, proposed § 205.33(g)(1) provided that a remittance transfer provider must develop and maintain written policies and procedures that are designed to ensure compliance with respect to the error resolution requirements applicable to remittance transfers. The proposed rule also stated that remittance transfer providers must take steps to ensure that whenever a provider uses an agent to perform any of the provider's error resolution obligations, the agent conducts such activity in accordance with the provider's policies and procedures. As noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, this approach is similar to one taken by the Federal banking agencies in other contexts. <em data-original="E-03">See, e.g.,</em> 12 CFR 1022.90(e) (requiring that an identity theft red flags program exercise appropriate and effective oversight of service-provider arrangements).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter suggested that the failure to maintain written policies and procedures should not be an independent cause of action. The Bureau believes that remittance transfer providers must develop written policies and procedures in order to demonstrate compliance to the appropriate regulator. Therefore, the Bureau does not believe the requirement to maintain written policies and procedures that the remittance transfer provider must follow imposes any additional burden.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is making one change to proposed § 205.33(g)(1). Specifically, the Bureau is deleting the provision in proposed § 205.33(g)(1) that requires remittance transfer providers to take steps to ensure that when a provider uses an agent to perform any of the provider's error resolution obligations, the agent conducts such activity in accordance with the provider's policies and procedures. The Bureau believes that this provision is no longer necessary in light of the decision under § 1005.35, discussed below, to provide that a remittance transfer provider is liable for any violation of subpart B by an agent when such agent acts for the provider. Proposed § 205.33(g)(1), as revised, is adopted in renumbered § 1005.33(g)(1).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Under proposed § 205.33(g)(2) a remittance transfer provider's policies and procedures concerning error resolution would be required to include provisions regarding the retention of documentation related to an error investigation. Such provisions would be required to ensure, at a minimum, the retention of any notices of error submitted by a sender, documentation provided by the sender to the provider with respect to the alleged error, and the findings of the remittance transfer provider regarding the investigation of the alleged error, which is consistent with EFTA section 919(d)(2).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 33(g)-1 clarified that remittance transfer providers are subject to the record retention requirements under § 1005.13, which apply to any person subject to the EFTA. Accordingly, remittance transfer providers would be required to retain documentation, including documentation related to error investigations, for a period of not less than two years from the date a notice of error was submitted to the provider or action was required to be taken by the provider. Similar to comment 13-1, proposed comment 33(g)-1 provided that the record retention requirements do not require a remittance transfer provider to maintain records of individual disclosures of remittance transfers that it has provided to each sender. Instead, a provider need only retain records to ensure that it can comply with a sender's request for documentation or other information relating to a particular remittance transfer, including a request for supporting documentation to enable the sender to determine whether an error exists with respect to that transfer. The Bureau did not receive any comments on proposed § 205.33(g)(2) or proposed comment 33(g)-1. The Bureau adopts proposed § 205.33(g)(2) substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(g)(2), but with an amendment to make clear that remittance transfer providers are subject to the record retention requirements under § 1005.13. The Bureau also adopts comment 33(g)-1 with amendments to conform the comment to comment 13-1 and to the changes in § 1005.33(g)(2).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>33(f) Relation to Other Laws</title>
      <analysisParagraph>As the Board noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the error resolution rights for remittance transfers exist independently from other rights that a consumer may have under other existing Federal law. Proposed § 205.33(f) contains guidance regarding the interplay between the error resolution provisions for remittance transfers and error resolution rights that may exist under other applicable consumer financial protection laws.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed § 205.33(f)(1) to implement the provision in EFTA section 919(e)(1) regarding the applicability of the remittance transfer error resolution provisions to EFTs. The proposed rule provided that if an alleged error in connection with a remittance transfer involved an incorrect EFT to a sender's account and the account was also held by the remittance transfer provider, then the requirements of proposed § 205.33, and its applicable time frames and procedures, governed the error resolution process. If the notice of error was asserted with an account-holding institution that was not the same entity as the remittance transfer provider, however, proposed § 205.33(f)(1) provided that the error resolution procedures under § 205.11 (currently § 1005.11), and not those under § 205.33, would apply to the account-holding institution's investigation of the alleged error.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>An electronic fund transfer from a consumer's account may also be a remittance transfer. But, as the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, an account-holding institution would likely be unable to identify a particular EFT as a remittance transfer unless it was also the remittance transfer provider. In the absence of direct knowledge that a particular EFT was used to fund a remittance transfer, the account-holding institution would face significant compliance risk if the error resolution requirements under proposed § 205.33 were deemed to apply to the error.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with the Board that such an outcome would be undesirable. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 205.33(f)(1) in renumbered § 1005.33(f)(1) to permit an account-holding institution to comply with the error resolution requirements of § 1005.11 when the institution is not also the remittance transfer provider for the transaction in question. In such a case, the sender will also have independent error resolution rights against the remittance transfer provider itself under § 1005.33.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters thought the proposed guidance was confusing and would apply more than one error resolution procedure to a remittance transfer provider. Although certain remittance transfer providers may have multiple error resolution obligations, these provisions are meant to resolve conflicts and provide greater certainty about which error resolution provisions apply in certain situations. Therefore, the Bureau is revising comment 33(f)-1 to provide such clarification.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Revised comment 33(f)-1 provides that a financial institution that is also the remittance transfer provider may have error obligations under both §§ 1005.11 and 1005.33. The comment provides examples to illustrate when certain error resolution procedures apply to a remittance transfer provider that is also the account-holding institution from which the transfer is funded. In the first example, a sender asserts an error under § 1005.11 with a remittance transfer provider that holds the sender's account, and the error is not also an error under § 1005.33, such as an omission of an EFT from a periodic statement. In this case, the error-resolution provisions of § 1005.11 exclusively apply to the error. In the second example, a sender asserts an error under § 1005.33 with a remittance transfer provider that holds the sender's account, and the error is also an error under § 1005.11, such as when the amount the sender requested to be deducted from the sender's account and sent for the remittance transfer differs from the amount that was actually deducted from the account and sent. In this case, the error-resolution provisions of § 1005.33 exclusively apply to the error.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(f)(2) addressed the scenario where the consumer provides a notice of error to the creditor that issued the credit card with respect to an alleged error involving an incorrect extension of credit in connection with a remittance transfer, such as when a consumer provides a credit card to pay for a remittance transfer. Proposed § 205.33(f)(2) provided that, in such a case, the error resolution provisions of Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.13, would apply to the creditor, rather than the requirements under proposed § 205.33. Proposed § 205.33(f)(2) also stated that if the sender instead provides a notice of error asserting an incorrect payment amount involving the use of a credit card to the remittance transfer provider, then the error resolution provisions of proposed § 205.33 would apply to the remittance transfer provider.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>A creditor of a credit card or other credit account may also act as a remittance transfer provider in certain circumstances, such as when a cardholder sends funds from his or her credit card through a service offered by the creditor to a recipient in a foreign country. In this case, an error could potentially be asserted under either Regulation Z or the error resolution provisions applicable to remittance transfers in the case of an incorrect extension of credit in connection with the transfer. The Board proposed that under these circumstances, the error resolution provisions under Regulation Z § 1026.13 would apply to the alleged error, but solicited comment on the proposed approach.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One commenter suggested that if a remittance transfer provider is serving multiple roles, such as a creditor that is also a remittance transfer provider, the remittance transfer provider should have the ability to choose which error resolution procedure to follow. The Bureau does not believe that remittance transfer providers should be permitted to choose the error resolution procedure to apply because providers and senders would benefit from the application of consistent procedures in similar situations.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with the Board that it is reasonable to apply the Regulation Z error resolution provisions under circumstances where the remittance transfer provider is also the creditor because Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.13(d)(1) permits a consumer to withhold disputed amounts while an error is being investigated. However, the Bureau believes that the additional time afforded to a sender to assert an error under § 1005.33 may also be of value. Therefore, for a remittance transfer provider that is also the creditor, the Bureau is requiring that the time period to assert an error under § 1005.33(b) should apply instead of the time period under 12 CFR 1026.13(b). This will also ensure that the error resolution notice required under § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) is consistent. Otherwise, disclosing to a sender that the time period to assert an error may in some instances be 60 days from the periodic statement reflecting the error and in other instances may be 180 days from the disclosed date of availability on the remittance transfer receipt could be confusing.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also believes further clarification is warranted for errors other than incorrect extensions of credit in connection with the remittance transfer. For example, an error involving an incorrect amount of currency received under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) or the failure to make funds available by the disclosed date of availability under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) may be asserted as an error involving goods or services that have not been delivered as agreed under § 1026.13(a)(3). Accordingly, the Bureau is adding these references to the final rule to resolve any potential conflicts. The Bureau adopts § 205.33(f)(2) in renumbered § 1005.33(f)(2) with these revisions and amendments to clarify that the provision applies to all credit accounts rather than only credit card accounts.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau notes that in certain circumstances, a credit cardholder has a right to assert claims or defenses against a card issuer concerning property or services purchased with a credit card under Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.12(c)(1). These rights are independent of other billing error rights a cardholder may have. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 12(c)-1 to 12 CFR 1026.12(c). Therefore, the Bureau is adopting a new comment 33(f)-2 to clarify that to the extent a credit cardholder has a right to assert claims and defenses against a card issuer under 12 CFR 1026.12(c)(1), nothing in § 1005.33 limits a sender's right in this regard.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Board also proposed § 205.33(f)(3) to provide guidance where an alleged error involves an unauthorized EFT or unauthorized use of a credit card to send a remittance transfer, such as when a stolen debit or credit card is used to send funds to a foreign country. Specifically, proposed § 205.33(f)(3) clarified that the consumer would have rights under Regulation E §§ 1005.6 and 1005.11 in the case of an unauthorized EFT or Regulation Z §§ 1026.12(b) and 1026.13 in the case of an unauthorized use of a credit card. However, since the consumer holding the asset account or the credit card account is not the sender of the remittance transfer, proposed § 205.33(f)(3) stated that the error resolution provisions for remittance transfers would not apply. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 33(b)-1. The Bureau agrees with the Board's proposal, and § 205.33(f)(3) is adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(f)(3) with an amendment to clarify application of the provision to credit accounts generally as opposed to only credit card accounts.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters suggested that the reasoning the Board used in applying Regulation E §§ 1005.6 and 1005.11 in the case of an unauthorized EFT and Regulation Z §§ 1026.12(b) and 1026.13 in the case of an unauthorized use of a credit card, should be used in applying UCC Article 4A provisions to an unauthorized wire transfer. As discussed above in the supplementary information to § 1005.30(e), UCC Article 4A-108 provides that Article 4A does not apply “to a funds transfer, <em data-original="E-03">any part of which is governed by the [EFTA]”</em> (emphasis added). Furthermore, as discussed above, the Bureau may only preempt State law to the extent that there is an inconsistency. Since the Bureau does not believe there is an inconsistency between the EFTA and UCC Article 4A-108, UCC Article 4A does not apply to wire transfers that are remittance transfers under § 1005.30(e). Therefore, the Bureau declines to implement commenters' suggestion with respect to unauthorized wire transfers.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Board noted that in certain cases a consumer may be able to assert error resolution rights in connection with a remittance transfer with both the remittance transfer provider as well as the account-holding institution or credit card issuer or creditor. Proposed comment 33(f)-2 addressed this situation by providing that if a sender receives credit to correct an error of an incorrect amount paid in connection with a remittance transfer from either the remittance transfer provider or the sender's account-holding institution or creditor, and then subsequently asserts the same error with the other party, the other party would have no further responsibilities to investigate the error. The proposed comment also clarified that an account-holding institution or creditor may reverse amounts it has previously credited to correct an error if the consumer receives more than one credit to correct the same error and provided an example to illustrate this concept.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter noted that the provisions in § 1005.33(f) could provide a consumer with potentially different error resolution procedures depending on who the consumer decides to contact. This may be the case if the remittance transfer provider is not also the account-holding institution or creditor. However, proposed comment 33(f)-2 explains that the second party has no error resolution obligations if the sender already received credit to correct an error of an incorrect amount paid in connection with a remittance transfer. This comment makes clear that a consumer may not receive a windfall by successfully asserting an error with both the provider and the account-holding institution and/or credit card issuer or creditor.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Another industry commenter suggested that the remittance transfer provider should be permitted to delay providing a remedy until expiration of the card issuer's chargeback right under network rules to prevent duplicate recoveries when remittances are funded by a debit card or a credit card. The Bureau believes that the delay would be disadvantageous for senders in getting a speedy resolution to an error and that proposed comment 33(f)-2 is a better method for dealing with the possibility of duplicate recoveries. The Bureau adopts this comment, renumbered as comment 33(f)-3, substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Lastly, the Bureau received comment from an industry commenter questioning which error resolution provisions apply when a sender has multiple funding sources for the remittance transfer. For example, a sender could fund a remittance transfer partly by a balance in the sender's account held by the remittance transfer provider and partly by a credit card or an ACH transfer from the sender's checking account. In such cases, the Bureau notes that which error resolution procedure will apply depends on the error that is asserted. For example, if the error asserted is the incorrect extension of credit in connection with the remittance transfer, then § 1005.33(f)(2) provides that § 1026.13 applies to the creditor while § 1005.33 applies to the remittance transfer provider, but only with respect to the amount of the remittance transfer funded by the credit card. However, if the remittance transfer provider is also the creditor, only § 1026.13 applies to the remittance transfer provider with respect to the amount of the remittance transfer funded by the credit card.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Similarly, if the error asserted is an incorrect EFT from a sender's account, then § 1005.33(f)(1) provides that § 1005.11 applies to the account-holding institution while § 1005.33 applies to the remittance transfer provider, but only with respect to the amount of the remittance transfer funded by the debit card or the ACH transfer from the sender's account. However, if the remittance transfer provider is also the account-holding institution, only § 1005.33 applies to the remittance transfer provider with respect to the amount of the remittance transfer funded by the debit card or the ACH transfer from the sender's account. The Bureau believes the regulation and commentary as adopted provide sufficient guidance in this regard, and additional clarification is not necessary.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>33(e) Reassertion of Error</title>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, under proposed § 205.33(e), a remittance transfer provider that has fully complied with the error resolution requirements with respect to a particular notice of error would have no further responsibilities in the event the sender later reasserts the same error, except in the case of an error asserted following the sender's receipt of information provided under § 1005.33(a)(1)(v). Furthermore, proposed comment 33(e)-1 explained that the remittance transfer provider would have no further error resolution responsibilities if the sender voluntarily withdraws the notice alleging an error. In such case, however, the sender would retain the right to reassert the allegation within the original 180-day period from the disclosed date of availability unless the remittance transfer provider had already complied with all of the error resolution requirements before the allegation was withdrawn. As noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the proposed provision and comment were modeled on similar provisions under § 1005.11(e). The Board requested comment on whether additional guidance is necessary regarding the circumstances in which a sender has “voluntarily withdrawn” a notice of error.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Commenters did not generally address proposed § 205.33(e) or proposed comment 33(e)-1. However, one industry commenter suggested that the error resolution process under proposed § 205.33 should be the exclusive remedy for the enumerated errors. EFTA section 916 provides that there is no civil liability for an error resolved in accordance with the error resolution procedures set forth in EFTA section 908, which are the error resolution procedures implemented in § 1005.11. The Bureau notes that EFTA section 916 was not amended to include the error resolution procedures for remittance transfers set forth in EFTA section 919(d). As such, under EFTA section 916, a court could find that there is civil liability even for an error that has been resolved in accordance with the error resolution procedures in § 1005.33. Accordingly, the Bureau adopts proposed § 205.33(e) as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(e) . The Bureau adopts comment 33(e)-1 with one change to include the time period relevant to an error asserted pursuant to § 1005.33(b)(2) after a sender receives requested documentation, additional information or clarification from the remittance transfer provider.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>33(d) Procedures if Remittance Transfer Provider Determines No Error or Different Error Occurred</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed § 205.33(d) to establish procedures in the event that a remittance transfer provider determines that no error or a different error occurred from that described by the sender. Specifically, proposed § 205.33(d)(1) stated that the remittance transfer provider must provide a written explanation of the provider's finding that there was no error or that a different error occurred, consistent with EFTA section 919(d)(1)(B)(iv). Such explanation would have to respond to the sender's specific complaint and note the sender's right to request the documents that the provider relied on in making its determination. Furthermore, under proposed § 205.33(d)(2), the remittance transfer provider would be required to promptly provide copies of such documentation upon the sender's request.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Under proposed comment 33(d)-1, if a remittance transfer provider determined that an error occurred in a manner or amount different from that described by the sender, the provider would be required to comply with applicable provisions of both § 1005.33(c) and (d) (proposed as § 205.33(c) and (d)). Similar to comment 11(d)-1 with respect to error investigations involving EFTs, the provider may choose to give the notice of correction of error under § 1005.33(c)(1) (proposed as § 205.33(c)(1)) and the explanation that a different error occurred under § 1005.33(d) (proposed as § 205.33(d)) separately or in a combined form. The Bureau did not receive any comments on the procedures set forth in proposed § 205.33(d) or comment 33(d)-1. The Bureau adopts these provisions substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(d) and comment 33(d)-1.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>30(a) Agent</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.30(a) stated that an “agent” means an agent, authorized delegate, or person affiliated with a remittance transfer provider under State or other applicable law, when such agent, authorized delegate, or affiliate acts for that remittance transfer provider. The final rule adopts the definition as proposed in renumbered § 1005.30(a).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919 does not use consistent terminology concerning agents of remittance transfer providers. For example, EFTA section 919(f)(1) uses the phrase “agent, authorized delegate, or person affiliated with a remittance transfer provider,” when that person “acts for that remittance transfer provider,” while other provisions use the phrase “agent or authorized delegate” (EFTA section 919(f)(2)) or simply “agent” (EFTA section 919(b)). The Bureau does not believe that these statutory wording differences are intended to establish different standards across the rule. Therefore, the rule generally refers to “agents,” as defined in § 1005.30(a), to provide consistency across the rule.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Commenters suggested that the Bureau provide further clarity on the definition of “agent,” including clarifying that financial institutions' relationships with intermediary and correspondent institutions are not agency relationships unless an agreement creates such a relationship as a matter of law. The final rule does not contain these suggested clarifications. The Bureau believes that because the concept of agency has historically been defined by common law, it is appropriate for the definition to defer to applicable law regarding agents, including with respect to what creates or constitutes an agency relationship.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>30(b) Business Day</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Several provisions in the final rule use the term “business day.” <em data-original="E-03">See, e.g.,</em> §§ 1005.31(e)(2) and 1005.33(c)(1). Because the definition of “business day” in § 1005.2(d) of Regulation E applies only to financial institutions and includes inapt commentary, the Board proposed an alternative definition of “business day” applicable to remittance transfer providers. The proposed rule stated that “business day” means any day on which a remittance transfer provider accepts funds for sending remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Commenters generally objected to the proposed definition. In particular, financial institution commenters expressed concern that the date on which an institution “accepts funds” is unclear, because it could be interpreted either as the date on which funds are deposited into an account, or when the institution accepts a sender's order to transfer funds. Other commenters suggested replacing the proposed definition with a definition closer to the definition of “business day” in § 1005.2(d) Regulation E. Upon further review, and for greater consistency among definitions, the Bureau is adopting a revised “business day” definition in renumbered § 1005.30(b) as explained in related commentary that more closely tracks the general definition of “business day” in § 1005.2(d), but that is tailored to the particular aspects of remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Specifically, § 1005.30(b) states that “business day” means any day on which the offices of a remittance transfer provider are open to the public for carrying on substantially all business functions. Similar to proposed comment 30(b)-1, final comment 30(b)-1 clarifies that with respect to subpart B, a business day includes the entire 24-hour period ending at midnight, and a notice given under any section of subpart B is effective even if given outside of normal business hours. However, comment 30(b)-1 states that a remittance transfer provider is not required under subpart B to make telephone lines available on a 24-hour basis.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Comment 30(b)-2 explains that “substantially all business functions” include both the public and the back-office operations of the provider. For example, if the offices of a provider are open on Saturdays for customers to request remittance transfers, but not for performing internal functions (such as investigating errors), then Saturday is not a business day for that provider. In this case, Saturday does not count toward the business-day standard for subpart B for purposes of determining the number of days for resolving errors, processing refunds, etc.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Comment 30(b)-3 clarifies that a provider may determine, at its election, whether an abbreviated day is a business day. For example, if a provider engages in substantially all business functions until noon on Saturdays instead of its usual 3 p.m. closing, it may consider Saturday a business day. Finally, comment 30(b)-4 states that if a provider makes a telephone line available on Sundays for cancelling the transfer, but performs no other business functions, Sunday is not a business day under the “substantially all business functions” standard.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>30(c) Designated Recipient</title>
      <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(g)(1) provides that “designated recipient” means “any person located in a foreign country and identified by the sender as the authorized recipient of a remittance transfer to be made by a remittance transfer provider, except that a designated recipient shall not be deemed to be a consumer for purposes of [the EFTA].” Proposed § 205.30(c) implemented EFTA section 919(g)(1), with several edits for clarity. First, the Board proposal noted that a remittance transfer provider will generally only know the location where funds are to be sent, rather than where a designated recipient is physically located. For instance, although the sender may indicate that funds are to be sent to the recipient in Mexico City, the recipient could actually be in the United States at the time of the transfer. Thus, the Board stated that the statutory reference to a “person located in a foreign country” should be read with a view to the location where funds are to be sent. Additionally, the statute references a remittance transfer “to be made by a remittance transfer provider.” As discussed below, the definition of “remittance transfer” requires that it be sent by a remittance transfer provider, so this language is unnecessary. Accordingly, proposed § 205.30(c) stated that a designated recipient is any person specified by the sender as an authorized recipient of a remittance transfer to be received at a location in a foreign country. The final rule adopts the proposed rule as proposed in renumbered § 1005.30(c), but with additional explanatory commentary to address issues raised by commenters.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 30(c)-1 stated that a designated recipient can be either a natural person or a business. Several commenters argued that transfers to entities other than natural persons should be excluded, so that the rule would cover only consumer-to-consumer transfers. However, the statute clearly anticipates covering consumer-to-business transfers, as it defines “designated recipient” to include transfers to “persons,” and does not limit its application to consumer recipients. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 15 U.S.C. 1693p(g)(1). The EFTA defines “consumer” to mean a natural person, but does not define the term “person.” Nonetheless, the EFTA uses the term “person” in many provisions, and the context of how the term “person” is used in those EFTA provisions indicates that it includes entities that are natural persons, as well as organizations. For example, the EFTA defines the term “financial institution” to mean “a State or National bank, a State or Federal savings and loan association, a mutual savings bank, a State or Federal credit union, or any <em data-original="E-03">other</em> person who, directly or indirectly, holds an account belonging to a consumer.” (emphasis added). As a result, Regulation E has long defined “person” to mean a natural person or an organization. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.2(j). The Bureau believes that the statute by using the term “person” intended to cover remittance transfers sent by consumers not just to family members, but also directly to businesses abroad to pay tuition, mortgage, medical, utilities, or other bills or to fulfill other obligations. Accordingly, the final rule does not generally exclude consumer-to-business transfers where a remittance transfer provider is acting as an electronic intermediary. Instead, the Bureau is adopting comment 30(c)-1 to state that a designated recipient can be either a natural person or an organization, such as a corporation.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 30(c)-2 explained that a remittance transfer is received at a location in a foreign country if funds are to be received at a location physically outside of any State.<footnote ref="67">The term “State” is defined in 12 CFR 1005.2(l).</footnote>
             One money transmitter commenter noted that it may know the country to which a transfer is being sent, but not the specific payout location. The comment was intended to address the receipt of funds at a foreign location in the general sense; that is, any location that is outside of a State. Thus, the final comment, adopted as renumbered comment 30(c)-2.i., clarifies that a sender need not designate a specific pick-up location.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In addition, commenters requested further clarification for determining whether there is a designated recipient when a transfer is made to an account. For example, in a wire transfer transaction, commenters stated that the consumer requesting the transfer may only identify the recipient of funds by an account number or the location or routing number of the receiving institution. Other commenters argued that transfers to an account associated with an institution in a State should not be viewed as transfers to a designated recipient, even if a person in a foreign country has exclusive access to the account.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 30(c)-2.ii. provides further guidance to address these issues. For transfers to a designated recipient's account, comment 30(c)-2.ii. states that whether funds are to be received at a location physically outside of any State depends on where the account is located. If the account is located in a State, the funds will not be received at a location in a foreign country.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau concurs with the Board's statement that the statutory reference to a “person located in a foreign country” should be read with a view to the location where funds are to be sent, and believes that comment 30(c)-2.ii. is consistent with this approach. Thus, the Bureau agrees that transfers to domestic accounts should not be considered transfers to a location in a foreign country. The Bureau also agrees that providers may not always know where a recipient is physically located at the time a consumer requests a transfer to be sent, and believes that directing providers to look to the location of the account, rather than the location of the individual recipient, creates an appropriate bright line that will facilitate compliance with the final rule, ease compliance burden, and most effectively accomplish the purpose of the statute to apply the provisions to transfers to foreign countries.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One commenter suggested revising the definition of “designated recipient” to exclude senders, such that transfers made by a sender to a sender's separate account abroad would be excluded. However, nothing in the statute indicates that the definition of “designated recipient” should exclude transfers to a foreign-based account of the sender. The Bureau believes that a sender would also benefit from disclosures indicating the ultimate amount to be received in a transfer, particularly where an exchange rate is applied. The final rule adopts comment 30(c)-3 to clarify that a sender may also be a designated recipient, such as where a sender requests that a provider send an electronic transfer of funds from the sender's checking account in a State to the sender's checking account located in a foreign country.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Board solicited comment on whether there could be instances where a remittance provider may receive a recipient's email address but no other information to determine the location where funds are to be received. Several commenters affirmed this could happen. For example, one commenter stated that consumers can provide a recipient's email address to use its transfer service; while recipients must register with the provider to access the transferred funds, it is possible that the provider would not know whether the transferred funds will be received at a location in a foreign country until the funds are claimed.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Final comment 30(c)-2.iii. addresses this scenario. Where the sender does not specify information about a recipient's account, but instead just provides information about the recipient, a remittance transfer provider must determine whether the funds will be received at a location in a foreign country based on information that is provided by the sender, and other information the provider may have, at the time the transfer is requested. For example, if a consumer gives a provider the recipient's email address, and the provider has no other information about whether the funds will be received by the recipient at a location in a foreign country, then the provider may determine that funds are not to be received at a location in a foreign country. However, if the provider has additional information at the time the transfer is requested indicating that funds are to be received in a foreign country, such as where the recipient's email address is registered with the provider and associated with a foreign account, then the provider has sufficient information to conclude that the remittance transfer is to be received at a location in a foreign country.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Commenters also noted that, with regard to prepaid cards, the provider may not know at the time the prepaid card is purchased whether the funds will be received at a location physically outside of any State. These commenters stated that where general-purpose reloadable prepaid cards or payroll cards are issued to two persons—one person in a State and another person in a foreign country—and both cards access the same funds, the provider may not be able to ascertain at the time of the request for the cards that funds will be received at a location physically outside of any State. In this case, the issuer does not know at the time of the request the ultimate recipient of the funds.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that funds that can be accessed by a prepaid card are generally not considered to be an “account” as defined in § 1005.2(b) of Regulation E. Thus, where the funds that can be accessed by a prepaid card are held does not determine whether a prepaid card is being issued to a designated recipient. The Bureau believes when a participant in a prepaid card program, such as a prepaid card issuer or a prepaid card program manager, issues prepaid cards, the participant in the prepaid card program must look to where it or another participant in the prepaid card program sends the prepaid cards, to determine whether the prepaid card funds will be received in a foreign country. Likewise, when a participant in a prepaid card program adds additional funds at the sender's direct request to prepaid cards that it or any other participant previously issued, the participant in the prepaid card program must look to where it or another participant in the prepaid card program has sent the cards to determine whether the prepaid card funds will be received in a foreign country. The Bureau does not believe that it is appropriate for a participant in the prepaid card program to determine whether the funds will be received in a foreign country based on where the participants have decided to hold the funds the cards access. The Bureau believes that such a rule would allow participants in the prepaid card program to circumvent the remittance transfer rules by holding the funds in a State. Under such an approach, participants in the prepaid card program would not be required to comply with the remittance transfer rules if the funds are located in a State even where prepaid cards that access the funds are sent only to recipients located in a foreign country.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In the case where two prepaid cards are issued to two persons—one person in a State and another person in a foreign country—and both cards access the same funds, the Bureau believes that the provider has sufficient information to determine that the funds will be received in a foreign country because it has sent one of the prepaid cards to a person in a foreign country. Proposed comment 30(d)-3 suggested that in this situation, the transfer would not be to a designated recipient because the sender retained the ability to draw down the funds on the prepaid card. Proposed comment 30(d)-3 is not adopted. The Bureau is concerned that if it adopted a rule that the transfer is not to a designated recipient in this case, a provider that sends prepaid cards abroad with the intent of providing a service where funds loaded in a State are intended to be accessed in a foreign country could circumvent the remittance transfer rules by always automatically providing a second prepaid card to the sender, even if the sender did not request a second card.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Thus, final comment 30(c)-2.iii. clarifies that if a consumer in a State purchases a prepaid card, the provider has sufficient information to conclude that the funds are to be received in a foreign country if the remittance transfer provider sends a prepaid card to a specified recipient in a foreign country, even if a person located in a State, including the sender, retains the ability to access funds on the prepaid card. In this case, the prepaid issuer knows at the time of the request that a prepaid card has been sent to a recipient located in a foreign country. In contrast, if the provider provides the card directly to the consumer, the provider may conclude that funds are not to be received in a foreign country, because the provider does not know whether the consumer will subsequently send the prepaid card to a recipient in a foreign country.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>30(c) Designated Recipient</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Under the 2012 Final Rule, the term “designated recipient” is defined to mean any person specified by the sender as the authorized recipient of a remittance transfer to be received at a location in a foreign country.  Section 1005.30(c).  Comment 30(c)-1 further clarifies that a designated recipient can be either a natural person or an organization, such as a corporation. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.2(j) (definition of person).  Relatedly, § 1005.31(b)(2)(iii) requires a remittance transfer provider to disclose to a sender the name of the designated recipient.  Thus, the provider must ascertain this name from the sender at or before the receipt or combined disclosure is provided to the sender. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed below in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv), the Bureau is adopting certain revisions to 2012 Final Rule's error resolution provisions in § 1005.33 where a transfer is delivered to someone other than the designated recipient.  In particular, § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) creates a new exception to the definition of error in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) that applies when a sender provides an incorrect account number or recipient institution identifier, and the conditions in § 1005.33(h) are met.  Based on comments received regarding these proposed changes, and, in particular, concerning the specific mistakes by a sender that might result in an error under the 2012 Final Rule, the Bureau believes that it would be useful to provide further clarity on how the designated recipient is determined for purposes of determining whether an error has occurred or the new exception under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) applies.  In particular, the Bureau believes it necessary to address situations in which the transfer is delivered to someone other than the designated recipient named by the sender at the time of the transfer.  Therefore, the Bureau is clarifying in comment 30(c)-1 that the designated recipient is identified by the name of the person stated on the disclosure provided pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(iii).</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Application of the Remittance Rule to U.S. Military Installations Abroad</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As noted in the April Proposal, the Remittance Rule applies when a sender located in a “State” sends funds to a designated recipient at a location in a “foreign country.” <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.30(c) and (g). Further, the Rule specifies that in the context of transfers to or from an account, the Rule's application depends on the location of the account rather than the account owner's physical location at the time of transfer. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comments 30(c)-2.ii and 30(g). The Rule does not, however, specifically address the status of a transfer that is sent to or from a U.S. military installation located in a foreign country, nor does the definition of “State” in subpart A of Regulation E (§ 1005.2(l)) directly address the definition's application to a U.S. military installation.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In the April Proposal, the Bureau recognized that the Remittance Rule's application to transfers sent to and from U.S. military installations located abroad could, in some cases, lead to confusion. Specifically, the Bureau had received inquiries about whether U.S. military installations located abroad should be treated as located in a State or in a foreign country. The Bureau noted that application of the Remittance Rule might also differ depending on whether the transfer was sent to or from a depository institution account or would be picked up by the recipient at a location on the military installation. For example, there could be confusion as to whether the Remittance Rule applies when a consumer in the United States sends a cash transfer to be picked up by a recipient at a financial institution (not into the recipient's account) on a U.S. military base in a foreign country. Depending on whether the financial institution is deemed to be at a location in a “foreign country” or a “State,” the Remittance Rule may or may not apply. There might also be confusion about whether a cash transfer from a consumer on a foreign military installation to a recipient in the surrounding country would be subject to the rule, again depending on whether the foreign military installation is deemed to be in a “State.”</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau noted in the April Proposal, however, that the application of the Remittance Rule could be different for transfers from accounts of persons located on U.S. military installations abroad. When a transfer is made from such an account, whether the sender is located in a State is determined by the location of the sender's account rather than the physical location of the sender at the time of the transaction. Similarly, whether or not the Remittance Rule applies to transfers from the United States to accounts of different persons stationed at U.S. military installations abroad could differ, depending on the locations of those recipients' accounts. Thus, there may also be confusion as to whether the Remittance Rule applies when a transfer is sent from an account in the United States to an account located at a U.S. military installation abroad, to the extent such accounts exist.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In light of the complexity of these issues, the Bureau sought comment on whether it would be advisable to provide further clarity on this point and also sought data regarding these issues. The Bureau acknowledged in the April Proposal that it did not then have sufficient information or data to make a determination regarding whether the Remittance Rule should (or should not) treat foreign military installations as “States” for purposes of the Remittance Rule, both in the context of transfers received in cash and in the context of transfers sent to or from an account that is located on a military installation. Accordingly, the Bureau sought data on the relative number of transfers sent to and from individuals and/or accounts located on U.S. military installations in foreign countries. In addition, the Bureau sought comment on the appropriateness of extending any clarification regarding U.S. military installations to other U.S. government installations abroad, such as U.S. diplomatic missions.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received several comments on this issue. While a small number of commenters reported on the number of transfers they send to overseas military installations, commenters did not provide data on the relative number of transfers sent to and from such installations. The vast majority of commenters, however, recommended that the Bureau treat U.S. military installations abroad as located “on U.S. soil,” and therefore exempt transfers sent to such installations from the Remittance Rule. Commenters favoring this approach provided various rationales. Several commenters, including a large bank, a community bank, and a State trade association, recommended exempting remittance transfers to U.S. military installations abroad from the Rule. They stated that such transfers present lower risks to consumers than remittance transfers sent from the United States to other foreign locations, because transfers involving U.S. military installations are generally sent to and from U.S. financial institutions, in U.S. dollars, using U.S. payment systems (thus subject to the rules of those systems). They further argued that such transfers do not involve fluctuating exchange rates, and will likely be subject to U.S. consumer protection laws (insofar as the recipient institution is a U.S. financial institution).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Other commenters, including community banks, large banks, credit unions, and trade associations, noted that other statutory and regulatory regimes currently treat U.S. military installations located abroad as located in the United States. For example, a large bank noted that deposits in foreign branches of U.S. financial institutions that are located on a U.S. military installation and governed by Department of Defense regulations are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, while deposits in foreign branches that are not located on such installations are not. A national trade association and a federal credit union similarly noted that the U.S. Postal Service treats mail sent from the United States to U.S. military installations overseas as domestic mail. Several other commenters, including a number of credit unions, urged the Bureau to exempt transfers to U.S. military installations abroad because, they claimed, many remittance transfer providers were already treating such installations as located on “U.S. soil.”</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A few commenters did not support treating U.S. military installations as “States” for purposes of the Remittance Rule. One consumer group argued that the Bureau should treat military installations abroad as located in a foreign country because individuals who send remittance transfers to family members stationed abroad should receive the protections of the Remittance Rule. Other commenters, including a group of national trade associations, noted that any solution that applied exclusively to military installations would pose logistical challenges, because it may be difficult to determine whether a recipient or a recipient's account is located on a military installation. These commenters were either silent about how the Bureau should resolve the issue of money transfers to U.S. military installations or advocated that the Bureau maintain the status quo.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Based on its review of the comments received and its own analysis of this issue, the Bureau is persuaded, for the reasons discussed below, that transfers to individuals and accounts located on U.S. military installations located abroad, as well as transfers from individuals and their accounts located on U.S. military installations abroad to designated recipients in the United States, should be excluded from the Remittance Rule's application. Accordingly, the Bureau is finalizing revisions to the commentary to the definitions of “designated recipient” (§ 1005.30(c)) and “sender” (§ 1005.30(g)). These revisions clarify that, for purposes of determining whether a transfer qualifies as a “remittance transfer” under the Rule, persons or accounts that are located on a U.S. military installation abroad are considered to be located in a State. Pursuant to these revisions, revised comment 30(c)-2.i explains that funds that will be received at a location on a U.S. military installation that is physically located abroad are received in a State, and revised comment 30(c)-2.ii explains that, for transfers that are sent to a recipient's account, an account that is located on a U.S. military installation abroad is considered to be located in a State. As revised, comment 30(g)-1 now explains that senders or senders' accounts that are located on U.S. military installations that are physically located abroad are located in a State for purposes of subpart B.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes this approach provides clarity without undermining the important consumer protections provided by the Remittance Rule. The Bureau agrees with the majority of commenters that transfers from the United States to a U.S. military installation located abroad share many of the characteristics of domestic transfers, and as such harbor less risk for consumers than a typical remittance transfer. In sum, while the Bureau agrees that servicemembers and their families deserve to receive the same consumer protections that are available to all other consumers, the Bureau agrees with those commenters who asserted that the consumer protection concerns associated with transfers sent to locations in a foreign country generally do not apply to transfers sent to U.S. military installations abroad. Meanwhile, the Bureau notes that transfers from locations on U.S. military installations abroad to recipients in foreign countries may, in many circumstances, qualify as remittance transfers. Unlike the quasi-domestic nature of transfers to the U.S. military installations abroad, transfers from those installations to foreign countries are typically sent without the protection of laws and rules in place for domestic transfers and are more likely to be involve a foreign currency exchange. The Bureau will continue to monitor, through its complaint intake processes and other channels, whether particular concerns arise with respect to transfers involving U.S. military installations abroad.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau declines to adopt the bright-line test proposed by one money transmitter commenter that would have allowed remittance transfer providers to determine an account's location by looking at whether the account was held with a United States or a foreign financial institution. The Bureau believes that such a rule would be over-broad in that it would exclude transfers that are sent to accounts located in foreign branches of U.S. financial institutions, of which the Bureau believes there are many. Such transfers, with the limited exception of transfers to foreign branches located on U.S. military installations abroad, as discussed above, currently qualify as remittance transfers under the Rule, and the Bureau did not intend to change this result when it proposed to clarify the treatment of U.S. military installations.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau acknowledges that, as noted by a few commenters, there may be some scenarios in which it is impossible for the remittance transfer provider to know that the transfer will be sent to a location or account located on a U.S. military installation. The Bureau notes, however, that such scenarios already exist regardless of whether the transfer involves a U.S. military installation located abroad; indeed, the Bureau has previously addressed these scenarios in existing comment 30(c)-2.iii, which explains that, where a sender does not specify information about a designated recipient's account, a provider may make the determination of whether funds will received in a foreign country based on “other information.” Thus, those providers who currently make a determination about the location of a recipient or a recipient's account by, for example, looking at the routing number and address of the branch of the financial institution receiving the transfer, can continue to do so; the revised commentary merely provides that where they have specific information that the account is located on a U.S. military installation, they can treat the account as located in a State, notwithstanding any information to the contrary derived from the account's routing number.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau is not finalizing a provision that would address the application of the Remittance Rule to other U.S. government installations abroad. The Bureau did not receive any comments indicating that there is actual or potential confusion with respect to the Remittance Rule's application to non-military U.S. installations located in foreign countries.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Non-Consumer Accounts</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.30(g) provides that a “sender” under subpart B of Regulation E means a consumer in a State who primarily for personal, family, or household purposes requests a remittance transfer provider to send a remittance transfer to a designated recipient. Together with the definition of “remittance transfer” in § 1005.30(e), this means that for the Remittance Rule to apply to an electronic transfer of funds, the transfer must have been requested by a consumer primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In response to certain questions about how to determine whether the Remittance Rule applies to transfers sent from an account that is not an account for the purposes of Regulation E, such as a business account, the Bureau proposed to add comment 30(g)-2 to explain that a consumer is a “sender” only if the consumer requests a transfer primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. The proposed comment would have also explained that for transfers from an account, the primary purpose for which the account was established determines whether a transfer from that account is requested for personal, family, or household purposes. Accordingly, under the proposed clarification, a transfer is not requested primarily for personal, family, or household purposes if it is sent from an account that was not established primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, such as an account that was established as a business or commercial account or an account held by a business entity such as a corporation, not-for-profit corporation, professional corporation, limited liability company, partnership, or sole proprietorship, and a person requesting a transfer from such an account therefore is not a sender under § 1005.30(g). Having reviewed the comments received and for the reasons set forth below, the Bureau is adopting comment 30(g)-2 with the modifications explained below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One of the two consumer group commenters supported this aspect of the April Proposal. Industry commenters generally supported clarifying that the Remittance Rule does not apply to transfers sent from business accounts. Several trade association commenters also supported the change but noted that some financial institutions may re-code accounts that were initially set up as consumer accounts as business accounts, based on the way an accountholder uses the account. The trade association commenters asserted that the Bureau should clarify that financial institutions could rely on the way the account is identified in their records at the time the transfer is requested to determine whether the transfer is made for personal, family, or household purposes. One large money transmitter commenter expressed concern about proposed comment 30(g)-2, because it interpreted the proposed comment to mean that a remittance transfer provider must apply the Remittance Rule to any transfer from a consumer account, even if the customer indicates that the transfer is for a business purpose. The commenter asserted that this interpretation would result in compliance burden for some money transmitters. It explained that it offers customers the ability to send transfers from accounts, but because it does not hold the accounts, it does not know whether those accounts are consumer or non-consumer accounts. Therefore, it relies on the purpose of a transfer, as indicated by its customer, to determine if the transfer is a remittance transfer for purposes of the Rule. A large bank commenter requested that the Bureau adopt additional commentary to clarify that the Remittance Rule does not apply to transfers from accounts held by a financial institution under a <em data-original="E-03">bona fide</em> trust agreement because those accounts do not meet the definition of “account” under the general provisions of Regulation E.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has considered the comments and, for reasons discussed in more detail below, is adopting as proposed the aspect of proposed comment 30(g)-2 that would have explained the definition of a “sender.” The Bureau is also adding new comment 30(g)-3, in which it is adopting the aspect of proposed comment 30(g)-2 that would have explained that a transfer sent from a non-consumer account is not requested primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, and therefore a consumer requesting a transfer from such an account is not a sender under § 1005.30(g).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Additionally, the Bureau is explaining in comment 30(g)-3 that a transfer from an account held by a financial institution under a <em data-original="E-03">bona fide</em> trust agreement is also not requested for personal, family, or household purposes, and therefore a consumer requesting a transfer from such an account is not a sender under § 1005.30(g). Section 1005.2(b)(3) provides that the term “account” in Regulation E does not include an account held by a financial institution under a <em data-original="E-03">bona fide</em> trust agreement. The Bureau believes that adding this clarification to comment 30(g)-3 is consistent with the Bureau's intent to clarify that insofar as a transfer is sent from an account, the Remittance Rule only applies to transfers from accounts that fall within the definition of “account” under the general provisions of Regulation E.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is not adopting the aspect of the proposed comment 30(g)-2 that would have explained that the primary purpose for which the account was established determines whether a transfer from that account is for personal, family, or household purposes. Upon further consideration, the Bureau believes that this aspect of the proposed comment could have been interpreted to mean that a provider would have to apply the Remittance Rule to all transfers from a consumer account, even in situations in which the sender indicates that the primary purpose of the transfer is a non-consumer purpose. Although the Bureau continues to believes that a provider should be able to rely on the primary purpose for which the account was established to determine whether a transfer from that account is for personal, family, or household purposes, the Bureau believes that applying the Rule to all transfers from a consumer account, even in situations in which the sender indicates that the primary purpose of the transfer is a non-consumer purpose, would be in tension with the definition of a “sender.” The Bureau is also concerned that such a bright-line test could cause compliance burden, as suggested above by a large money transmitter, if required in all cases. The Bureau further believes that it is appropriate to draw a clear line with respect to the applicability of the Remittance Rule to transfers sent from accounts that were not established primarily for personal, family, or household purposes for providers who have access to that information.
        </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, as adopted, comment 30(g)-2 explains that a consumer is a “sender” only where he or she requests a transfer primarily for personal, family, or household purposes and that a consumer who requests a transfer primarily for other purposes, such as business or commercial purposes, is not a sender under § 1005.30(g). It further explains that if a consumer requests a transfer from an account that was established primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, then a remittance transfer provider may generally deem that the transfer is requested primarily for personal, family, or household purposes and the consumer is therefore a “sender” under § 1005.30(g). However, if the consumer indicates that he or she is requesting the transfer primarily for other purposes, such as business or commercial purposes, then the provider may deem the consumer not to be a sender under § 1005.30(g), even if the consumer is requesting the transfer from an account that is used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 30(g)-3 explains that a provider may deem that a transfer that is requested to be sent from an account that was not established primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, such as an account that was established as a business or commercial account or an account held by a business entity such as a corporation, not-for-profit corporation, professional corporation, limited liability company, partnership, or sole proprietorship, as not being requested primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. A consumer requesting a transfer be sent from such an account therefore is not a sender under § 1005.30(g). The comment also explains that a transfer that is sent from an account held by a financial institution under a <em data-original="E-03">bona fide</em> trust agreement pursuant to § 1005.2(b)(3) is not requested primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, and a consumer requesting a transfer from such an account therefore is not a sender under § 1005.30(g).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Lastly, as discussed above, several trade association commenters suggested that the Bureau adopt guidance that would permit a financial institution to rely on the way an account is identified in its records at the time the transfer is requested (rather than when the account was established) to determine whether the transfer is made primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. The Bureau is not adopting this recommendation. The Bureau proposed comment 30(g)-2 to provide additional clarification that transfers from accounts that do not meet the definition of “account” under the general provisions of Regulation E are not subject to the Remittance Rule. Pursuant to § 1005.2(b)(1), an account at a financial institution is an “account” for purposes of Regulation E if it was “ <em data-original="E-03">established</em> primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.” (Emphasis added.) In other words, the primary purpose for which an account was established determines whether the account is an “account” for purposes of Regulation E. Accordingly, the Bureau believes that adopting this suggestion would be inconsistent with § 1005.2(b)(1), which is a long-standing part of Regulation E. Insofar as commenters did not suggest why accounts should be treated differently for purposes of subpart B of Regulation E, the Bureau is not adopting this suggestion.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b) above, the Bureau proposed to require the same short form and long form disclosures for payroll card accounts (and government benefit accounts) as for prepaid accounts generally. However, as discussed in detail below, the Bureau also proposed in § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(A) to require that the short form disclosure for payroll card accounts include a statement at the top of the short form indicating that a consumer does not have to accept the payroll card account and instructing the consumer to ask the employer about other ways to receive his or her wages instead of receiving them via the payroll card account, in a form substantially similar to proposed Model Form A-10(b). Proposed § 1005.15(c)(2) would have included a similar requirement for government benefit accounts, reflected in proposed Model Form A-10(a).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to the existing compulsory use prohibition in § 1005.10(e)(2), no financial institution or other person may require a consumer to establish an account for receipt of EFTs with a particular institution as a condition of employment or receipt of a government benefit. <em data-original="E-03">See also</em> existing comment 10(e)(2)-1 and final comment 10(e)(2)-2. The Bureau believed it is important for consumers to realize they have the option of not receiving payment of wages via a payroll card account, and that receiving such notice at the top of the short form disclosure will help to ensure consumers are aware of this right. For this reason, the Bureau proposed that a notice be provided at the top of the short form for a payroll card account to highlight for consumers that they are not required to accept a particular payroll card account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Specifically, proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(A) would have required that, when offering a payroll card account, a financial institution must include a statement on the short form disclosure that a consumer does not have to accept the payroll card account, and that a consumer can ask about other ways to get wages or salary from the employer instead of receiving them via the payroll card account, in a form substantially similar to the language set forth in Model Form A-10(b). Proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(A) would have also cross-referenced proposed § 1005.15(c)(2) for requirements regarding what notice to give a consumer when offering a government benefit account.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters, including industry trade associations (including several that focus on payroll and employment issues), issuing banks, program managers, payment networks, as well as several employers, several State government agencies, and a think tank commented on this aspect of the proposal. Specifically, they expressed concern that the proposed compulsory use statement was negative and implies that the payroll or government benefit card is an inferior product, thereby discouraging its use. One commenter said the negative statement would, in effect, “warn away” consumers from choosing a payroll card account or government benefit card. A number of industry commenters suggested alternative disclosure language that they said would render more neutral the statement proposed by the Bureau.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters also asserted out that many States allow employee wages paid only via electronic means; because there is no paper check option for receiving wages, the commenters concluded that unless the employee has a bank account that can receive direct deposits, the payroll card account would be the sole way to receive wages. Others noted that most State wage and hour laws already require disclosure of information about all wage payment options before an employee decides how to receive wages. One trade association stated that the Bureau should not require financial institutions to list all available wage payment options as part of the banner notice in the final rule, as it would be difficult for employers operating in multiple states who would need to have different forms for different states, but also stated that it would support such a disclosure if it were available as an alternative to the version the Bureau proposed.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Relatedly, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b) above, some industry commenters generally objected to the proposed short form disclosure requirement for payroll card accounts (and government benefit accounts) citing, among other things, State-required disclosure of certain fee discounts and waivers as a factor distinguishing these accounts from GPR cards. Other industry commenters recommended that the Bureau permit additional disclosures on the short form for these products, such as disclosure of State-required methods to access wages without incurring fees.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Conversely, a number of consumer group commenters supported the proposed disclosure requirements for payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts generally. Their comments underscored the importance of the notice regarding payment options at the top of the short form disclosure, with some recommending an even more conspicuous disclosure, or an expanded disclosure explaining the benefit of direct deposit to a bank account as generally cheaper and more advantageous to the consumer than receiving funds via a payroll card account (or government benefit account). Some consumer groups recommended that the Bureau extend the banner notice requirement to other types of prepaid accounts that are not subject to Regulation E's compulsory use prohibition, such as those used to disburse students' financial aid, insurance proceeds, tax refunds, and needs-tested government benefits that are excluded from coverage under Regulation E generally. Some consumer groups also urged disclosure of additional information, such as alerting the consumer when payments stop (for example when the consumer leaves the job or no longer qualifies for benefits), instructing the consumer how to un-enroll from the prepaid program, and explicitly stating that the employer cannot require acceptance of the payroll card account as a condition of employment and cannot retaliate against an employee that does not accept a payroll card account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A nonprofit organization representing the interests of restaurant workers submitted information gathered from a survey it conducted of 200 people employed by a company that compensates nearly half of its 140,000 hourly employees via payroll card. Survey results showed that, among other problems, 63 percent of employees surveyed reported that they were not told about all of the fees associated with the payroll card before it was issued to them and 26 percent reported not being allowed to choose an alternative method of payment.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(2)(iii) above, the office of a State Attorney General recommended free and unlimited withdrawal of wages via ATMs, stating that its research in its State revealed that ATMs were the most common way for payroll card accountholders to access their wages and that accountholders regularly incurred fees for ATM transactions.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth in the proposal and herein, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(A), renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(A), with certain modifications. First, the Bureau has modified the proposed regulatory text to permit financial institutions to choose between two statements regarding wage payment options for payroll cards. Second, the Bureau has added, in new § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B), a provision to the final rule permitting financial institutions to include in the short form disclosure for payroll card accounts a statement directing consumers to a particular location outside the short form disclosure for information on ways the consumer may access payroll card account funds and balance information for free or for a reduced fee. In addition, for the reasons set forth below, the Bureau is adopting four new comments to further explain and clarify the requirements in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(A) and (B). Finally, the Bureau has made technical modifications to the rule for conformity and clarity.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting this provision pursuant to its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c), and 913(2), and section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, as discussed above. EFTA section 913(2) prohibits a person from requiring a consumer to establish an account for receipt of EFTs with a particular financial institution as a condition of employment or receipt of a government benefit. The Bureau believes it is important for consumers to realize they have the option of not receiving payment of wages or government benefits via a payroll card account or government benefit account, and that receiving such notice at the top of the short form disclosure will help to ensure consumers are aware of this right and can thus exercise their right. Further, the Bureau believes that requiring this disclosure is necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account users because the revision will assist consumers' understanding of the terms and conditions of their prepaid accounts—namely, that consumers have a choice regarding whether to accept the specific account. In addition, the Bureau believes that this disclosure will, consistent with section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, ensure that the features of the prepaid accounts—again, that consumers have a choice regarding whether to accept the specific account—are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the account.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(f)(3) Disclosures on Prepaid Account Access Devices</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1005.18(b)(7) to require a financial institution to disclose on the prepaid account device itself the name of the financial institution, a Web site URL, and a telephone number that a consumer can use to access information about the prepaid account. Proposed § 1005.18(b)(7) would have provided that, if a financial institution did not provide a physical access device in connection with a prepaid account, this disclosure would have been required to appear at the URL or other entry point a consumer must visit to access the prepaid account electronically. Proposed § 1005.18(b)(7) would have also stated that a disclosure made on an accompanying document, such as a terms and conditions document, on packaging material surrounding an access device, or on a sticker or other label affixed to an access device would not constitute a disclosure on the access device. Proposed comment 18(b)(7)-1 would have clarified that a consumer might use this information disclosed on the access device to contact a financial institution with a question about a prepaid account's terms and conditions, or to report when an unauthorized transaction has occurred involving a prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received no comments regarding these proposed requirements for disclosures on prepaid account devices. The Bureau is thus finalizing proposed § 1005.18(b)(7), renumbered as § 1005.18(f)(3), substantially as proposed, with modifications as to the location of this disclosure at an electronic entry point to the account. The Bureau has also removed from the regulatory text the explanation regarding disclosures made on an accompanying document and included it in final comment 18(f)-3, as discussed below. The Bureau is finalizing this provision pursuant to its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c), and 905(a), and section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, because it will assist consumers in better understanding the terms and conditions of their prepaid accounts, even after they have acquired the account.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also finalizing proposed comment 18(b)(7)-1, renumbered as comment 18(f)-3, with modifications to clarify the examples for why a consumer might use the information disclosed on an access device to contact the financial institution. Specifically, this comment now clarifies that the financial institution must provide this information to allow consumers to, for example, contact the financial institution to learn about the terms and conditions of the prepaid account, obtain prepaid account balance information, request a copy of transaction history pursuant to final § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii) if the financial institution does not provide periodic statements pursuant to § 1005.9(b), or notify the financial institution when the consumer believes that an unauthorized EFT occurred as required by § 1005.7(b)(2) and final § 1005.18(d)(1)(ii). Final comment 18(f)-3 also clarifies that a disclosure made on an accompanying document, such as a terms and conditions document, on packaging material surrounding an access device, or on a sticker or other label affixed to an access device does not constitute a disclosure on the access device. The Bureau believes it is important for a consumer to be able to access fee information, as well as check an account's balance, and have a means for reporting unauthorized transactions, even after a consumer has acquired a prepaid account. Disclosing telephone numbers on an access device will allow consumers to access this information, even if they are not in the location where they retained the disclosures or are unable to access disclosures via the internet.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>30(g) Sender</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.30(f) incorporated the definition of “sender” from EFTA section 919(g)(4) with minor edits for clarity. Specifically, proposed § 205.30(f) defined “sender” to mean “a consumer in a state who requests a remittance transfer provider to send a remittance transfer to a designated recipient.” The final rule adopts the definition largely as proposed in renumbered § 1005.30(g), with additional clarifications and a new explanatory comment.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Several commenters suggested that the Bureau limit remittance transfers to those sent for personal, family, or household purposes. Although Regulation E's applicability is generally limited to such consumer-purpose transactions, the limitation is contained in the definition of “account” in § 1005.2(b). However, the remittance transfer rule applies to more than just account-based transfers. As a result, these commenters stated that an individual who requests a transfer for business purposes could arguably be a “sender” under the rule.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>To address these concerns, the Bureau is revising the definition of “sender” in § 1005.30(g) to clarify that a sender is a consumer in a State who primarily for personal, family, or household purposes requests a remittance transfer provider to send a remittance transfer to a designated recipient. This revision is consistent with § 1005.2(b) and clarifies that the final rule does not apply to business-to-consumer or business-to-business transactions or to transactions that are not for personal, family or household purposes. For example, a transfer requested by a sole proprietor on behalf of his or her company would not be covered by the rule.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As with the definition of “designated recipient,” some commenters requested guidance as to how they should determine whether a consumer is located in a State for account-based transfers. Commenters also requested clarification on how to determine where a consumer is located if the transfer request is made electronically or by telephone, and where the consumer's presence is not readily apparent. To address these questions, new comment 30(g)-1 clarifies that for transfers from an account, whether a consumer is located in a State depends on where the consumer's account is located. If the account is located in a State, the consumer will be located in a State for purposes of the definition of “sender” in § 1005.30(g), notwithstanding comment 3(a)-3. Where a transfer is requested electronically or by telephone and the transfer is not from an account, the provider may make the determination of whether a consumer is located in a State on information that is provided by the consumer and on any records associated with the consumer that it might have, such as an address provided by the consumer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One commenter asked the Bureau to clarify the application of Regulation E's comment 3(a)-3 to subpart B. Comment 3(a)-3 addresses the foreign applicability of Regulation E with respect to EFTs. The proposed definition of “sender” and the proposed commentary did not address how comment 3(a)-3 would apply with respect to remittance transfers that are EFTs, such as international ACH transfers from an account. The statutory definition of “sender,” and thus the definition in § 1005.30(g), does not turn on a consumer's residency; rather, the definition only requires that there be a consumer in a State requesting a remittance transfer. As with the definition of “designated recipient,” the Bureau believes that directing providers to look to the location of the account as a proxy for the location of the sender will create a bright line that will facilitate compliance with the final rule and ease compliance burden. Thus, as discussed above, under the final rule, for remittance transfers from an account, providers must look to the location of the account to determine whether there is a sender, and not the residency of the consumer requesting the transfer. Accordingly, final comment 30(g)-1 clarifies that the provider should make its determination notwithstanding comment 3(a)-3.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Application of the Remittance Rule to U.S. Military Installations Abroad</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As noted in the April Proposal, the Remittance Rule applies when a sender located in a “State” sends funds to a designated recipient at a location in a “foreign country.” <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.30(c) and (g). Further, the Rule specifies that in the context of transfers to or from an account, the Rule's application depends on the location of the account rather than the account owner's physical location at the time of transfer. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comments 30(c)-2.ii and 30(g). The Rule does not, however, specifically address the status of a transfer that is sent to or from a U.S. military installation located in a foreign country, nor does the definition of “State” in subpart A of Regulation E (§ 1005.2(l)) directly address the definition's application to a U.S. military installation.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In the April Proposal, the Bureau recognized that the Remittance Rule's application to transfers sent to and from U.S. military installations located abroad could, in some cases, lead to confusion. Specifically, the Bureau had received inquiries about whether U.S. military installations located abroad should be treated as located in a State or in a foreign country. The Bureau noted that application of the Remittance Rule might also differ depending on whether the transfer was sent to or from a depository institution account or would be picked up by the recipient at a location on the military installation. For example, there could be confusion as to whether the Remittance Rule applies when a consumer in the United States sends a cash transfer to be picked up by a recipient at a financial institution (not into the recipient's account) on a U.S. military base in a foreign country. Depending on whether the financial institution is deemed to be at a location in a “foreign country” or a “State,” the Remittance Rule may or may not apply. There might also be confusion about whether a cash transfer from a consumer on a foreign military installation to a recipient in the surrounding country would be subject to the rule, again depending on whether the foreign military installation is deemed to be in a “State.”</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau noted in the April Proposal, however, that the application of the Remittance Rule could be different for transfers from accounts of persons located on U.S. military installations abroad. When a transfer is made from such an account, whether the sender is located in a State is determined by the location of the sender's account rather than the physical location of the sender at the time of the transaction. Similarly, whether or not the Remittance Rule applies to transfers from the United States to accounts of different persons stationed at U.S. military installations abroad could differ, depending on the locations of those recipients' accounts. Thus, there may also be confusion as to whether the Remittance Rule applies when a transfer is sent from an account in the United States to an account located at a U.S. military installation abroad, to the extent such accounts exist.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In light of the complexity of these issues, the Bureau sought comment on whether it would be advisable to provide further clarity on this point and also sought data regarding these issues. The Bureau acknowledged in the April Proposal that it did not then have sufficient information or data to make a determination regarding whether the Remittance Rule should (or should not) treat foreign military installations as “States” for purposes of the Remittance Rule, both in the context of transfers received in cash and in the context of transfers sent to or from an account that is located on a military installation. Accordingly, the Bureau sought data on the relative number of transfers sent to and from individuals and/or accounts located on U.S. military installations in foreign countries. In addition, the Bureau sought comment on the appropriateness of extending any clarification regarding U.S. military installations to other U.S. government installations abroad, such as U.S. diplomatic missions.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received several comments on this issue. While a small number of commenters reported on the number of transfers they send to overseas military installations, commenters did not provide data on the relative number of transfers sent to and from such installations. The vast majority of commenters, however, recommended that the Bureau treat U.S. military installations abroad as located “on U.S. soil,” and therefore exempt transfers sent to such installations from the Remittance Rule. Commenters favoring this approach provided various rationales. Several commenters, including a large bank, a community bank, and a State trade association, recommended exempting remittance transfers to U.S. military installations abroad from the Rule. They stated that such transfers present lower risks to consumers than remittance transfers sent from the United States to other foreign locations, because transfers involving U.S. military installations are generally sent to and from U.S. financial institutions, in U.S. dollars, using U.S. payment systems (thus subject to the rules of those systems). They further argued that such transfers do not involve fluctuating exchange rates, and will likely be subject to U.S. consumer protection laws (insofar as the recipient institution is a U.S. financial institution).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Other commenters, including community banks, large banks, credit unions, and trade associations, noted that other statutory and regulatory regimes currently treat U.S. military installations located abroad as located in the United States. For example, a large bank noted that deposits in foreign branches of U.S. financial institutions that are located on a U.S. military installation and governed by Department of Defense regulations are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, while deposits in foreign branches that are not located on such installations are not. A national trade association and a federal credit union similarly noted that the U.S. Postal Service treats mail sent from the United States to U.S. military installations overseas as domestic mail. Several other commenters, including a number of credit unions, urged the Bureau to exempt transfers to U.S. military installations abroad because, they claimed, many remittance transfer providers were already treating such installations as located on “U.S. soil.”</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A few commenters did not support treating U.S. military installations as “States” for purposes of the Remittance Rule. One consumer group argued that the Bureau should treat military installations abroad as located in a foreign country because individuals who send remittance transfers to family members stationed abroad should receive the protections of the Remittance Rule. Other commenters, including a group of national trade associations, noted that any solution that applied exclusively to military installations would pose logistical challenges, because it may be difficult to determine whether a recipient or a recipient's account is located on a military installation. These commenters were either silent about how the Bureau should resolve the issue of money transfers to U.S. military installations or advocated that the Bureau maintain the status quo.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Based on its review of the comments received and its own analysis of this issue, the Bureau is persuaded, for the reasons discussed below, that transfers to individuals and accounts located on U.S. military installations located abroad, as well as transfers from individuals and their accounts located on U.S. military installations abroad to designated recipients in the United States, should be excluded from the Remittance Rule's application. Accordingly, the Bureau is finalizing revisions to the commentary to the definitions of “designated recipient” (§ 1005.30(c)) and “sender” (§ 1005.30(g)). These revisions clarify that, for purposes of determining whether a transfer qualifies as a “remittance transfer” under the Rule, persons or accounts that are located on a U.S. military installation abroad are considered to be located in a State. Pursuant to these revisions, revised comment 30(c)-2.i explains that funds that will be received at a location on a U.S. military installation that is physically located abroad are received in a State, and revised comment 30(c)-2.ii explains that, for transfers that are sent to a recipient's account, an account that is located on a U.S. military installation abroad is considered to be located in a State. As revised, comment 30(g)-1 now explains that senders or senders' accounts that are located on U.S. military installations that are physically located abroad are located in a State for purposes of subpart B.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes this approach provides clarity without undermining the important consumer protections provided by the Remittance Rule. The Bureau agrees with the majority of commenters that transfers from the United States to a U.S. military installation located abroad share many of the characteristics of domestic transfers, and as such harbor less risk for consumers than a typical remittance transfer. In sum, while the Bureau agrees that servicemembers and their families deserve to receive the same consumer protections that are available to all other consumers, the Bureau agrees with those commenters who asserted that the consumer protection concerns associated with transfers sent to locations in a foreign country generally do not apply to transfers sent to U.S. military installations abroad. Meanwhile, the Bureau notes that transfers from locations on U.S. military installations abroad to recipients in foreign countries may, in many circumstances, qualify as remittance transfers. Unlike the quasi-domestic nature of transfers to the U.S. military installations abroad, transfers from those installations to foreign countries are typically sent without the protection of laws and rules in place for domestic transfers and are more likely to be involve a foreign currency exchange. The Bureau will continue to monitor, through its complaint intake processes and other channels, whether particular concerns arise with respect to transfers involving U.S. military installations abroad.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau declines to adopt the bright-line test proposed by one money transmitter commenter that would have allowed remittance transfer providers to determine an account's location by looking at whether the account was held with a United States or a foreign financial institution. The Bureau believes that such a rule would be over-broad in that it would exclude transfers that are sent to accounts located in foreign branches of U.S. financial institutions, of which the Bureau believes there are many. Such transfers, with the limited exception of transfers to foreign branches located on U.S. military installations abroad, as discussed above, currently qualify as remittance transfers under the Rule, and the Bureau did not intend to change this result when it proposed to clarify the treatment of U.S. military installations.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau acknowledges that, as noted by a few commenters, there may be some scenarios in which it is impossible for the remittance transfer provider to know that the transfer will be sent to a location or account located on a U.S. military installation. The Bureau notes, however, that such scenarios already exist regardless of whether the transfer involves a U.S. military installation located abroad; indeed, the Bureau has previously addressed these scenarios in existing comment 30(c)-2.iii, which explains that, where a sender does not specify information about a designated recipient's account, a provider may make the determination of whether funds will received in a foreign country based on “other information.” Thus, those providers who currently make a determination about the location of a recipient or a recipient's account by, for example, looking at the routing number and address of the branch of the financial institution receiving the transfer, can continue to do so; the revised commentary merely provides that where they have specific information that the account is located on a U.S. military installation, they can treat the account as located in a State, notwithstanding any information to the contrary derived from the account's routing number.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau is not finalizing a provision that would address the application of the Remittance Rule to other U.S. government installations abroad. The Bureau did not receive any comments indicating that there is actual or potential confusion with respect to the Remittance Rule's application to non-military U.S. installations located in foreign countries.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Non-Consumer Accounts</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.30(g) provides that a “sender” under subpart B of Regulation E means a consumer in a State who primarily for personal, family, or household purposes requests a remittance transfer provider to send a remittance transfer to a designated recipient. Together with the definition of “remittance transfer” in § 1005.30(e), this means that for the Remittance Rule to apply to an electronic transfer of funds, the transfer must have been requested by a consumer primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In response to certain questions about how to determine whether the Remittance Rule applies to transfers sent from an account that is not an account for the purposes of Regulation E, such as a business account, the Bureau proposed to add comment 30(g)-2 to explain that a consumer is a “sender” only if the consumer requests a transfer primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. The proposed comment would have also explained that for transfers from an account, the primary purpose for which the account was established determines whether a transfer from that account is requested for personal, family, or household purposes. Accordingly, under the proposed clarification, a transfer is not requested primarily for personal, family, or household purposes if it is sent from an account that was not established primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, such as an account that was established as a business or commercial account or an account held by a business entity such as a corporation, not-for-profit corporation, professional corporation, limited liability company, partnership, or sole proprietorship, and a person requesting a transfer from such an account therefore is not a sender under § 1005.30(g). Having reviewed the comments received and for the reasons set forth below, the Bureau is adopting comment 30(g)-2 with the modifications explained below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One of the two consumer group commenters supported this aspect of the April Proposal. Industry commenters generally supported clarifying that the Remittance Rule does not apply to transfers sent from business accounts. Several trade association commenters also supported the change but noted that some financial institutions may re-code accounts that were initially set up as consumer accounts as business accounts, based on the way an accountholder uses the account. The trade association commenters asserted that the Bureau should clarify that financial institutions could rely on the way the account is identified in their records at the time the transfer is requested to determine whether the transfer is made for personal, family, or household purposes. One large money transmitter commenter expressed concern about proposed comment 30(g)-2, because it interpreted the proposed comment to mean that a remittance transfer provider must apply the Remittance Rule to any transfer from a consumer account, even if the customer indicates that the transfer is for a business purpose. The commenter asserted that this interpretation would result in compliance burden for some money transmitters. It explained that it offers customers the ability to send transfers from accounts, but because it does not hold the accounts, it does not know whether those accounts are consumer or non-consumer accounts. Therefore, it relies on the purpose of a transfer, as indicated by its customer, to determine if the transfer is a remittance transfer for purposes of the Rule. A large bank commenter requested that the Bureau adopt additional commentary to clarify that the Remittance Rule does not apply to transfers from accounts held by a financial institution under a <em data-original="E-03">bona fide</em> trust agreement because those accounts do not meet the definition of “account” under the general provisions of Regulation E.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has considered the comments and, for reasons discussed in more detail below, is adopting as proposed the aspect of proposed comment 30(g)-2 that would have explained the definition of a “sender.” The Bureau is also adding new comment 30(g)-3, in which it is adopting the aspect of proposed comment 30(g)-2 that would have explained that a transfer sent from a non-consumer account is not requested primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, and therefore a consumer requesting a transfer from such an account is not a sender under § 1005.30(g).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Additionally, the Bureau is explaining in comment 30(g)-3 that a transfer from an account held by a financial institution under a <em data-original="E-03">bona fide</em> trust agreement is also not requested for personal, family, or household purposes, and therefore a consumer requesting a transfer from such an account is not a sender under § 1005.30(g). Section 1005.2(b)(3) provides that the term “account” in Regulation E does not include an account held by a financial institution under a <em data-original="E-03">bona fide</em> trust agreement. The Bureau believes that adding this clarification to comment 30(g)-3 is consistent with the Bureau's intent to clarify that insofar as a transfer is sent from an account, the Remittance Rule only applies to transfers from accounts that fall within the definition of “account” under the general provisions of Regulation E.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is not adopting the aspect of the proposed comment 30(g)-2 that would have explained that the primary purpose for which the account was established determines whether a transfer from that account is for personal, family, or household purposes. Upon further consideration, the Bureau believes that this aspect of the proposed comment could have been interpreted to mean that a provider would have to apply the Remittance Rule to all transfers from a consumer account, even in situations in which the sender indicates that the primary purpose of the transfer is a non-consumer purpose. Although the Bureau continues to believes that a provider should be able to rely on the primary purpose for which the account was established to determine whether a transfer from that account is for personal, family, or household purposes, the Bureau believes that applying the Rule to all transfers from a consumer account, even in situations in which the sender indicates that the primary purpose of the transfer is a non-consumer purpose, would be in tension with the definition of a “sender.” The Bureau is also concerned that such a bright-line test could cause compliance burden, as suggested above by a large money transmitter, if required in all cases. The Bureau further believes that it is appropriate to draw a clear line with respect to the applicability of the Remittance Rule to transfers sent from accounts that were not established primarily for personal, family, or household purposes for providers who have access to that information.
        </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, as adopted, comment 30(g)-2 explains that a consumer is a “sender” only where he or she requests a transfer primarily for personal, family, or household purposes and that a consumer who requests a transfer primarily for other purposes, such as business or commercial purposes, is not a sender under § 1005.30(g). It further explains that if a consumer requests a transfer from an account that was established primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, then a remittance transfer provider may generally deem that the transfer is requested primarily for personal, family, or household purposes and the consumer is therefore a “sender” under § 1005.30(g). However, if the consumer indicates that he or she is requesting the transfer primarily for other purposes, such as business or commercial purposes, then the provider may deem the consumer not to be a sender under § 1005.30(g), even if the consumer is requesting the transfer from an account that is used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 30(g)-3 explains that a provider may deem that a transfer that is requested to be sent from an account that was not established primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, such as an account that was established as a business or commercial account or an account held by a business entity such as a corporation, not-for-profit corporation, professional corporation, limited liability company, partnership, or sole proprietorship, as not being requested primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. A consumer requesting a transfer be sent from such an account therefore is not a sender under § 1005.30(g). The comment also explains that a transfer that is sent from an account held by a financial institution under a <em data-original="E-03">bona fide</em> trust agreement pursuant to § 1005.2(b)(3) is not requested primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, and a consumer requesting a transfer from such an account therefore is not a sender under § 1005.30(g).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Lastly, as discussed above, several trade association commenters suggested that the Bureau adopt guidance that would permit a financial institution to rely on the way an account is identified in its records at the time the transfer is requested (rather than when the account was established) to determine whether the transfer is made primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. The Bureau is not adopting this recommendation. The Bureau proposed comment 30(g)-2 to provide additional clarification that transfers from accounts that do not meet the definition of “account” under the general provisions of Regulation E are not subject to the Remittance Rule. Pursuant to § 1005.2(b)(1), an account at a financial institution is an “account” for purposes of Regulation E if it was “ <em data-original="E-03">established</em> primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.” (Emphasis added.) In other words, the primary purpose for which an account was established determines whether the account is an “account” for purposes of Regulation E. Accordingly, the Bureau believes that adopting this suggestion would be inconsistent with § 1005.2(b)(1), which is a long-standing part of Regulation E. Insofar as commenters did not suggest why accounts should be treated differently for purposes of subpart B of Regulation E, the Bureau is not adopting this suggestion.</analysisParagraph>

Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(v), however, required the transfer amount to be disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be received by the designated recipient to demonstrate to the sender how third party fees or taxes imposed under proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(vi), which are also required to be disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be received, would reduce the amount received by the designated recipient. Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(v), however, only required this repeat disclosure if third party fees or taxes are imposed under proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(vi), because it would not otherwise be necessary to demonstrate a reduction of the transfer amount by third party fees and taxes. The proposed disclosure was required to be described using the term “Transfer Amount” or a substantially similar term. Both the transfer amount required to be disclosed by proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(i) and the transfer amount required to be disclosed by proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(v) were proposed to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comment on the requirement to disclose the transfer amount in proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(v). Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to finalize this requirement as proposed in § 1005.31(b)(1)(v). The Bureau received comments regarding concerns about making disclosures in the currency in which the funds will be received by the designated recipient. These comments, and a clarification regarding the currency in which the funds will be received by the designated recipient, are discussed below. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-1.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(b)(1)-2 provided more guidance on the requirement to repeat the transfer amount disclosure in some circumstances, and it is adopted substantially as proposed. The comment reflects the clarification in the final rule that disclosure under § 1005.31(b)(1)(i) must be disclosed in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded. Comment 31(b)(1)-2 clarifies that two transfer amounts are required to be disclosed by § 1005.31(b)(1)(i) and (v). First, a provider must disclose the transfer amount in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded to show the calculation of the total amount of the transaction. Typically, the remittance transfer is funded in U.S. dollars, so the transfer amount would be expressed in U.S. dollars. However, if remittance transfer is funded, for example, from a Euro-denominated account, the transfer amount would be expressed in Euros.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Second, a provider must disclose the transfer amount in the currency in which the funds will be made available to the designated recipient. For example, if the funds will be picked up by the designated recipient in Japanese yen, the transfer amount would be expressed in Japanese yen. However, the comment also clarifies that this second transfer amount need not be disclosed if fees and taxes are not imposed for the remittance transfer under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). As discussed above, in such cases, there is no consumer benefit to the additional information if the transferred amount is not reduced by other fees and taxes.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(b)(1)(v) also requires a remittance transfer provider to use the term “Transfer Amount” or a substantially similar term to describe the disclosure required under this paragraph. Comment 31(b)(1)-2 clarifies, as proposed, that the terms used to describe each transfer amount should be the same.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau believes that the rounded exchange rate required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) is intended only to ensure that senders are not overwhelmed by a disclosure of an exchange rate with many numbers following the decimal point. The Bureau does not believe it is intended to constrain the number of decimal places involved in calculating other disclosures. Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(1)(v) adds the clarification that the exchange rate used to calculate the transfer amount in § 1005.31(b)(1)(v) is the exchange rate in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by § 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate. Comment 31(b)(1)-3 provides examples to demonstrate the exchange rate that must be used to calculate not only the transfer amount in § 1005.31(b)(1)(v), but also the fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) and the amount received in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii). For example, if one U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9483779 Mexican pesos, a provider must calculate these disclosures using this rate, even though the provider may disclose pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) that the U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9484 Mexican pesos. Similarly, if a provider estimates pursuant to § 1005.32 that one U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9483 Mexican pesos, a provider must calculate these disclosures using this rate, even though the provider may disclose pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) that the U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.95 Mexican pesos (Estimated). If an exchange rate need not be rounded, a provider must use that exchange rate to calculate these disclosures. For example, if one U.S. dollar exchanges for exactly 11.9 Mexican pesos, a provider must calculate these disclosures using this exchange rate.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(b)(1)(v) of the 2012 Final Rule requires remittance transfer providers to disclose the transfer amount in the currency in which the funds will be received by the designated recipient.  Under § 1005.31(b)(1)(v) of the 2012 Final Rule, providers are required to disclose the transfer amount only if applicable fees and taxes are imposed by persons other than the provider under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), in order to demonstrate to the sender how such fees reduce the amount received by the designated recipient.  Insofar as § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) in the 2013 Final Rule will now only require disclosure of covered third-party fees, the Bureau has made conforming changes to the appropriate reference in § 1005.31(b)(1)(v) to clarify that the section implicates covered third-party fees only rather than all fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>33(h)(3)</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.33(h)(2) would have required a remittance transfer provider to demonstrate that the sender had notice that, if the sender provided an incorrect account number, the sender could lose the transfer amount.  Although the Bureau did not propose a specific form of notice under proposed § 1005.33(h)(2), it requested comment on whether the Bureau should specify the form of the notice and when and how such notice should be delivered.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters were largely divided on whether the Bureau should provide specific form and content instructions for the required notice.  However, no commenter objected to the basic requirement of notice, and several commenters affirmatively agreed that notice would be beneficial.  Those commenters who preferred that the Bureau specify a specific form for the required notice, including several smaller depository institutions, argued that model language provided by the Bureau would ease their compliance burden, particularly if there were a safe harbor for its use.  Those commenters who preferred the flexibility of the proposed notice provisions argued that remittance transfer providers may already provide this sort of notice in a number of different forms.  To require, or encourage through a safe harbor, specific model language or a form, these commenters contended, would cause remittance transfer providers to incur additional compliance costs as they would be required to alter existing forms and practices to match whatever the Bureau has established.  In addition, these commenters argued, providers would need additional time to comply with this final rule if they were required to use specific language to provide the proposed notice. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Several consumer group commenters argued that the proposed notice should be provided in a clear and conspicuous manner and in the same language that the rest of the transfer is conducted.  These commenters urged the Bureau to adopt a notice that comports with the clarity and language requirements of similar disclosures in other consumer statutes.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau adopts proposed § 1005.33(h)(2) with three changes as § 1005.33(h)(3).  New § 1005.33(h)(3) provides as a condition of § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) exception, a requirement that the remittance transfer provider provided notice to the sender before the sender made payment for the remittance transfer that, in the event the sender provided an incorrect account number or recipient institution identifier, the sender could lose the transfer amount.  The provision also provides that for purposes of providing the § 1005.33(h)(3) notice, § 1005.31(a)(2) applies to this notice unless the notice is given at the same time as other disclosures required by subpart B for which information is permitted to be disclosed orally or via mobile application or text message, in which case this disclosure may be given in the same medium as the other disclosures</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>This provision reflects three changes from the December Proposal:  (1) Mention of recipient institution identifiers in light of the expanded scope of § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D); (2) clarification that the notice must be provided before the sender authorizes the remittance transfer; (3) clarification that this notice may be given orally if provided along with a prepayment disclosure provided orally in accordance with § 1005.31(a)(2).<footnote ref="11">Section 1005.31(a)(2) generally requires disclosures required by subpart B of Regulation E to be in writing.  The provision makes exceptions for pre-payment disclosures, which may be provided electronically.</footnote>
             The Bureau believes that the requirement that the notice be provided before authorization of the transfer is generally in accordance with how most providers currently provide notice today and thus should not be a significant change from existing practice. The 2013 Final Rule does not specify the form of such notice but the Bureau intends to monitor how providers implement this condition to determine whether additional specificity is appropriate. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that, pursuant to the revisions to § 1005.31(a)(1) discussed above, the notice provided pursuant to § 1005.33(h)(3), like all disclosures required by subpart B of Regulation E, in § 1005.33(h)(3) must be clear and conspicuous. <em data-original="E-03">See also</em> comment 33(a)(1)-1.  In addition, insofar as the Bureau has also amended the foreign language requirements of § 1005.31(g) to apply to all disclosures permitted by the 2013 Final Rule, the notice permitted by § 1005.33(h)(3) must be disclosed in accordance with the foreign language disclosure requirements of § 1005.33(g)(1). </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As explained in the December Proposal, the Bureau's goal is to ensure that senders are informed of the risks of a mistake.  Given that many remittance transfer providers are already providing notices of this risk through various means, the Bureau wants to ensure that the practice is adopted across the remainder of the industry while minimizing the need to change existing notices if they were already sufficient for the purposes of proposed § 1005.33(h)(2).  While the Bureau understands that providing model language might make compliance easier for some providers, the Bureau believes that there are sufficient models available in providers' existing materials that it is inappropriate to delay adoption of this condition while the Bureau designs and tests appropriate model language. </analysisParagraph>

      <title>33(h)(1)</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.33(h)(1) would have required that a remittance transfer provider be able to demonstrate that the sender provided an incorrect account number in connection with the remittance transfer.  The Bureau explained that it did not believe that this proposed condition represented a substantial change from the 2012 Final Rule, which incentivized providers to document whether the sender had provided inaccurate information in order to invoke the right to charge certain related fees in connection with a resent transaction. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) in the 2012 Final Rule.  The Bureau received no comments specific to this proposed condition.  Accordingly, proposed § 1005.33(h)(1) is adopted substantially as proposed, except that it is expanded to apply both to account numbers and recipient institution identifiers, as discussed above.  The comment is also revised to make clear that the provider must be able to demonstrate that the sender provided the incorrect account number or recipient institution identifier, language that was in proposed § 1005.33(h). </analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>Proposed 33(h)(3) would have stated that for a remittance transfer provider to avail itself of the exception in proposed § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D), the provider would be required to demonstrate that the incorrect account number resulted in the deposit of the remittance transfer into a customer's account that is not the designated recipient's. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received a number of comments from industry commenters and some consumer group commenters encouraging the Bureau to eliminate this proposed condition.  These commenters stated that even if funds are not deposited into another customer's account, other forms of improper routing due to erroneous information provided by a sender could cause transferred funds to be lost or, at the very least, delayed beyond the original date of availability.  Other consumer group commenters disagreed, however, asserting that, in their opinion, remittance transfer providers typically can retrieve funds that have been misrouted unless the funds are deposited into the wrong customer's account.  These consumer group commenters opined that so long as the funds remain in an institution's control, there is generally no concern that those funds will disappear. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.33(h)(3) substantially as proposed as § 1005.33(h)(4).  The Bureau believes, as stated in the December Proposal, that when a remittance transfer is sent with the wrong account number for the designated recipient, a remittance transfer provider will be far more likely to recover the funds in situations where the funds are either rejected by another institution or otherwise reversed before they are deposited into the wrong account.  To the extent that commenters' concerns related to the delay of funds rather than their disappearance, as noted above, the Bureau declines to expand the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to cover delayed transfers rather than actual mis-deposited transfers. </analysisParagraph>

      <title>33(h)(5)</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed 33(h)(4) would have required a remittance transfer provider to promptly use reasonable efforts to recover the amount that was to be received by the designated recipient.  Proposed comment 33(h)-1 would have clarified how a provider might use reasonable efforts to recover funds.  The Bureau received several comments on the proposed provision and associated commentary. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters and consumer groups agreed with this proposed condition.  These commenters approved of its flexibility and one industry commenter noted that it was in accordance with its preexisting practice, which is to exercise best efforts to recover missing funds.  Two other commenters—a trade association and credit union—asked that the Bureau provide more explanation regarding the timeframe to meet the promptness requirement and the number of attempts to recover the funds required.  These commenters were concerned that the lack of clarity would invite litigation as to whether a particular remittance transfer provider's efforts were in fact reasonable and prompt. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, one commenter asked that the Bureau clarify that a recipient institution, even if also the remittance transfer provider, not be required to debit an account that has a zero balance.  In other words, this commenter sought clarity on whether it would be required to advance funds on behalf of a customer if that customer has withdrawn the transfer amount from the customer's account.  The Bureau does not believe clarification on this point is necessary, insofar as nothing in the 2013 Final Rule states that a provider is required to advance funds that the recipient institution cannot retrieve from a customer if the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) applies.  Rather, the 2013 Final Rule has the opposite intent—the exception is intended to apply when funds cannot be retrieved. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, the Bureau is finalizing proposed § 1005.33(h)(4) substantially as proposed as § 1005.33(h)(5).  The Bureau continues to believe—as it explained in the December Proposal—that it is not appropriate to mandate specific methods that a remittance transfer provider must use to attempt to recover funds.  The Bureau believes the circumstances around individual transfers can vary greatly and that what may be reasonable in one circumstance may be unreasonable in another. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau is adopting proposed comment 33(h)-1 substantially as proposed as comment 33(h)-2 with minor revisions to improve clarity and to replace one of the proposed examples.  The Bureau is also incorporating proposed comment 33(h)-1.iii to comment 33(h)-1, which now states that § 1005.33(h)(5) requires a remittance transfer provider to use reasonable efforts to recover the amount that was to be received by the designated recipient.  Whether a provider has used reasonable efforts does not depend on whether the provider is ultimately successful in recovering the amount that was to be received by the designated recipient.  Under § 1005.33(h)(5), if the remittance transfer provider is requested to provide documentation or other supporting information in order for the pertinent institution or authority to obtain the proper authorization for the return of the incorrectly credited amount, reasonable efforts to recover the amount include timely providing any such documentation to the extent that it is available and permissible under law.  The two examples in proposed comments 33(h)-1.i and .ii are finalized as proposed as comments 33(h)-2.i. and .ii.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 33(h)-2 would have explained that the proposed condition requires a remittance transfer provider to act promptly in using reasonable efforts to recover the amount that was to be received by the designated recipient.  The Bureau received comments from industry that it should clarify when exactly reasonable efforts are considered to be prompt and also that it should create a safe harbor time period in which efforts would be deemed prompt.  The Bureau continues to believe that whether a particular provider's efforts are prompt depends on the facts and circumstances, for instance when the fact of an error is first identified.  In general, the Bureau believes a provider acts promptly where it acts before the date that the funds are expected to be made available to the recipient, but a provider may not have notice that there is a problem with the transfer that early.  Accordingly, the Bureau has adopted proposed comment 33(h)-2 as comment 33(h)-3 and is expanding its discussion.  The comment adopts the proposed language explaining that § 1005.33(h)(5) requires that a remittance transfer provider act promptly in using reasonable efforts to recover the amount that was to be received by the designated recipient and that whether a provider acts promptly to use reasonable efforts depends on the facts and circumstances.  The comment also provides an example stating that where a sender informs the provider that he or she had provided a mistaken account number before the date of availability disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii), the provider has acted promptly if it attempts to contact the institution that received the incorrect remittance transfer before the disclosed date of availability. </analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.32(b)(1) allowed estimates to be provided for the exchange rate, transfer amount, other fees and taxes, and total to recipient disclosures (adopted as § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) through (vii) above), if a remittance transfer provider cannot determine exact amounts because the laws of the recipient country do not permit such a determination.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters raised concerns about whether remittance transfer providers have the resources to determine whether this exception applies. Consumer group commenters argued that the statute requires the Bureau to determine which recipient countries qualify for the permanent exception, rather than leaving the determination to individual market participants. Both industry and consumer group commenters recommended that the Bureau maintain a list of countries or a database, updated annually, to which the permanent exception based on the laws of a recipient country would apply.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that it is appropriate for remittance transfer providers to identify and comply with a recipient country's currency laws. The Bureau also believes that remittance transfer providers and their correspondents generally are able to obtain this information because they are engaged in the business of remittance transfers to recipient countries and must comply with any applicable law that prevents the remittance transfer provider from determining exchange rates or exact amounts. Nonetheless, in response to comments received and upon further consideration, the Bureau is revising proposed § 205.32(b) to facilitate compliance by providing a safe harbor list of countries which qualify for the permanent exception.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, the Bureau is renumbering proposed § 205.32(b) as § 1005.32(b)(1) and adopting new § 1005.32(b)(2) to provide a safe harbor. New § 1005.32(b)(2) states that a remittance transfer provider may rely on the list of countries published by the Bureau to determine whether estimates may be provided under the permanent exception, unless the provider has information that a country's laws or the method by which transactions are conducted in that country permits a determination of the exact disclosure amount.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau is adopting commentary on new § 1005.32(b)(2). New comment 32(b)-5 provides guidance on the safe harbor list published by the Bureau. New comment 32(b)-6 provides further guidance on reliance on the Bureau-provided list of countries that qualify for the permanent exception. New comment 32(b)-7 addresses circumstance where there is a change in laws of the recipient country.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 32(b)(1)-1 clarified that the “laws of the recipient country” do not permit a remittance transfer provider to determine exact amounts when a law or regulation of the recipient country requires the person making funds directly available to the designated recipient to apply an exchange rate that is: (i) Set by the government of the recipient country after the remittance transfer provider sends the remittance transfer; or (ii) set when the designated recipient chooses to claim the funds. Comment 32(b)(1)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed, but renumbered as comment 32(b)-1 for organizational purposes.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One commenter requested clarification about whether proposed comment 32(b)(1)-1 covered instances where the local currency is thinly traded and the laws of a recipient country require an authorized dealer to set the exchange rate when the remittance transfer is received. The Bureau believes that the proposed comment already covers such circumstances because the government of the recipient country, acting through an authorized dealer, sets the exchange rate after the remittance transfer has been sent. In addition, the transfer may also qualify for the permanent exception if the exchange rate is required by law to be set by the authorized dealer when the recipient claims the funds.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comments 32(b)(1)-2.i. and 32(b)(1)-2.ii. provided examples illustrating the application of the exception. Proposed comment 32(b)(1)-2.i. explained that the laws of the recipient country do not permit a remittance transfer provider to determine the exact exchange rate required to be disclosed under proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(iv) (adopted as § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) above) when, for example, the government of the recipient country sets the exchange rate daily and the funds are made available to the designated recipient in the local currency the day after the remittance transfer provider sends the remittance transfer. Under such circumstances, an estimate for the exchange rate would be permitted because the remittance transfer provider cannot determine a rate that a foreign government has yet to set.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In contrast, proposed comment 32(b)(1)-2.ii. explained that the laws of the recipient country permit a remittance transfer provider to determine the exact exchange rate required to be disclosed under proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(iv) (adopted as § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) above) if, for example, the government of the recipient country ties the value of its currency to the U.S. dollar. The Bureau did not receive significant comment on comment 32(b)(1)-2. This comment is adopted substantially as proposed, but renumbered as comment 32(b)-2 for organizational purposes.</analysisParagraph>

Under the proposal, the transfer amount would have to be disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be transferred because the Board believed the disclosure of the transfer amount would help demonstrate to a sender how a provider calculates the total amount of the transaction, discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters agreed that the disclosure of the transfer amount as a separate line item would help senders understand the total amount to be paid in order to send the requested amount of currency to a recipient. Industry commenters asked the Bureau to clarify how to make a disclosure in the currency in which funds will be transferred. These commenters asked if this requirement only applied where a remittance transfer provider performed the conversion. These commenters suggested that the final rule should clarify that the disclosures should be provided in the denomination of the account used to fund the transfer or in the currency submitted by the sender for the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that the transfer amount should be disclosed as proposed in order to help demonstrate the cost of the transfer to a sender.

For clarity, the final rule provides that the transfer amount must be disclosed in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, rather than the currency in which funds will be transferred. The Bureau believes that disclosing the transfer amount in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded—whether the sender pays with cash, with currency in an account, or by other means—will, when combined with the other required disclosures, help senders calculate the effect of the exchange rate on the transaction, if there is a currency exchange. For example, if the funds will be exchanged from U.S. dollars to Mexican pesos, the transfer amount required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(i) must be disclosed in U.S. dollars. Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(1)(i) provides that the remittance transfer provider must disclose the amount that will be transferred to the designated recipient, in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, using the term “Transfer Amount” or a substantially similar term.</analysisParagraph>

Specifically, § 1005.11(c)(1) and (3)(i) requires that a financial institution, after receiving notice that a consumer believes an EFT from the consumer's account was not authorized, must investigate promptly and determine whether an error occurred (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> whether the transfer was unauthorized), within 10 business days (20 business days if the EFT occurred within 30 days of the first deposit to the account). Upon completion of the investigation, the financial institution must report the investigation's results to the consumer within three business days. After determining that an error occurred, the financial institution must correct an error within one business day.<footnote ref="487">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; § 1005.11(c)(1).</footnote>
             Under EFTA section 909(b), the burden of proof is on the financial institution to show that an alleged error was in fact an authorized transaction; if the financial institution cannot establish proof of valid authorization, the financial institution must credit the consumer's account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1005.11(c)(2) provides that if the financial institution is unable to complete the investigation within 10 business days, its investigation may take up to 45 days if it provisionally credits the amount of the alleged error back to the consumer's account within 10 business days of receiving the error notice.<footnote ref="488">The financial institution has 90 days (instead of 45) if the claimed unauthorized EFT was not initiated in a State, resulted from a point-of-sale debit card transaction, or occurred within 30 days after the first deposit to the account was made. § 1005.11(c)(3)(ii).</footnote>
             Pursuant to § 1005.11(c)(2)(i)(A), provisional credit is not required if the financial institution requires but does not receive written confirmation within 10 business days of an oral notice by the consumer. Pursuant to § 1005.11(d)(2), if the investigation establishes proof that the transaction was, in fact, authorized, the financial institution may reverse any provisional credit previously extended (assuming there are still available funds in the account).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1005.18(c)(4) provides that, for payroll card accounts following the periodic statement alternative in existing § 1005.18(b), the period for reporting an unauthorized transaction is tied, in part, to the date the consumer electronically accesses the consumer's account pursuant to existing § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii), provided that the electronic account history made available to the consumer reflects the alleged error, or the date the financial institution sends a written history of the consumer's account transactions requested by the consumer pursuant to existing § 1005.18(b)(1)(iii) in which the alleged error is first reflected. The Bureau notes that this provision only modifies the 60-day period for consumers to report an error and does not alter any other provision of § 1005.11.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to extend to all prepaid accounts the error resolution provisions of Regulation E, including provisional credit, with modifications to the § 1005.11 timing requirements in proposed § 1005.18(e)(2) for financial institutions following the periodic statement alternative in proposed § 1005.18(c)(1). The text of proposed § 1005.18(e)(2) updated internal paragraph citations to reflect other numbering changes made in the proposal, but otherwise was unchanged from existing § 1005.18(c)(4). Notably, as set forth in greater detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(e)(3) below, the Bureau also proposed an exception to the requirement to provide limited liability and error resolution when a financial institution had not completed collection of consumer identifying information and identity verification for a prepaid account, assuming appropriate notice of the risk of not registering the prepaid account had been provided to the consumer. The Bureau proposed to extend to all prepaid accounts existing comment 18(c)-1 regarding the 120-day error resolution safe harbor provision, renumbered as comment 18(e)-1 and with the reference to payroll card accounts changed to prepaid accounts. The Bureau also proposed to extend existing comment 18(c)-2, regarding consumers electronically accessing their account history, to all prepaid accounts, renumbered as comment 18(e)-2. In that proposed comment, the reference to payroll card account was changed to prepaid account, plus one substantive modification to clarify that access to account information via a mobile application, as well as through a web browser, would constitute electronic access to an account for purposes of the timing provisions in proposed § 1005.18(e)(1) and (2). The Bureau also proposed to add an additional sentence to the end of proposed comment 18(e)-2 to explain that a consumer would not be deemed to have accessed a prepaid account electronically when the consumer receives an automated text message or other automated account alert, or checks the account balance by telephone.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to extend existing comment 18(c)-3, regarding untimely notice of error by a consumer, to all prepaid accounts, renumbered as comment 18(e)-3 and with internal paragraph citations updated to reflect other numbering changes made in the proposal. The last sentence of the existing comment currently provides that where the consumer's assertion of error involves an unauthorized EFT, the institution must comply with § 1005.6 before it may impose any liability on the consumer. The Bureau proposed to specifically note that compliance with § 1005.6 included compliance with the extension of time limits provided in § 1005.6(b)(4).</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Most industry commenters and all consumer group commenters generally supported the proposal to extend to all prepaid accounts the error resolution provisions currently applicable to payroll card accounts. At the same time, several industry commenters argued that prepaid accounts may have a higher incidence of fraudulently asserted errors than other accounts covered by Regulation E for a number of reasons, including that prepaid accounts are often purchased anonymously; prepaid cards are easier to abandon and are more frequently abandoned by consumers who quickly spend down the balance and discard the card; and prepaid consumers may not have any other ongoing relationship with the issuing bank or program manager. Requiring financial institutions to provide error resolution rights to all prepaid accounts, they argued, would thus result in unsustainable fraud losses for industry, leading to market exit and rising consumer costs. These commenters did not, however, provide any data or particular details in support of their assertions. To avoid this result, these commenters urged the Bureau to limit the application of the error resolution provisions to prepaid accounts in certain respects.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters, including issuing banks, program managers, a payment network, and an industry trade association, urged the Bureau not to require error resolution for certain types of prepaid accounts, such as reload packs or cards that cannot be reloaded.<footnote ref="489">Several industry commenters requested that the Bureau exempt all non-reloadable prepaid cards, including reload packs, from the definition of prepaid account in proposed § 1005.2(b)(3), thereby excluding such cards from all rule requirements, including error resolution and limited liability requirements. These comments are discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.2(b)(3) above.</footnote>
             These commenters argued that these products are not transaction account substitutes, and as such should not receive the same protections as other accounts covered under Regulation E. In addition, the commenters argued that fraudulently asserted error claims are more likely to occur on non-reloadable cards, since the cards are mostly unregistered and used for a short period of time. The commenters also stated that the operating margins on these types of cards are slim and argued that, therefore, the costs of providing complete limited liability and error resolution protections, including provisional credit, would outweigh any profits and thus force providers of such products to pass on costs to consumers or exit the market.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters, including several issuing banks, a payment network, and a number of trade associations, expressed particular concern about the requirement to extend provisional credit to prepaid accounts. The issuing bank commenters confirmed that they currently extend provisional credit where appropriate for most types of prepaid accounts. These issuing banks and other industry commenters argued, however, that a mandate requiring them to extend provisional credit would increase their fraud-related costs by emboldening wrongdoers to submit more fraudulent error claims. The commenters urged the Bureau to take one of several approaches to limit the provisional credit requirement. One group of commenters, including several issuing banks and a trade association, suggested that the provisional credit requirement be limited to prepaid accounts held by consumers with whom the issuer has an “ongoing relationship,” as evidenced, for example, by repeated electronic deposits to the prepaid account. Another group of commenters, including an industry trade association and an issuing bank, urged the Bureau not to require provisional credit for accounts or transaction types that exhibit characteristics correlated with a heightened risk of fraud. Commenters suggested varied and at times inconsistent ideas about what these characteristics might be, ranging from, for example, the age of the account, how soon after account opening the alleged error occurred, or whether the transaction occurred at the point of sale or at an ATM.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Commenters who recommended limiting provisional credit also argued that the aggregate amount of fraud losses related to provisional credit increases as the time period within which a financial institution must provide provisional credit decreases, and that 10 business days is not long enough to complete an investigation for errors asserted on prepaid accounts. Accordingly, a number of commenters urged the Bureau to extend the 10 business days permitted under § 1005.11(c)(1) to 20 business days for all prepaid accounts, and 30 business days for prepaid accounts held by consumers who do not have an ongoing relationship with the financial institution. Similarly, a payment network and a law firm writing on behalf of a coalition of prepaid issuers requested that financial institutions have flexibility to delay granting provisional credit beyond 10 business days where a factors-based test indicated that there was a significant risk of loss related to the extension of provisional credit.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consumer advocates, by contrast, argued against rolling back the provisional crediting requirements. They noted that prepaid accounts are used in substantially similar ways as traditional consumer transaction accounts and thus should receive protections for funds lost due to unauthorized use in the same timeframe as other accounts covered by Regulation E. The commenters repeatedly emphasized how important provisional credit can be for consumers, noting that many consumers who use prepaid cards have limited liquid assets and may put a substantial portion of those assets into their prepaid accounts. Without provisional credit, in the event of an unauthorized transfer, a consumer could be without critical funds for the duration of the financial institution's investigation—up to 45 days, or 90 days in certain circumstances.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several consumer groups also commented on the timelines in proposed § 1005.18(e)(2) governing when a consumer must report an unauthorized transfer in order to receive error resolution protections, arguing that the current regime is confusing. For example, they noted that the 120-day safe harbor in proposed § 1005.18(e)(2)(ii) is not disclosed on the error resolution notice required by proposed § 1005.18(d)(1)(ii).<footnote ref="490">As discussed above, these provisions were proposed largely unchanged from existing § 1005.18(c)(4)(ii) and (2), respectively. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See also&lt;/em&gt; appendix A-7.</footnote>
             Consumers may not be aware, therefore, that a different time limit applies to their prepaid account, and may believe their error was timely reported when in fact it was not, or they may fail to report an error that they believed was no longer timely when in fact it was. In addition, the commenters stated that many consumers do not receive paper statements and never access their account information online, so, they argued, a timeline that runs from the date they access their account information should not apply to them. For these reasons, the consumer groups urged the Bureau to adopt a single, uniform time limit of 120 days from the date the transaction was posted to the consumer's account. A number of trade associations representing credit unions also argued that the error resolution reporting timeline should run from the date the transaction was posted to the consumer's account, for the reason that the posting date is an objective and easily discernible point in time. These commenters, however, urged the Bureau to make the timeline a uniform 60 days from the date the transaction was posted.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is finalizing § 1005.18(e)(2) and comments 18(e)-1, -2, and -3 largely as proposed, with minor revisions for clarity and consistency. To further the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account users and to facilitate compliance with its provisions, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority pursuant to EFTA section 904(c) to modify the timing requirements of EFTA section 909(a).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has considered the comments regarding the implications of extending all of Regulation E's error resolution requirements to prepaid accounts. The Bureau acknowledged in the proposal that prepaid accounts might present unique fraud risks that other transaction accounts may not. The Bureau also acknowledges that these risks may be especially heightened with respect to prepaid accounts that have not been or cannot be registered or whose cardholder identity has not or cannot be verified. It was for these reasons that the Bureau proposed in § 1005.18(e)(3) to exempt financial institutions from the requirement to provide limited liability or error resolution protections, including provisional credit, for accounts with respect to which the financial institution had not completed its consumer identification and verification process. The Bureau is finalizing a limited exemption as to provisional credit, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(e)(3) below, but is not exempting financial institutions from the general requirement to provide limited liability and error resolution protections for such accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is not persuaded by commenters that the unique risks posed by prepaid accounts warrant modifications to Regulation E's limited liability and error resolution regime beyond the final rule's accommodation for provisional credit on unverified accounts. Indeed, the Bureau understands that most prepaid issuers already provide error resolution with respect to most prepaid accounts, in compliance with the Payroll Card Rule <footnote ref="491">As discussed above, the FMS Rule requires that the issuer of a prepaid card that receives a Federal payment must comply with the error resolution and provisional credit requirements for payroll cards accounts in Regulation E. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 31 CFR 210.5(b)(5). The Bureau understands that prepaid cards that receive Federal payments and, as discussed previously, by extension many other prepaid cards that are eligible to receive Federal payments if the consumer so chooses, already comply with these provisions. In addition, the Bureau notes that the four major payment card networks' rules all impose some form of zero liability protections for cardholders in certain circumstances. At least one network, for example, requires provisional credit to be given after five days for unauthorized transactions occurring over its network, unless certain exceptions apply.</footnote>
             (though, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(e)(3) below, the Bureau understands that most financial institutions do not provide provisional credit for accounts that cannot be registered). Indeed, in its Study of Prepaid Account Agreements, the Bureau found that across all agreements reviewed, 77.85 percent provided full error resolution with provisional credit protections; 12.31 percent provided error resolution with limitations on provisional credit; 9.23 percent provided error resolution without provisional credit; and 0.62 provided no error resolution protections.<footnote ref="492">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Study of Prepaid Account Agreements at 13 tbl.3. Because these statistics weight all agreements equally, and thus do not reflect individual programs' or providers' market shares, the Bureau also specifically analyzed the 22 agreements for GPR card programs in the Study that belong to five of the largest program managers in the GPR card market. The Bureau found that 17 of these agreements provided full error resolution protections with provisional credit, three provided error resolution with limitations on provisional credit, and two provided error resolution without provisional credit. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See id.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
             The Bureau notes that industry commenters did not dispute the findings of the Bureau's Study nor did they provide any data or particular details in support of their premise that the Bureau's codification of their own existing practices would result in unsustainable fraud losses for the industry. The Bureau thus does not believe that modifications to Regulation E's limited liability and error resolution regime for all prepaid accounts is necessary, and in fact the Bureau has scaled back the exclusion for unverified accounts in proposed § 1005.18(e)(3), discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also declines to categorically exempt non-reloadable cards from the error resolution requirements, as some industry commenters had urged. The Bureau notes that non-reloadable cards can be used to disburse large sums of money to consumers. For example, prepaid accounts that are used to disburse insurance proceeds, tax refunds, or non-recurring employment benefits such as bonuses or termination payments are—or could be—non-reloadable. The funds held in such accounts may be particularly important to a consumer, who may have, for example, lost a home or a job; error resolution is especially critical for a consumer in that position who has been victimized by fraud. The Bureau does not anticipate that the requirement to provide error resolution rights to non-reloadable cards specifically should place a significant regulatory burden on industry.<footnote ref="493">Pursuant to final § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D) and comment 2(b)(3)(i)-8.v, an account whose only function is to make a one-time transfer of funds into a separate prepaid account, such as a reload pack, is excluded from the final rule. As such, the request to specifically exempt them from § 1005.18(e) is moot.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Likewise, the Bureau declines to exempt certain types of accounts or transactions from the requirement to provisionally credit a consumer's account in the event a financial institution takes longer than permitted by § 1005.11(c)(1) (or § 1005.11(c)(3)(i), as applicable) to investigate an error. The Bureau understands, as noted by consumer group commenters, that consumers who use prepaid accounts may have limited liquid assets and may place or hold a substantial portion of those assets in the prepaid account. Without provisional credit, in the event of an unauthorized transaction or other error, a consumer could be without access to those funds for as long as 90 days, a period of time that could cause a significant disruption to the consumer's household finances. In addition, the Bureau notes that there appears to be no industry consensus around the criteria the Bureau should use as a proxy for an account or transaction's relative riskiness for purposes of determining whether it should be excluded from the provisional credit requirements.<footnote ref="494">The Bureau recognized this issue in the proposal. In discussing potential alternatives to the proposed limited liability and error resolution regime, the Bureau considered and rejected several criteria for evaluating an account's riskiness, such as whether the account had been opened for a certain period of time or whether it received direct deposits, concluding that each had serious drawbacks. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 79 FR 77102, 77184 (Dec. 23, 2014).</footnote>
             Finally, although a significant proportion of industry comment letters voiced some opposition to the proposed provisional crediting requirements, the Bureau understands that most financial institutions are already providing error resolution, including provisional credit, for most prepaid accounts. Therefore, once again, the Bureau does not believe that requiring provisional credit for most prepaid account types should add significant additional costs or otherwise be problematic for industry.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to the suggestions that the Bureau extend the time periods that apply before a financial institution must extend provisional credit, the Bureau notes that, under both the proposal and the final rule, the 20-day time frame requested by some commenters already applies in some circumstances—specifically, financial institutions may take up to 20 business days to investigate errors asserted with respect to transfers that occurred within 30 days of the date of the first deposit into the account.<footnote ref="495">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; § 1005.11(c)(3)(i).</footnote>
             In other words, new accounts, which some commenters indicated are more prone to fraudulent error claims, are already given a longer provisional crediting time frame under Regulation E.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to the suggestion that financial institutions have 30 business days to investigate errors before provisionally crediting the consumer's account, the Bureau notes that, depending on calendar timing, 30 business days could be nearly as long or longer than the 45 calendar days financial institutions currently have to investigate claims when provisional credit is provided.<footnote ref="496">Depending on holiday schedules and other factors, 30 business days could be longer than 45 calendar days. For example, 30 business days from December 1, 2016 would end on January 17, 2017, whereas 45 calendar days from December 1, 2016 would end two days earlier, on January 15, 2017.</footnote>
             Thus, a rule that extended the pre-provisional credit investigation period to 30 business days would in effect be doing away with the provisional credit requirement altogether for prepaid accounts. For the reasons stated above, the Bureau believes that provisional credit is an important consumer protection, especially for consumers who rely on a prepaid account as the primary means to store and transact with their funds. The Bureau declines to adjust the investigation time periods in such a way as to essentially obviate the provisional credit requirements for prepaid accounts. Finally, with respect to the time limits that apply to a consumer's timely reporting of an error, the Bureau also declines to revise the applicable limits as requested by some commenters. Again, the Bureau notes that the 60-day limit governing how long a consumer has to report an unauthorized transfer is set by statute in EFTA section 908(a). The Bureau did not intend to generally revise that timeline in this rulemaking.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting proposed comment 18(e)-3 with a revision to correct an existing scrivener's error. That comment previously stated that financial institutions were not required to comply with the requirements of § 1005.11 with respect to transfers that occurred more than 60 days prior to when a consumer accessed the account or the financial institution sent a written account history. This is a misstatement of existing § 1005.18(c)(4)(i)(A) and (B) (renumbered in this final rule as § 1005.18(e)(2)(i)(A) and (B)), which state that financial institutions must comply with § 1005.11 with respect to notices of error received by the earlier of 60 days after the consumer accesses the account or 60 days after the financial institution sends a written history of the account upon the consumer's request.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(e)(3) Error Resolution for Unverified Accounts</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(e)(3) would have provided that for prepaid accounts that are not payroll card accounts or government benefit accounts, if a financial institution disclosed to the consumer the risks of not registering a prepaid account using a notice that is substantially similar to the proposed notice contained in paragraph (c) of appendix A-7, a financial institution would not be required to comply with the liability limits and error resolution requirements under §§ 1005.6 and 1005.11 for any prepaid account for which it has not completed its collection of consumer identifying information and identity verification.<footnote ref="497">Relatedly, the Bureau proposed to require that financial institutions include on the short form disclosure for all prepaid accounts a statement emphasizing the importance of registering the prepaid account. See the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(2)(xi) above.</footnote>
             However, once the consumer's identity had been verified, a financial institution would have had to limit the consumer's liability for unauthorized EFTs and resolve any errors that occurred prior to verification subject to the timing requirements of existing §§ 1005.6 or 1005.11, or the modified timing requirements in proposed § 1005.18(e), as applicable.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 18(e)-4 would have explained that for the purpose of compliance with proposed § 1005.18(e)(3), consumer identifying information could include the consumer's full name, address, date of birth, and Social Security number or other government-issued identification number. The comment would have also explained that for an unauthorized transfer or an error asserted on a previously unverified prepaid account, whether a consumer has timely reported the unauthorized transfer or alleged error was based on the date the consumer contacted the financial institution to report the unauthorized transfer or alleged error, not the date the financial institution completed its customer identification and verification process. Comment 18(e)-4 would have further explained that for an error asserted on a previously unverified prepaid account, the time limits for a financial institution's investigation of errors pursuant to § 1005.11(c) began on the day following the date the financial institution completed its customer identification and verification process. A financial institution may not delay completing its customer identification and verification process, or refuse to verify a consumer's identity, based on the consumer's assertion of an error.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau stated its understanding that financial institutions often conduct customer identification and verification at the onset of a relationship with a consumer, such as at the time a consumer signs up to receive wages via a payroll card account or when a consumer requests a GPR card online. For GPR cards purchased at retail stores, the financial institution may—but does not always—obtain customer-identifying information and perform verification at the time the consumer calls or goes online to activate the card. Because of restrictions imposed by FinCEN's Prepaid Access Rule <footnote ref="498">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 31 CFR 1022.210(d)(1)(iv).</footnote>
             and the payment card networks' operating rules, among other things, the Bureau understood that customer identification and verification was almost always performed before a card can be reloaded, used to make cash withdrawals, or used to receive cash back at the point of sale. The Bureau believed that providers thus had an incentive to encourage consumers to register their cards to increase the functionality and thus the longevity of the consumer's use of the account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Collection of consumer identifying information and verification of identity under proposed § 1005.18(e)(3) would have included information collected, and identities verified, by a financial institution directly as well as by a service provider or agent of the institution. Thus, the Bureau expected that financial institutions providing prepaid accounts for purposes such as student financial aid disbursements or property or casualty insurance payments would likely not be able to avail themselves of the exclusion in § 1005.18(e)(3) because consumer identifying information was collected and consumers' identities verified by the financial institution, or a service provider or agent of the institution, prior to distribution of such prepaid accounts. The Bureau proposed to adopt the exemption for unverified accounts because it understood that a financial institution could face difficulties in determining whether an unauthorized transaction occurred if it did not know a prepaid accountholder's identity. For example, a financial institution could have a video recording provided by a merchant or ATM operator showing the card user, but without having identified the accountholder, it would have no way of knowing if the individual conducting the transaction is authorized to do so.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believed that financial institutions would follow the customer identification and verification requirements set forth in FinCEN's CIP requirements for banks in 31 CFR 1020.220 or for providers and sellers of prepaid access in 31 CFR 1022.210(d)(1)(iv). However, it sought comment on whether FinCEN's regulations, as discussed above, were the appropriate standard to use for identification and verification of prepaid accountholders, or whether some other standard should be used. Further, the Bureau anticipated that when a consumer called to assert an error on an unverified account, the financial institution would inform the consumer of its policy regarding error resolution on unverified accounts and would begin the customer identification and verification process at that time. As noted previously, the Bureau believed that providers had an incentive to encourage consumers to register their cards to increase the functionality and thus the longevity of the consumer's use of the account. However, the Bureau sought comment on the accuracy of this assumption, and on whether the Bureau should impose a time limit for completion of the customer identification and verification process.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>All consumer group commenters expressed support for the Bureau's decision to extend error resolution and limited liability protections to prepaid accounts. Several consumer group commenters detailed at great length the importance of providing consumers—especially consumers who may have a hard time making ends meet—with recourse if their accounts are subject to error or fraud. Thus, while a number of consumer groups expressed cautious support for the proposed limitation on protections for unregistered accounts, stating that they believed it struck a good balance between protecting consumers and ensuring that the rule does not encourage additional fraudulent activity, a number of consumer groups urged the Bureau to revise proposed § 1005.18(e)(3) to require complete limited liability and error resolution for additional account or transaction types. Specifically, one consumer group urged the Bureau to always require limited liability and error resolution where the consumer has a proof of purchase, while another consumer group urged the Bureau to always require the protections with respect to send-money transactions since, it asserted, innocent errors were more likely to occur with respect to that type of transaction. Two other consumer groups asked the Bureau to expand the exclusion of government benefit accounts and payroll card accounts in proposed § 1005.18(e)(3) to explicitly extend to other account types with respect to which the financial institution collects personally identifiable information in order to disburse the funds. For example, they noted that, for accounts such as those used to disburse student loans or insurance proceeds, the financial institution must collect personally identifiable information about the account recipient before distributing the access device. For such accounts, the financial institution has the information it needs to verify a consumer's identity, and as such, should not be eligible for the exemption from the requirement to provide limited liability and error resolution protections.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, two consumer groups expressed concern that the Bureau's decision to exempt unregistered accounts from the requirement to provide error resolution and limited liability protections would incentivize issuers to avoid registering accounts. They urged the Bureau to require registration for all prepaid accounts, arguing that, if registration were not a requirement, financial institutions may try to prevent consumers from registering, and then use the fact of an account's non-registration and verification as a pretext for not providing that account with complete limited liability and error resolution protections. Going further, a city government agency for consumer affairs objected to any limitation on protections for unregistered accounts, arguing that consumers who do not have a chance to register their accounts before becoming victims of fraud nonetheless deserve equal protections under Regulation E.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters expressed support for the Bureau's approach in proposed § 1005.18(e)(3) of not requiring limited liability or error resolution for accounts for which the financial institution had not completed its collection and verification of consumer identifying information. By contrast, there was significant industry opposition to the provision requiring that, once an account was registered and verified, financial institutions provide limited liability and error resolution rights, including provisional credit, for transactions that occurred <em data-original="E-03">prior</em> to registration. One trade association stated that, for prepaid accounts for which customer identification and verification is attempted but cannot be completed, it would support those accounts receiving some error resolution protections pending completion of the process, but not provisional credit. Other commenters, including a number of trade associations, a program manager, and a payment processor, argued on the one hand that applying limited liability and error resolution provisions to pre-registration errors would greatly increase fraud losses, since it was extremely difficult to investigate an error that occurred before the financial institution knew the identity of the cardholder. On the other hand, these commenters argued that requiring full limited liability and error resolution protections for pre-registration errors would not confer significant additional benefits on consumers since it was unlikely that an error or fraudulent transaction would occur prior to registration.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A program manager and a credit union objected to proposed § 1005.18(e)(3) for slightly different reasons: They viewed it as a requirement that financial institutions conduct consumer identification and identity verification for all prepaid accounts. The program manager, which manages non-reloadable, non-registrable prepaid cards, among other products, argued that not only did the exemption require financial institutions to offer account registration, but it essentially obligated financial institutions to undertake a robust identity verification process with respect to each consumer. Otherwise, consumers could register their accounts with fake names and still be entitled to provisional credit. The Bureau's proposal, the commenter argued, would therefore extend an account registration requirement to accounts that are not currently required to perform such a process under FinCEN regulations, such as single-use or non-reloadable accounts. Such a change to industry practice, it argued, would necessitate major software and systems revisions at a great cost to financial institutions and their customers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to the Bureau's request for comment on whether it should require financial institutions to adopt a specific standard for collecting and verifying a consumer's identity, several industry commenters, including program managers and a trade association, argued that financial institutions should retain discretion with respect to which registration standard they adopt. They argued further that, whereas the FinCEN standard is effective and should be deemed sufficient for purposes of analyzing whether the financial institution had adequate consumer identification procedures in place, it should not be adopted as the required standard because the goals underlying the FinCEN customer identification requirements—preventing money laundering—differ from those of the proposed rule. Another industry commenter disagreed, arguing that the Bureau should require a single uniform standard for consumer identification and verification, and that the FinCEN standard should be the standard adopted. According to this commenter, the FinCEN standard has been effective in monitoring and preventing fraud for other transaction account types, and as such should prove effective for screening the identities of prepaid accountholders as well.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons discussed herein, the Bureau is finalizing § 1005.18(e)(3) and related commentary with several substantive revisions. Specifically, the Bureau has revised the limitation on a financial institution's requirement to provide limited liability and error resolution protections for unregistered accounts. Under the final rule, financial institutions must provide limited liability and error resolution protections for all accounts, regardless of whether the financial institution has completed its consumer identification and verification process with respect to the account. However, for accounts with respect to which the financial institution has not completed its identification and verification process (or for which the financial institution has no process), the financial institution may take up to the maximum length of time permitted under § 1005.11(c)(2)(i) or (3)(ii), as applicable, from receipt of a notice of error to investigate and determine whether an error occurred without provisionally crediting a consumer's account. The Bureau has made several changes to § 1005.18(e)(3) and its commentary to conform the proposed text to this revised formulation. In addition, it has added regulatory text and commentary, explained in more detail below, to address when a financial institution has completed its consumer identification and verification process, and to clarify that if, at the time the financial institution was required to provisionally credit an account, the financial institution had not yet completed its identification and verification process, the financial institution need not provisionally credit the account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>To further the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account users and to facilitate compliance with its provisions, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to finalize § 1005.18(e)(3) with a modified limitation on financial institutions' requirement to provide limited liability and error resolution for accounts that have not completed the consumer identification and verification process.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As explained in greater detail below, the Bureau is adopting § 1005.18(e)(3) revisions to clarify, in response to industry comments, that it is not requiring financial institutions to adopt a consumer identification and verification process for all prepaid accounts. Because it is concerned that this revision, on its own, would result in a class of un-registrable prepaid accounts that do not receive any limited liability or error resolution protections, however, the Bureau has also revised the scope of the exception in proposed § 1005.18(e)(3). Under the final rule, financial institutions must provide limited liability and error resolution protections for all accounts, regardless of whether the financial institution has completed its consumer identification and verification process with respect to the account. However, for accounts with respect to which the financial institution has not completed its identification and verification process (or for which the financial institution has no process), the financial institution may take up to the maximum length of time permitted under § 1005.11(c)(2)(i) or (3)(ii), as applicable, from receipt of a notice of error to investigate and determine whether an error occurred without provisionally crediting a consumer's account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with commenters that the proposed rule left open the question of whether financial institution had to adopt a consumer identification and verification process, or whether certain prepaid account types that do not offer or require an account registration process could continue to allow their customers to use the cards anonymously. The Bureau believes that there are legitimate reasons a consumer may opt for a particular account type—such as certain non-reloadable cards—that allows him or her to remain anonymous. Similarly, the Bureau is sensitive to industry's concerns that requiring financial institutions to adopt a consumer identification and verification regime where they previously did not have one would result in increased costs and, potentially, decreased consumer access to certain prepaid account products. Accordingly, the Bureau has declined to finalize a requirement that all prepaid accounts offer some sort of registration process.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>However, the Bureau is also concerned that financial institutions will choose not to offer registration or to delay completing registration as a way to avoid having to provide provisional credit. To that end, the Bureau is adopting new comment 18(e)-5, which provides an example of when a financial institution has not concluded the consumer identification and verification process with respect to a particular consumer: The example describes a financial institution that initiates the identification and verification process by collecting identifying information about a consumer and informing the consumer of the nature of the outstanding information, but, despite efforts to obtain additional information from the consumer, is unable to conclude the process because of conflicting information about the consumer. For the same reasons, the Bureau is finalizing a clarification in new comment 18(e)-5 stating that a financial institution may not delay completing its customer identification and verification process or refuse to verify a consumer's identity based on a consumer's assertion of an error. The Bureau believes that, as stated above, financial institutions have an incentive to encourage consumers to register their accounts to increase the functionality and thus the longevity of consumers' use of their accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>To clarify that it is not requiring financial institutions to adopt a consumer identification and verification process for prepaid accounts, the Bureau has finalized a provision that makes clear that financial institutions that do not offer a process by which a consumer's identifying information is collected and identity verified have not completed the consumer identification and verification process with respect to that account. As such, and as described in more specific detail below, with respect to such accounts that cannot be registered, the financial institution may avail itself of the limited exemption from the provisional credit requirements.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is concerned, however, that adding this clarification would expand the scope of the limited exemption in proposed § 1005.18(e)(3) in ways that would leave many vulnerable consumers unprotected. The Bureau agrees with the numerous consumer groups that emphasized the importance of limited liability and error resolution for prepaid consumers. In addition, while it is true that consumers may not generally use non-reloadable products as transaction account substitutes given that the funds will eventually be spent down in their entirety, the Bureau believes that extending protections to all broadly usable prepaid accounts is necessary to avoid consumer confusion as to what protections apply to similar accounts. Indeed, the Bureau notes that its testing showed that prepaid consumers currently expect prepaid products to be accompanied by protections for error or unauthorized use.<footnote ref="499">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report I at 10 (noting that “When asked what would happen if there were a fraudulent or inaccurate charge on their prepaid account, most participants believed that their prepaid card provider would credit the funds to their account. This belief seemed to be based almost exclusively on prior experiences with prepaid card providers and other financial institutions, rather than an understanding of any legal protections that may or may not exist.”).</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is concerned, therefore, that § 1005.18(e)(3), as revised by the clarification discussed above regarding un-registrable accounts, would leave such accounts without any limited liability and error resolution protections enforceable under Federal law during its entire existence, instead of only during the limited time before which a consumer registers his or her card. The Bureau did not intend to leave this entire class of prepaid accounts without such consumer protections. At the same time, as stated above, the Bureau acknowledges industry's concerns about the potential costs of having to extend provisional credit for accounts where the financial institution does not know and has not verified the consumer's identity.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>To balance these concerns, the Bureau has revised the proposed limitation on the requirement to provide limited liability and error resolution protections in proposed § 1005.18(e)(3). Rather than limit the requirement to provide any limited liability and error resolution protections, the final rule only limits the requirement to extend provisional credit for accounts with respect to which the financial institution has not completed its consumer identification and verification process. Thus, under new § 1005.18(e)(3)(i), with respect to accounts other than payroll card or government benefit accounts, a financial institution may take up to the maximum length of time permitted under § 1005.11(c)(2)(i) or (3)(ii), as applicable, from receipt of a notice of error to investigate and determine whether an error occurred without provisionally crediting a consumer's account if the financial institution has not completed its consumer identification and verification process with respect to that prepaid account. In effect, revised § 1005.18(e)(3)(i) now operates as an additional exception to § 1005.11(c)(2)(i), akin to existing § 1005.11(c)(2)(i)(A) and (B). As discussed above, the Bureau has added a new § 1005.11(c)(2)(i)(C) to make that clear. The Bureau is likewise adding a reference to new § 1005.11(c)(2)(i)(C) in § 1005.18(e)(3)(i) to clarify its operation.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes this revision is necessary to ensure that all prepaid account consumers have some recourse when they experience an unauthorized or erroneous transfer. While the Bureau considered whether to require limited liability and error resolution for unregistered accounts only when the accounts cannot be registered, the Bureau believes it is preferable to treat all unregistered accounts uniformly. Once again, the Bureau also believes this approach will help reduce consumer confusion as to what protections apply to similar accounts, especially in light of the Bureau's observations that prepaid consumers currently expect prepaid products to be protected against unauthorized use and other errors. Furthermore, the Bureau understands that, by revising the proposed limitation on the requirement to provide limited liability and error resolution as described herein, the Bureau is aligning § 1005.18(e)(3) with current industry practice. The Bureau believes the narrower limitation in revised § 1005.18(e)(3)(i) addresses the majority of industry's concerns. Again, the Bureau understands that most prepaid issuers already offer limited liability and error resolution protections with respect to most account types they offer.<footnote ref="500">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Study of Prepaid Account Agreements at 16 tbl.4; 2014 CFSI Scorecard at 12.</footnote>
             Indeed, many issuing bank commenters confirmed that they provide some limited liability and error resolution protections—but no provisional credit—for accounts that have not or cannot be registered. As such, the Bureau believes that the final rule generally reflects current industry practice and should not place a significant increased burden on financial institutions.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also revising the scope of the exclusion in § 1005.18(e)(3) beyond government benefit and payroll card accounts. As it noted in the proposal, the Bureau agrees with commenters that financial institutions providing prepaid accounts for purposes such as student financial aid disbursement or insurance payments should not be able to avail themselves of the exclusion in § 1005.18(e)(3), because consumer identifying information is typically collected and verified by the financial institution or its service provider prior to or as part of the acquisition process for those accounts.<footnote ref="501">79 FR 77102, 77185 (Dec. 23, 2014).</footnote>
             In the proposal, the Bureau expressly excluded government benefit and payroll card accounts from § 1005.18(e)(3) for a similar reason—that is, because it believed financial institutions often conduct the consumer identification and verification at the onset of the relationship with a government benefit or payroll card account customer.<footnote ref="502">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt; The Bureau also wanted to ensure that payroll card and government benefit accounts maintained the same level or limited liability and error resolution protections they had under existing Regulation E.</footnote>
             However, it did not expressly exclude from § 1005.18(e)(3) other types of accounts that similarly collect and verify consumer information prior to or during the acquisition process. The Bureau is now finalizing commentary that clarifies that such accounts cannot avail themselves of § 1005.18(e)(3).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Specifically, new comment 18(e)-6 states that a financial institution that collects and verifies consumer identifying information, or that obtains such information after it has been collected and verified by a third party, prior to or as part of the account acquisition process, is deemed to have completed its consumer identification and verification process with respect to that account. The reference to a third party collecting the verified information is intended to codify the Bureau's understanding, stated in the proposal, that collection and verification of information can be done by the financial institution directly, as well as by a service provider or agent of the institution. The comment provides an example of a financial institution that obtains from a university the identifying information necessary to disburse funds to students via the financial institution's prepaid account. Such a financial institution, the example states, would be deemed to have completed its consumer identification and verification process with respect to those students' accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Next, the Bureau believes that financial institutions should maintain discretion with respect to the type of consumer identification and verification process they adopt. As such, the Bureau is not finalizing a requirement that financial institutions adopt the FinCEN registration process, nor any other specific process for how to identify and verify an account, except that it is finalizing the guidance in proposed comment 18(e)-4 that consumer identifying information may include the consumer's full name, address, date of birth, and Social Security number, or other government-issued identification number. The Bureau notes, however, that on March 21, 2016, the Board, the FDIC, the NCUA, the OCC, and FinCEN issued interagency guidance to clarify that the FinCEN registration requirements apply to the cardholders of general purpose prepaid cards that have the features of an account and are issued by a bank.<footnote ref="503">Bd. of Governors of the Fed. Reserve Sys., Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp., Nat'l Credit Union Admin., Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Fin. Crimes Enforcement Network, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Interagency Guidance to Issuing Banks Applying Customer Identification Program Requirements to Holders of Prepaid Cards&lt;/em&gt; (Mar. 21, 2016), &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/srletters/sr1607.pdf.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
             Specifically, the guidance states that a general purpose prepaid card should be treated as an account if it provides a customer with the ability to reload funds or provides a consumer with access to credit or overdraft features.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Instead of adopting a single standard for consumer registration, the Bureau is adopting several provisions and commentary to clarify when, for purposes of § 1005.18(e)(3)(i), a financial institution can assert that it has not completed its consumer identification and verification process. Together, the new provisions are intended to make clear that a financial institution is only required to extend provisional credit for accounts where it actually knows and has verified the consumer's identity.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Specifically, pursuant to new § 1005.18(e)(3)(ii)(A), a financial institution has not completed its consumer identification and verification process where it has not concluded its consumer identification and verification process, provided the financial institution has disclosed to the consumer the risks of not registering the account using a notice that is substantially similar to the model notice contained in paragraph (c) of appendix A-7. Next, new § 1005.18(e)(3)(ii)(B) states that a financial institution has not completed the identification and verification process where it has concluded the process but could not verify the consumer's identity, again provided the financial institution has disclosed to the consumer the risks of not registering the account using a notice that is substantially similar to the model notice contained in paragraph (c) of appendix A-7. Although consumers will now receive limited liability and error resolution protections, except provisional credit, before their account is registered with the financial institution, the Bureau believes it is still important that consumers understand that their protections are more limited until they register their accounts. As such, the Bureau is still requiring financial institutions to provide a notice substantially similar to the model notice contained in paragraph (c) of appendix A-7 in order to qualify for § 1005.18(e)(3)(ii)(A) and (B).<footnote ref="504">The Bureau has revised the content of the notice to reflect the revisions to § 1005.18(e)(3) discussed herein. Those changes are discussed in the section-by-section analysis of appendix A-7 below.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, as stated earlier, new § 1005.18(e)(3)(ii)(C) sets forth that a financial institution has not completed the process where the financial institution does not have a consumer identification and registration process by which the consumer can register the prepaid account. To qualify for this provision, a financial institution need not provide the notice in paragraph (c) of appendix A-7 since the consumer cannot register his or her card to obtain provisional credit protections. For the same reason, the Bureau has revised proposed comment 18(e)-4. The proposed comment would have recounted that proposed § 1005.18(e)(3) provided that, in order to take advantage of the exception from the requirement to comply with the limited liability and error resolution requirements, a financial institution would have had to disclose to the consumer the risks of not registering a prepaid account using a notice substantially similar to paragraph (c) of appendix A-7. Since the requirement to provide the notice in paragraph (c) of appendix A-7 now appears in § 1005.18(e)(3)(ii)(A) and (B), but not in § 1005.18(e)(3)(ii)(C), the statement is no longer accurate, and as such has been removed.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to the requirement in proposed § 1005.18(e)(3) that, once an account is verified, financial institutions must provide limited liability and error resolution protections for pre-verification errors, the Bureau has considered the comments objecting to this aspect of the proposal, but is finalizing the general approach in new § 1005.18(e)(3)(iii). To conform the proposed provision to the revisions discussed above (narrowing the scope of the exclusion set forth in final § 1005.18(e)(3)(i)), new § 1005.18(e)(3)(iii) states that, if a consumer's account has been verified, a financial institution must comply with the provisions set forth in § 1005.11(c) in full with respect to any errors that satisfy the timing requirements of § 1005.11, or the modified timing requirements of § 1005.18(e), as applicable, including with respect to errors that occurred prior to verification. Thus, under the revised exclusion approach, once an account has been verified, financial institutions that take longer than 10 business days (or 20 business days, as applicable) to investigate a timely error report must provisionally credit the account with respect to an error, whether it occurred before or after the account was verified, in compliance with the applicable time limitations set forth in § 1005.11(c).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with industry commenters that it is unlikely that there will be many unauthorized transfers between the time a consumer acquires a prepaid account and the time the consumer is able to register the account.<footnote ref="505">Existing customer identification requirements, such as those imposed under the FinCEN Prepaid Access Rule, limit the functionality of most prepaid accounts prior to registration. Most GPR prepaid cards purchased online or by telephone require full customer identification and verification before a card is mailed to the consumer. For GPR cards purchased at retail, some financial institutions require the cardholder to call or go online to provide identifying information before the card can be used; if the verification process fails, the card functionality is limited to that of a gift card.</footnote>
             As such, the Bureau does not believe that a requirement to provide provisional credit protections for pre-registration transactions on a previously unregistered account should place a substantial burden on industry. The Bureau believes, however, that to the extent there are errors prior to verification, these could be significant—they could, for example, involve the initial amount the consumer loaded onto the account at acquisition, which could be a significant sum. Further, the Bureau notes that existing provisions in § 1005.11 already accommodate for potential fraudulent error claims asserted with respect to new accounts. Under both the proposed and final rule, new accounts would receive the benefit of the extended 20-business day investigation timeline set forth in § 1005.11(c)(3)(i).<footnote ref="506">The Bureau notes further that Regulation E permits financial institutions to ask for written confirmation of a consumer's oral error notification; if the institution does not receive the confirmation it seeks within 10 business days of an oral notice of error, the financial institution is not required to provide provisional credit with respect to that error claim. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; § 1005.11(c)(2)(i)(A).</footnote>
             Further, as set forth below, if, at the time the financial institution was supposed to provisionally credit the account, the financial institution had not yet completed its consumer identification and verification process, the financial institution is not required to extend provisional credit to that account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has made two other substantive revisions to address the timing requirements governing a financial institution's obligation to provide limited liability and error resolution rights once a consumer's account has been verified. First, the Bureau has removed a large portion of proposed comment 18(e)-4, which addressed the timelines for a consumer's timely report and a financial institution's timely investigation of an unauthorized transfer for accounts that were previously unverified. Because the final rule requires financial institutions to provide limited liability and error resolution rights to accounts regardless of whether or not they have been verified, the substance of that portion of the proposed comment is no longer applicable.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Second, as referenced above, the Bureau is adopting new § 1005.18(e)(3)(iii)(A) to address circumstances where a financial institution verifies an account <em data-original="E-03">after</em> a consumer reports an unauthorized transfer. Specifically, new § 1005.18(e)(3)(iii)(A) addresses a situation where, at the time the financial institution is required to provisionally credit the account, the financial institution has not yet completed its identification and verification process with respect to that account. New § 1005.18(e)(3)(iii)(A) states that, under that circumstance, the financial institution may take up to the maximum length of time permitted under § 1005.11(c)(2)(i) (45 days) or (3)(ii) (90 days) to investigate and determine whether an error occurred, without provisionally crediting the account. The Bureau believes this clarification is necessary, as without it, a financial institution could be retroactively liable for failing to extend provisional credit in a timely manner pursuant to § 1005.11(c)(1), even though, under new § 1005.18(e)(3)(i), it was not required to extend such credit yet since it had not completed its consumer identification and verification process.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition to the changes outlined above, the Bureau has made several minor revisions for clarity and conformity with revisions to other parts of the rule.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(e)(1) Modified Limitations on Liability Requirements</title>
      <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 909 addresses consumer liability and is implemented in § 1005.6. For accounts under Regulation E generally, including payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts, § 1005.6(a) provides that a consumer may be held liable for an unauthorized EFT resulting from the loss or theft of an access device only if the financial institution has provided certain required disclosures and other conditions are met.<footnote ref="484">The required disclosures for this purpose include a summary of the consumer's liability under § 1005.6, or under State law or other applicable law or agreement, for unauthorized EFTs; the telephone number and address of the person or office to be notified when the consumer believes an unauthorized transfer has been or may be made; and the financial institution's business days. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; §§ 1005.6(a) and 1005.7(b)(1) through (3).</footnote>
             Pursuant to § 1005.6(b)(1), if the consumer provides timely notice to the financial institution within two business days of learning of the loss or theft of the access device, the consumer's liability is the lesser of $50 or the amount of unauthorized transfers made before giving notice. Pursuant to § 1005.6, if timely notice is not given, the consumer's liability is the lesser of $500 or the sum of (1) the lesser of $50 or the amount of unauthorized transfers occurring within two business days of learning of the loss/theft and (2) the amount of unauthorized transfers that occur after two business days but before notice is given to the financial institution. Section 1005.6(b)(3) provides, in part, that a consumer must report an unauthorized EFT that appears on a periodic statement within 60 days of the financial institution's transmittal of the statement in order to avoid liability for subsequent transfers.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1005.18(c)(3)(i) provides that, for payroll card accounts following the periodic statement alternative in existing § 1005.18(b), the 60-day period in § 1005.6(b)(3) for reporting unauthorized transfers begins on the earlier of (1) the date the consumer electronically accesses his account under § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii), provided that the electronic history made available to the consumer reflects the transfer, or (2) the date the financial institution sends a written history of the consumer's account transactions requested by the consumer under § 1005.18(b)(1)(iii) in which the unauthorized transfer is first reflected. Alternatively, existing § 1005.18(c)(3)(ii) provides that a financial institution may comply with the requirements of § 1005.18(c)(3)(i) by limiting a consumer's liability for an unauthorized transfer as provided under § 1005.6(b)(3) for any transfer reported by the consumer within 120 days after the transfer was credited or debited to the consumer's account. The Bureau notes that this provision only modifies the 60-day period for consumers to report an unauthorized transfer and does not alter any other provision of § 1005.6.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to extend to all prepaid accounts the existing limited liability provisions of Regulation E with modifications to certain timing requirements for financial institutions following the periodic statement alternative in proposed § 1005.18(c)(1).<footnote ref="485">The Bureau proposed an additional modification in § 1005.18(e)(3), discussed below, to provide an exception to the requirement to provide limited liability protection when a financial institution had not completed collection of consumer identifying information and identity verification for a prepaid account, assuming notice of the risk of not registering the prepaid account had been provided to the consumer.</footnote>
             The text of proposed § 1005.18(e)(1) featured certain minor modifications for consistency but otherwise was unchanged from existing § 1005.18(c)(3).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Several consumer groups urged the Bureau to harmonize the liability limitations provided under Regulation E with those provided in Regulation Z for credit cards. Under Regulation Z § 1026.12(b), a cardholder's liability for an unauthorized transfer cannot exceed $50; the payment networks' dispute rules, which apply to network-branded prepaid cards, generally apply the Regulation Z limitations on liability. The commenters argued that it is confusing to have different liability limitation amounts potentially apply to a transaction on the same card. The commenters argued that the limitation amounts in Regulation E should be reduced to $50, in line with the limitation amounts in Regulation Z.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting § 1005.18(e)(1) as proposed, with minor revisions for clarity and consistency. To further the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account users and to facilitate compliance with its provisions, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA 904(c) to modify the timing requirements of EFTA 909(a). In addition, the Bureau has considered the modifications suggested by commenters, but declines to revise the liability limitations for prepaid accounts set forth in § 1005.18(e)(1). The dollar amount a consumer may be liable for an unauthorized transfer is specified by statute in EFTA section 909(a)(1) and (2). These limitations already apply to payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts. The Bureau is not persuaded that the process of identifying or resolving errors with respect to prepaid accounts is sufficiently different from the process applied with respect to payroll card accounts or government benefit accounts to warrant a separate limited liability regime. Further, the Bureau believes that adopting a different limited liability regime for prepaid accounts than the regime currently in existence accounts generally under Regulation E would require many financial institutions to change their practices, since, as the Bureau noted in the proposal, the vast majority of programs reviewed in the Bureau's Study of Prepaid Account Agreements already limit consumer liability in accordance with existing Regulation E provisions.<footnote ref="486">The Bureau found in its Study of Prepaid Account Agreements that 87.44 percent of agreements for GPR card programs and 64.28 percent of all other programs' agreements provided full limited liability protections to consumers. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Study of Prepaid Account Agreements at 16 tbl.4. Similarly, CFSI found in its 2014 study of the prepaid industry that all 18 programs in its review (representing an estimated 90 percent of the GPR card marketplace) had adopted the Payroll Card Rule's version of Regulation E error resolution and limited liability protections. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 2014 CFSI Scorecard at 12.</footnote>

      <title>32(c)(1) Exchange Rate</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.32(c)(1) set forth the approaches that a remittance transfer provider may use as the basis of an estimate of the exchange rate required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv). The final rule adopts the proposed rule as § 1005.32(c)(1), with modifications and additional commentary to address issues raised in comments.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The approach in proposed § 205.32(c)(1)(i) stated that for remittance transfers qualifying for the § 1005.32(b)(1)(ii) exception, the estimate must be based on the most recent exchange rate set by the recipient country's central bank and reported by a Federal Reserve Bank. Proposed comment 32(c)(1)(i)-1 clarified that if the exchange rate for a remittance transfer sent via international ACH that qualifies for the proposed § 205.32(b)(2) exception is set the following business day, the most recent exchange rate available for a transfer will be the exchange rate set for the day that the disclosure is provided, <em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the current business day's exchange rate. Consumer group commenters generally supported proposed § 205.32(c)(1)(i) and its commentary. Other commenters believed that the application of the proposed § 205.32(b)(2) exception should be broadened generally, as discussed above. Accordingly, proposed § 205.32(c)(1)(i) is adopted as proposed in renumbered § 1005.32(c)(1)(i). Comment 32(c)(1)(i)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed, but renumbered as comment 32(c)(1)-1 for organizational purposes.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The approach in proposed § 205.32(c)(1)(ii) provided that, for other transfers, the estimate must be based on the most recent publicly available wholesale exchange rate. Industry commenters argued that the wholesale interbank exchange rate would not be the rate actually applied to a consumer's remittance transfer, so using the wholesale exchange rate as an estimate would be misleading to consumers. For instance, basing an estimate on only the wholesale rate could consistently overestimate the amount of currency received by a recipient because the wholesale rate does not account for any spread applied to the rate for a sender's remittance transfer to a particular country. One commenter noted that estimates of exchange rates may be based on information from foreign exchange dealers as well as rates available in the marketplace.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Based on comments received and upon further analysis, the Bureau is adopting a revised basis for estimates in renumbered § 1005.32(c)(1)(ii) and its related commentary to address concerns regarding the proposed use of a wholesale exchange rate. Specifically, § 1005.32(c)(1)(ii) provides that, in disclosing the exchange rate as required under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), an estimate must be based on the most recent publicly available wholesale rate and, if applicable, the spread typically applied to such a rate by the remittance transfer provider or its correspondent to the wholesale rate for remittance transfers for a particular currency. The Bureau believes the revised subsection will result in an estimated exchange rate that better approximates the “retail” rate that will apply to a sender's remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 32(c)(1)-3 provides guidance on applying any spread to the estimate of an exchange rate based on the wholesale exchange rate. If a remittance transfer provider uses the most recent wholesale exchange rate as a basis for an estimate of an exchange rate, the exchange rate estimate must also reflect any spread that is typically applied to such a rate for remittance transfers for a particular currency. For example, assume a remittance transfer provider (or its correspondent) typically applies a spread, such as a fixed percentage, to a wholesale rate in order to determine the exchange rate offered to a sender for remittance transfers for a particular currency. If the provider must estimate an exchange rate for another remittance transfer for the same currency, the remittance transfer provider must estimate the exchange rate by applying the same spread (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> fixed percentage) to the most recent publicly available wholesale rate.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 32(c)(1)(ii)-1 provided that publicly available sources of information containing the most recent wholesale exchange rate for a currency include, for example, U.S. news services, such as Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal, and the New York Times; a recipient country's national news service; and a recipient country's central bank or other government agency. The Bureau did not receive any comments on this aspect of the proposal. One industry commenter, however, noted that for currency exchange rates not listed by a U.S. news service, remittance transfer providers could rely on the basis for estimates provided under proposed § 205.32(c)(1)(iii). Accordingly, proposed comment 32(c)(1)(ii)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed, but renumbered as comment 32(c)(1)-2 for organizational purposes.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters, however, stated that it was unclear which most recent publicly available wholesale exchange rate should apply because rates may fluctuate throughout the day and may be published on a Web site in addition to the rate that may be available in a news service publication. Based on these comments, the Bureau is adopting new comment 32(c)(1)-4 to provide guidance when an exchange rate for a currency is published or provided multiple times within a day. Specifically, comment 32(c)(1)-4 clarifies that if the exchange rate for a currency is published or provided multiple times throughout the day because the exchange rate fluctuates throughout the day, a remittance transfer provider may use any exchange rate available on that day for the purposes of determining the “most recent” exchange rate.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The approach in proposed § 205.32(c)(1)(iii) permitted the use of the most recent exchange rate offered by the person making funds available directly to the designated recipient as the basis for providing an estimate. However, in some instances the exchange rate used for a transfer may be set by other institutions, such as a foreign ACH counterpart or an intermediary institution in a transmittal route that is not a correspondent institution. For example, the first intermediary institution in the transmittal route that is in the recipient country may set the exchange rate and conduct the currency exchange before transmitting the remittance transfer to the recipient institution, which then makes the funds available to the designated recipient. Therefore, upon further consideration, proposed § 205.32(c)(1)(iii), in renumbered § 1005.32(c)(1)(iii), is revised to state that an estimate may be also based on the most recent exchange rate offered or used by the person in the transmittal route setting the exchange rate. The Bureau notes that § 1005.32(c)(1)(iii), as revised, addresses circumstances in which the local currency is infrequently traded or when wholesale exchange rates would not have been publicly available.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>32(c)(3) Other Fees</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.32(c)(3) provided that one of two approaches must be used to estimate the fees imposed by intermediary institutions in connection with an international wire transfer required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). Under the first approach, an estimate must be based on the remittance transfer provider's most recent transfer to an account at the designated recipient's institution. Under the second approach, an estimate must be based on the representations of the intermediary institutions along a representative route identified by the remittance transfer provider that the requested transfer could travel.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 32(c)(3)(ii)-1 clarified that a remittance transfer from a sender's account at an insured institution to the designated recipient's institution may take several routes, depending on the correspondent relationships each institution in the transmittal route has with other institutions. Proposed comment 32(c)(3)(ii)-1 further clarified that, in providing an estimate of the fees required to be disclosed under proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(vi) pursuant to the temporary exception, an insured institution may rely upon the representations of the institutions that act as intermediaries in any one of the potential transmittal routes that it reasonably believes a requested remittance transfer may travel.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters argued that insured institutions do not know what other fees an intermediary institution or the designated recipient's institution may charge. For example, a remittance transfer provider may not know the fees a receiving institution may charge its own customers for receiving a remittance transfer. Another commenter suggested that some small insured institutions may be unaware of the number of intermediary institutions involved in the transmittal route. Commenters also argued that it would be difficult to obtain sufficient information to be able to disclose any estimates, and that the requirement would impose operational burden on insured institutions, particularly on insured institutions that do not send international wire transfers frequently or are unable to obtain representations of intermediary institutions.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau believes that, consistent with the statute, it is appropriate to require remittance transfer providers to disclose fees imposed by intermediary institutions or the designated recipient's institution in order to determine the amount of currency received by the recipient. The Bureau further believes that the rule provides sufficient flexibility to facilitate compliance and that representative transmittal routes are readily determinable. In addition, the Bureau notes that a remittance transfer provider may be required to estimate other fees as required by § 1005.32(b)(1)(vi) in other circumstances. For example, if a remittance transfer provider estimates the exchange rate under the § 1005.32(b) permanent exception, a provider may be required to estimate other fees that are imposed as a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient. Therefore, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to provide additional clarification. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting a new § 1005.32(c)(3)(i) to provide that for other fees that are imposed as a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient, an estimate must be based on the estimated exchange rate provided in accordance with § 1005.32(c)(1), prior to any rounding of the estimated exchange rate. Furthermore, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 205.32(c)(3) with a technical revision in renumbered § 1005.32(c)(3)(ii). Comment 32(c)(3)(ii)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed, but is renumbered as comment 32(c)(3)-1 for organizational purposes.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>32(c)(4) Other Taxes Imposed in the Recipient Country</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.32(c)(4) stated that, in disclosing taxes imposed in the recipient country as required under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) that are a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient, an estimate must be based on the estimated exchange rate provided in accordance with § 1005.32(c)(1) and the estimated fees imposed by institutions that act as intermediaries in connection with an international wire transfer provided in accordance with § 1005.32(c)(3). Proposed comment 32(c)(4)-1 clarified that proposed § 205.32(c)(4) permits a provider to give an estimate only when the taxes imposed in a recipient country are a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient. In other contexts where taxes may be imposed, a remittance transfer provider can determine the exact amount, such as in the case of a tax of a specific amount. The Bureau did not receive comments on this aspect of the proposal. Accordingly, proposed § 205.32(c)(4) is adopted in renumbered § 1005.32(c)(4) with revisions for consistency with amended §§ 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) and 1005.32(c)(3). The Bureau is revising comment 32(c)(4)-1 to clarify that a remittance transfer provider can determine the exact amount of other taxes that are a percentage of the amount transferred if the provider can determine the exchange rate and the exact amount of other fees imposed on the remittance transfer.

      <title>Section 1005.3 Coverage</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Currently, § 1005.3(a) states that Regulation E generally applies to financial institutions. Section 1005.3(a) is revised to state that the requirements of subpart B apply to remittance transfer providers. The revision reflects the fact that the scope of the Dodd-Frank Act's remittance transfer provisions is not limited to financial institutions. Specifically, EFTA section 919(g)(3) defines a remittance transfer provider as “ <em data-original="E-03">any person</em> that provides remittance transfers for a consumer in the normal course of its business, whether or not the consumer holds an account with such person” (emphasis added). Thus, subpart B applies to non-financial institutions, such as non-bank money transmitters, that send remittance transfers. This revision is adopted as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1005.2 Definitions</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.2 generally sets forth the definitions that apply to Regulation E. One commenter suggested that the Bureau clarify the applicability of the definitions contained in § 1005.2, which have been placed in a new subpart A, to the remittance provisions in subpart B. Section 1005.2 is prefaced with: “For purposes of this part. * * *.” “This part” refers to the entirety of part 1005, including all subparts. Therefore, except as modified or limited by subpart B (which modifications or limitations apply only to subpart B), the definitions in § 1005.2 apply to all of Regulation E, including subpart B. The final rule adopts comment 30-1 to clarify the applicability of the definitions contained in § 1005.2 to subpart B. The final rule also amends § 1005.2 to cross reference subpart B to make clear that the definitions in § 1005.2 apply to subpart B unless otherwise provided in subpart B.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>33(a)(1)(iv) Failure To Make Funds Available by Date of Availability</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv) generally defined an “error” to include a remittance transfer provider's failure to make funds in connection with a remittance transfer available to the designated recipient by the date of availability stated on the receipt or combined disclosure, subject to two specified exceptions, discussed below. The Board proposed comment 33(a)-4 to provide examples of the circumstances that would have been considered errors under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv). These circumstances included: (i) The late delivery of a remittance transfer after the stated date of availability or non-delivery of the transfer; (ii) the deposit of a remittance transfer to the wrong account; (iii) retention of the transferred funds by a recipient agent or institution after the stated date of availability, rather than making the funds available to the designated recipient; and (iv) the fraudulent pick-up of a remittance transfer in a foreign country by a person other than the person identified by the sender as the designated recipient of the transfer. Fraudulent pick-up, however, did not include circumstances in which a designated recipient picks up a remittance transfer from the provider's agent as authorized, but subsequently the funds are stolen from the recipient.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters objected to the inclusion of fraudulent pick-up as an error. These commenters suggested that the remittance transfer provider should not be responsible for fraud that results in the pick-up of a remittance transfer by a person other than the designated recipient where the provider is unlikely to know or have control over all the intermediary institutions involved in the transfer or the final institution that will make the funds available to the designated recipient. Other commenters, including the OCC, suggested that this error might result in “friendly fraud” where a sender claims the amount was not an authorized pick-up when the pick-up was actually legitimate. The OCC was also concerned that the exposure to remittance transfer providers for this error may be aggravated in situations involving large dollar remittances and because of the long period of time that a sender could assert this error.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter noted that while there may be certain instances when fraudulent pick-up should be considered an error, there may be other circumstances when fraudulent pick-up should not be an error. In particular, this commenter suggested that where the name of the person picking up the funds does not match the name of the designated recipient set forth in the receipt, the sender should be able to assert an error. However, if an individual presents fake identification in the name of the designated recipient, this commenter stated that this fraudulent pick-up is outside of the remittance transfer provider's control and therefore, should not be considered an error. Industry commenters also believed that a remittance transfer provider should not be liable for a fraudulent pick-up when a provider and its agent has complied with fraud and risk management policies and procedures.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As the Board noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, treating fraudulent pick-up of a remittance transfer as an error is consistent with the scope of unauthorized EFTs under § 1005.2(m), which includes unauthorized EFTs initiated through fraudulent means. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 2(m)-3. Although identity theft can present a challenge to remittance transfer providers, financial institutions face similar challenges with respect to unauthorized EFTs and bear most of the risk. Moreover, similar to remittance transfers, the entity in the best position to verify the identity of the person initiating the EFT (for example, the merchant at a store who initiates an EFT using a debit card) may not be known or controlled by the financial institution, though such entities may have agreed to abide by system rules (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> payment card network rules, ACH system rules). However, under current laws governing EFTs, whether the financial institution knows or has control over that entity (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> a merchant) does not affect whether an EFT could be an unauthorized EFT. Similarly, the Bureau believes that whether a fraudulent pick-up should be considered an error should not be affected by the relationship between the remittance transfer provider and the entity distributing the remittance transfer to the designated recipient.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, the Bureau agrees with the Board's reasoning in the May 2011 Proposed Rule that it is appropriate to treat these circumstances as errors because the remittance transfer provider, rather than the sender, is in the best position to ensure that a remittance transfer is picked up only by the person designated by the sender. For example, in some models, remittance transfer providers could require or contract with the entity distributing the funds, if it is not the remittance transfer provider itself, to request and examine identification from the person picking up the funds. The Bureau believes that including fraudulent pick-up as an error would better align the remittance transfer provider's incentives to prevent this occurrence with the interests of the sender.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter suggested that a sender be required to inform the remittance transfer provider if the confirmation number or receipt is lost or stolen. For some remittance transfer providers, a designated recipient is required to give the confirmation number, which is generally printed on the receipt, in order to obtain access to the funds in a remittance transfer. The commenter suggested that this approach would be similar to the approach taken with respect to a lost or stolen access device in § 1005.6(b) with respect to unauthorized EFTs, where a consumer's liability for unauthorized EFTs is dependent on how quickly the consumer reports the lost or stolen access device to the account-holder financial institution.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes, however, the risk for a lost or stolen confirmation number is not the same as for a lost or stolen access device for EFTs. A lost or stolen access device could potentially be used to initiate an EFT by a person who is not the account holder immediately without an accomplice and without identification matching the name associated with the access device. By contrast, where a confirmation number given to the sender is lost or stolen, an unauthorized person who gains access to the number would not be able to take advantage of it unless he or she were located or had an accomplice in the recipient country. Furthermore, because access to funds sent by a remittance transfer provider is often limited to those with identification matching the designated recipient on the receipt, an unauthorized person who gains access to a lost or stolen confirmation number may be deterred from taking advantage of it. Consequently, the Bureau does not believe that a sender's liability should depend on whether he or she reports a confirmation number or receipt as lost or stolen.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Moreover, under § 1005.6(b), a consumer's liability for unauthorized EFTs is dependent on how quickly the consumer reports the lost or stolen access device because the speed with which a consumer reports the lost or stolen access device may be critical to preventing further unauthorized EFTs and further losses, and the possibility of increased liability provides incentives for a consumer to report quickly. In contrast, a lost or stolen confirmation number would not result in losses other than the specific remittance transfer in question. Therefore, the Bureau also does not believe that a sender's liability should depend on how quickly a sender reports a lost or stolen confirmation number.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting comment 33(a)-4, renumbered as comment 33(a)-5, generally as proposed. Specifically, the Bureau is including a statement to clarify that if only a portion of the funds were made available by the disclosed date of availability, then § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) does not apply, but § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) may apply instead.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Exceptions to the Failure To Make Funds Available by Date of Availability</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As noted above, the proposed rule provided two exceptions to the definition of “error” in proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv). Under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(A), the failure to make funds from a remittance transfer available by the stated date of availability did not constitute an error if the failure resulted from circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control. Under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(B), the failure to make funds from a remittance transfer available on the stated date of availability did not constitute an error if it was caused by the sender providing incorrect information in connection with the remittance transfer to the provider, so long as the provider gives the sender the opportunity to correct the information and resend the transfer at no additional cost. The Bureau adopts one of these two exceptions with changes to respond to commenters' concerns, as discussed below. The other exception has been moved to the remedies section under § 1005.33(c)(2) for the reasons discussed below. The Bureau is also adopting two additional exceptions to the definition of “error” in proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv).</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Exception for Extraordinary Circumstances Outside of the Remittance Transfer Provider's Control</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(A) provided that the failure to make funds from a remittance transfer available by the stated date of availability did not constitute an error if the failure resulted from circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control. Proposed comment 33(a)-5 clarified that the exception was limited to circumstances that are generally referred to under contract law as force majeure, or uncontrollable or extraordinary circumstances that cannot be reasonably anticipated by the remittance transfer provider and that prevent the provider from delivering a remittance transfer, such as war, civil unrest, or a natural disaster. The proposed comment also provided that the exception for circumstances beyond a provider's control covered government actions or other restrictions that occur after the transfer has been sent but that could not have been reasonably anticipated by the remittance transfer provider, such as the imposition of foreign currency controls or the garnishment or attachment of funds.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters stated that the proposed comment limiting the circumstances beyond the provider's control to instances of force majeure or to other uncontrollable or extraordinary circumstances was too narrow. Several industry commenters recommended that the exception should be more broadly interpreted to exclude errors caused by acts of a third party beyond a remittance transfer provider's control. Consumer group commenters believed the approach in the proposed rule was a reasonable limitation and recommended that the commentary specifically state that mistakes by a recipient institution do not fall under the exception to the error to deliver funds by the date of delivery. Other consumer group commenters suggested that the final rule limit the circumstances even further to only include acts of war or terrorism or natural disaster.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau does not believe that whether a particular circumstance constitutes an error or not should necessarily depend on whether a provider is at fault. Even if the error is caused by a third party beyond the remittance transfer provider's control, the Bureau believes that the remittance transfer provider is often in a better position to identify and recover the loss from the third party than a sender, especially when there are multiple intermediary institutions involved in a transfer. Accordingly, the Bureau believes that with respect to third-party errors, the circumstances in proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(A) should include only a narrow category of third-party errors caused by uncontrollable or extraordinary circumstances that cannot be reasonably anticipated by the remittance transfer provider and that prevent the provider from delivering a remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, the Bureau believes the proposed comment is appropriately narrow in interpreting the limited set of circumstances for which the failure to make funds available by the disclosed date of delivery should not be an error. Therefore, proposed comment 33(a)-5 is adopted substantially as proposed in comment 33(a)-6. The Bureau is adopting proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(A) generally as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(A). However, the Bureau is adding language to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(A) to more accurately reflect the descriptions of the types of circumstances listed in comment 33(a)-6. Specifically, § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(A) provides that a failure to make funds available by the disclosed date of delivery is not an error if the failure resulted from extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Exception for Sender Providing Incorrect or Insufficient Information</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(B) provided that the failure to make funds from a remittance transfer available on the stated date of availability did not constitute an error if it was caused by the sender providing incorrect information in connection with the remittance transfer to the provider, so long as the provider gives the sender the opportunity to correct the information and resend the transfer at no additional cost. Proposed comment 33(a)-6 clarified that if the failure to make funds from a transfer available by the stated date of availability occurred due to the <em data-original="E-03">provider's</em> miscommunication of information necessary for the designated recipient to pick up the transfer, such as providing the incorrect location where the transfer may be picked up or providing the wrong confirmation number or code for the transfer, such failure would have been treated as an error under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters objected to the requirement that the remittance transfer provider absorb the costs of amending and resending a transfer when the sender is at fault. These commenters noted that modifying transfers can be expensive and that the proposed rule would, in effect, require the remittance transfer provider and other senders, through higher fees, to bear the responsibility for a sender's mistake.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with commenters that a sender's mistake should not obligate a remittance transfer provider to bear all the costs for resending the remittance transfer. However, the Bureau believes that while the remittance transfer provider should not bear all the costs in these circumstances, the failure should still be considered an error such that the error resolution procedures apply. Therefore, the Bureau is moving the concept in proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(B) to a new § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), and proposed comment 33(a)-6 to renumbered comment 33(c)-2, as discussed further below.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Additional Exceptions</title>
        <analysisParagraph>In the final rule, the Bureau is adding two additional exceptions to the definition of “error” in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) based on a consideration of comments received. New § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(B) provides that delays in making funds available to a designated recipient that are related to a provider's fraud screening procedures or in accordance with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), 31 U.S.C. 5311 <em data-original="E-03">et seq.,</em> Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) requirements, or similar laws or requirements would not constitute an error. Several industry commenters and the OCC noted that for fraud screening, BSA, or OFAC purposes, a remittance transfer provider may have further communications with the sender to ensure the legitimacy or the legality of a remittance transfer. This, in turn, may cause delays in making the funds available to a designated recipient. The Bureau believes it is appropriate to exclude these situations from the definition of “error” in order to encourage remittance transfer providers to continue to engage in activities that benefit the safety of the transfer system as a whole. The Bureau understands that under current procedures, these types of delays are generally infrequent, relative to the number of remittance transfers typically conducted by remittance transfer providers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adopting a new § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C) in response to industry commenters' and the OCC's concerns about “friendly fraud.” Consequently, consistent with the definition of “unauthorized electronic fund transfer” under § 1005.2(m), and as suggested by the OCC to address its concerns regarding the error of fraudulent pick-up, § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C) provides an exception to the “error” definition for remittance transfers made with fraudulent intent by the sender or any person in concert with the sender. Therefore, if a sender is involved in a scheme to defraud the remittance transfer provider, for example, by fraudulently claiming that the designated recipient did not pick up funds that the designated recipient in fact did pick up, such action would not be considered an “error” under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>36(a)(2) Timing of Disclosures for Subsequent Preauthorized Remittance Transfers</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The February Final Rule contains disclosure provisions specific to subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> all preauthorized remittance transfers after the first in the series of transfers). Section 1005.36(a)(2)(i) of the February Final Rule requires that a remittance transfer provider also mail or deliver a pre-payment disclosure to the sender for each subsequent transfer and requires the disclosure to be mailed or delivered within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of each subsequent transfer. This provision is in lieu of the general timing rule, which would have required that a pre-payment disclosure for each transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers be given at the time of the initial request (and thus a sender would receive a disclosure for every preauthorized transfer when requesting the entire series). <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(e)(1). Section 1005.36(a)(2)(ii) in the February Final Rule requires a receipt to be mailed or delivered no later than one business day after the transfer or, for account-based transactions, on or with the next regularly scheduled periodic statement or within 30 days after payment is made for the remittance transfer if a periodic statement is not provided.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In the February Proposal, the Bureau sought comment on an alternative to the requirement in the February Final Rule that a pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfer be provided within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of transfer: Whether the pre-payment disclosure requirement for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers should be eliminated.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters generally favored eliminating the requirement for providing pre-payment disclosures for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers for many of the same reasons these commenters disfavored a rule requiring accurate pre-payment disclosures for other transfers scheduled before the date of transfer. These commenters argued that a pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent transfer would be unnecessary, potentially confusing to senders, and burdensome to providers. For example, one commenter argued that senders schedule preauthorized remittance transfers for purposes of convenience and that senders typically do not comparison shop to complete each recurring transfer. The same commenter expressed concern that the requirement of an additional pre-payment disclosure might cause some providers to no longer allow consumers to schedule transfers before the date of transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In contrast, one consumer group commenter supported requiring pre-payment disclosures to be provided to senders ten days before each subsequent transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers (and stated that if estimates were permitted for disclosures related to such transfers, that those disclosures contain current estimates). This commenter urged that the Bureau maintain the requirement in the February Final Rule for pre-payment disclosures so that senders have additional information regarding the details of each preauthorized remittance transfer prior to such transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Upon consideration of these comments and to facilitate compliance, the Bureau is eliminating the requirement to provide a pre-payment disclosure within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer. Thus, the Bureau is eliminating what was § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) in the February Final Rule. The Bureau is doing so for several reasons. The Bureau is concerned that the requirement in the February Final Rule—a pre-payment disclosure sent a reasonable time prior to each subsequent remittance transfer—might provide senders only a limited amount of information because pre-payment disclosures for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers sent five or more business days before the date of transfer could contain estimates, pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2). In addition, in some scenarios, this could create a potential for confusing and overlapping disclosures and receipts.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Conversely, the Bureau believes that if it mandated that pre-payment disclosures be sent less than five business days before a subsequent transfer such that the disclosures could not contain estimates under § 1005.32(b)(2), the disclosure would be of little use to the sender for the upcoming transfer as it could be received too close to (or after) the cancellation deadline. Separately, confusion for senders could exist in some circumstances where preauthorized remittance transfers are scheduled relatively close together or receipts are provided with periodic statements. In these cases, a sender might receive a post-transfer receipt from a prior preauthorized remittance transfer close in time to a pre-payment disclosure for the next transfer. These documents, with potentially differing exchange rates and other figures, might confuse senders unnecessarily.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also believes that eliminating the requirement for pre-payment disclosures for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers is appropriate in part because senders will receive some relevant information in receipts for prior preauthorized remittance transfers. The final rule requires that for any preauthorized remittance transfer, the remittance transfer provider must provide a sender a receipt with accurate information (except to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32(a) or (b)(1)). A receipt from the prior transfer with accurate amounts may provide the sender with information that could educate the sender not only about the prior transfer but also about the provider's practices generally, which may help the sender judge whether to continue with the provider for future preauthorized remittance transfers. The Bureau believes a sender can learn about a remittance transfer provider's exchange rate practices from what the designated recipient actually received from the prior transfers in the series. In addition, the receipt provided for the initial transfer in a series provides information about the fees and taxes that will apply to all subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers, unless a change necessitates a new disclosure, as discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Although the Bureau is eliminating the requirement that a remittance transfer provider provide a pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the Bureau remains concerned that previously disclosed figures (other than the estimates themselves) could change, rendering the figures disclosed in the pre-payment disclosure provided for the initial transfer inaccurate as applied to the subsequent transfers.<footnote ref="18">Although changes in terms trigger notice requirements in some instances under Regulation E (&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; 12 CFR 1005.10), that provision does not apply to remittance transfers that are not electronic fund transfers.</footnote>
             Comment 31(f)-1 to the February Final Rule explains that under the general timing and accuracy rules in subpart B of Regulation E, providers must give senders new pre-payment disclosures before accepting payment if previously provided pre-payment disclosures are inaccurate. However, since a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or, as discussed below, .36(a)(2)(i), may serve as a disclosure with respect to multiple subsequent preauthorized transfers, the temporal elements disclosed on those receipts would only be accurate with respect to the transfer to occur after the receipt is provided.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Thus, the Bureau is adopting a new § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) to specifically address certain changes in terms related to subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. Section 1005.36(a)(2)(i) states that if any of the information on the most recent receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or § 1005.36(a)(2)(i), other than the temporal disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) (Date Available) and (b)(2)(vii) (Transfer Date), is no longer accurate with respect to a subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer for reasons other than as permitted by § 1005.32, then the remittance transfer provider must provide an updated receipt meeting the requirements described in § 1005.31(b)(2) to the sender. The provider must mail or deliver this receipt to the sender within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of the next subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer. Such receipt must clearly and conspicuously indicate that it contains updated disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 36(a)(2)-1 clarifies when the disclosure required by § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) must be provided. Specifically, it states that when a sender schedules a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the provider is generally not required to provide a pre-payment disclosure prior to the date of each subsequent transfer. However, § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) requires the provider to provide a pre-payment disclosure and receipt for the first in the series of preauthorized remittance transfers in accordance with the timing requirements set forth in § 1005.31(e). <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.36(a)(1)(i). While certain information in those disclosures is expressly permitted to be estimated (<em data-original="E-03">see</em> § 1005.32(b)(2)(i) through (iii)), other information is not permitted to be estimated, or is limited in how it may be estimated. When any of the information on the most recent receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i), other than the temporal disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) (the Date Available) and (b)(2)(vii) (the Transfer Date), is no longer accurate with respect to a subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer for reasons other than as permitted by § 1005.32, the provider must provide, within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of the next preauthorized remittance transfer, a receipt that complies with § 1005.31(b)(2) and which discloses, among the other disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(2), the changed terms.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For example, if the provider discloses in the pre-payment disclosure for the first in the series of preauthorized remittance transfers that its fee for each remittance transfer is $20 and, after six preauthorized remittance transfers, the provider increases its fee to $30 (to the extent permitted by contract law), the provider must provide the sender a receipt that complies with §§ 1005.31(b)(2) and 1005.36(b)(2) within a reasonable time prior to the seventh transfer. Barring a further change, this receipt will apply to transfers after the seventh transfer. Or, if, after the sixth transfer, a tax increases from 1.5% of the amount that will be transferred to the designated recipient to 2.0% of the amount that will be transferred to the designated recipient, the provider must provide the sender a receipt that complies with §§ 1005.31(b)(2) and 1005.36(b)(2) within a reasonable time prior to the seventh transfer. In contrast, § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) does not require an updated receipt where an exchange rate, estimated as permitted in § 1005.32, changes.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 36(a)(2)-2 explains that in order to clearly and conspicuously indicate that the provider's fee has changed as required by § 1005.36(a)(2)(i), the provider could, for example, state on the receipt: “Transfer Fees (UPDATED) * * * $30.” To the extent that other figures on the receipt must be revised because of the new fee, the receipt should similarly indicate that those figures are updated.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In the February Proposal, the Bureau also solicited comment on whether it should provide a safe harbor interpreting the “within a reasonable time” standard for providing a pre-payment disclosure for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. Although such a disclosure is no longer required, the same “within a reasonable time” requirement now applies to receipts required by § 1005.36(a)(2)(i). The bulk of the comments received on how to interpret “within a reasonable time” concerned industry commenters' concerns regarding the requirement in the February Final Rule that any required pre-payment disclosures reflect the actual exchange rates that will apply to preauthorized remittance transfers. Industry commenters stated that it would be difficult to disclose accurate exchange rates ten days before the date of a remittance transfer. Insofar as § 1005.32(b)(2) allows estimates in disclosures provided for remittance transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer, this concern should be alleviated. Industry commenters generally stated that if estimates were permitted, ten days was a reasonable period of time.
          </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 36(a)(2)-3 explains if a receipt required by § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) (or, as discussed below, required by § 1005.36(d)(1)) is mailed, the receipt would be considered to be received by the sender five business days after it is posted in the mail. If hand delivered or provided electronically, the receipt would be considered to be received by the sender at the time of delivery. Thus, if the provider mails the receipt not later than ten business days before the scheduled date of the transfer, or hand or electronically delivers the receipt not later than five business days before the scheduled date of the transfer, the provider would be deemed to have mailed or delivered the receipt within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of the subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau is modifying § 1005.36(a)(2)(ii) from the February Final Rule, which requires receipts for all subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. As adopted, § 1005.36(a)(2)(ii) explains when receipts must be sent. It states that unless a receipt was provided in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) that contained no estimates pursuant to § 1005.32, the remittance transfer provider must mail or deliver to the sender a receipt described in § 1005.31(b)(2) no later than one business day after the date of the transfer. If the remittance transfer involves the transfer of funds from the sender's account held by the provider, the receipt required by this paragraph may be provided on or with the next periodic statement for that account, or within 30 days after the date of the transfer if a periodic statement is not provided.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau is adopting an additional disclosure requirement for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers as § 1005.36(a)(2)(iii), which requires providers to provide the disclosures required by § 1005.36(d) in accordance with the timing requirements of that section. Section 1005.36(d) is discussed in more detail below.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>31(a)(2) Written and Electronic Disclosures</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(a)(2) set forth the requirements for written and electronic disclosures under subpart B. Proposed § 205.31(a)(2) stated that disclosures required by subpart B generally must be provided to the sender in writing. However, the proposal permitted a pre-payment disclosure under proposed § 205.31(b)(1) to be provided to the sender in electronic form, if the sender electronically requests the remittance transfer provider to send a remittance transfer. In such a case, proposed comment 31(a)(2)-1 explained that a pre-payment disclosure could be provided to the sender without complying with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act. The proposed comment also clarified that if a sender electronically requests the remittance transfer provider to send a remittance transfer, the receipt required by proposed § 205.31(b)(2) also could be provided to the sender in electronic form, but only if the provider complies with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters and one industry commenter supported the requirement that disclosures must be provided in writing and the exception for pre-payment disclosures to be provided electronically if a sender initiates the transaction electronically. Some industry commenters, however, argued that the pre-payment disclosures should be permitted to be provided on a computer screen or orally, if a transaction is conducted in person. One industry commenter suggested that pre-payment disclosures could be provided on a screen similar to those used at a point-of-sale to authorize payment card transactions. Industry commenters asked the Bureau to also permit the combined disclosures to be disclosed electronically without obtaining E-Sign consent.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the proposal, the statute generally requires disclosures under subpart B to be in writing, <em data-original="E-03">see</em> EFTA sections 919(a)(2), (a)(5)(C), and (d)(1)(B)(iv), and generally requires compliance with E-Sign in conjunction with electronic transactions, <em data-original="E-03">see</em> EFTA section 919(a)(3)(B). Because EFTA section 919(a)(5)(D) specifically allows the Bureau to waive E-Sign requirements only with regard to pre-payment disclosures where the sender initiates the transaction electronically and the provider provides the pre-payment disclosure in an electronic form that the consumer may keep, the Bureau believes that provision of combined disclosures and receipts must be in compliance with E-Sign as specified in 919(a)(3)(B). Similarly, the Bureau believes that pre-payment disclosures provided when a sender conducts a transaction in person must be provided in writing. Thus, the Bureau believes it would not be consistent with the statute to permit the pre-payment disclosure or the combined disclosure to be provided orally or to be shown to a sender on a computer screen at the point-of-sale prior to payment for point-of-sale transactions.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter argued that remittance transfer providers that are broker-dealers should be permitted to comply with guidance published by the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding electronic disclosures, rather than being required to obtain E-Sign consent. To the extent that transfers made in connection with securities transactions have been exempted from the rule, as discussed above in § 1005.30(e)(2)(ii), the commenter's concerns should be mitigated.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Therefore, the Bureau is adopting as proposed the provisions regarding written and electronic disclosures in § 1005.31(a)(2) of the final rule. The Bureau is also adopting comment 31(a)(2)-1 in the final rule substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(a)(2)-2 clarified that written disclosures may be provided on any size paper, as long as the disclosures are clear and conspicuous. The proposed comment stated that disclosures may be provided, for example, on a register receipt or on an 8.5 inch by 11 inch sheet of paper, consistent with current practices in the industry. The Bureau did not receive comment regarding proposed comment 31(a)(2)-2, and it is finalized as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(a)(2) also provided that the written and electronic disclosures required by subpart B must be made in a retainable form. In the proposal, the Board requested comment on how the requirement to provide electronic disclosures in a retainable form could be applied to transactions conducted via mobile application or text message. Consumer group commenters stated that disclosures sent through text were not likely made in a form the sender can keep because mobile phone carriers regularly delete text message data or limit the size of texts. These commenters argued that the Bureau should not permit disclosures to be provided solely through mobile application or text message until technology allowed them to be retainable. These commenters stated that receipts should not be provided through mobile application or text message because they would not provide a sender with meaningful, consumer-friendly disclosures in a retainable form. Instead, consumer group commenters suggested that the Bureau should permit receipts for mobile telephone transactions to be provided through other electronic forms or written mailed receipts.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters, in contrast, argued that the final rule should provide sufficient flexibility to accommodate disclosures relating to remittance transfers sent via mobile application or text message. Some commenters stated that the Bureau should permit remittance transfer providers to provide disclosures through the provider's preferred method, including by mobile application or text message, so long as the sender is capable of receiving disclosures through that method. Another industry commenter argued that the retainability requirement should only apply to the receipt and not to the pre-payment disclosures for transactions conducted via mobile application or text message. One industry commenter stated that for a remittance transfer initiated by mobile telephone, the Bureau should allow disclosures to be provided on the telephone if accompanied by the delivery of a retainable version of the same disclosure through the Internet, since mobile telephones typically do not allow for printing.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed below regarding § 1005.31(a)(5), the Bureau is permitting the pre-payment disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(1) to be disclosed orally or via mobile application or text message if the transaction is conducted entirely by telephone via mobile application or text message. The Bureau understands that given current technical limitations, in many cases, disclosures provided via mobile application or text message could not be provided in a retainable form or in a manner that satisfies formatting requirements. The Bureau notes, however, that the statute expressly permits the pre-payment disclosures to be provided orally for transfers conducted entirely by telephone. Thus, if a transaction is conducted entirely by telephone via mobile application or text message, a provider may give the pre-payment disclosure orally. Because oral disclosures are not retainable, the Bureau does not believe senders would be less protected by receiving pre-payment disclosures via mobile application or text message that are also not retainable. Moreover, in some cases, disclosures provided via mobile application or text message may be better than oral disclosures. For example, a disclosure provided by text message stored in a mobile telephone could be viewed by the sender for a period of time after the transaction is complete or forwarded to an email or other savable file. Therefore, § 1005.31(a)(2) provides that written and electronic disclosures required by subpart B generally must be made in a retainable form. However, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under ETFA sections 904(a) and (c) to provide in the final rule that for transfers conducted entirely by telephone via mobile application or text message, the pre-payment disclosures may be provided via mobile application or text message in accordance with § 1005.31(a)(5) and need not be retainable. The Bureau is also adding a new comment 31(a)(2)-4 to clarify that disclosures provided electronically to a mobile telephone that are not provided via mobile application or text message must be retainable. For example, disclosures provided via email must be retainable, even if a sender accesses them by mobile telephone.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(a)(2)-3 clarified that a remittance transfer provider may satisfy the requirement to provide electronic disclosures in a retainable form if it provides an online disclosure in a format that is capable of being printed. The proposed comment clarified that electronic disclosures cannot be provided through a hyperlink or in another manner by which the sender can bypass the disclosure. A provider is not required to confirm that the sender has read the electronic disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters generally supported these retainability requirements. Industry commenters suggested that the Bureau revise or clarify the rules regarding the provision of electronic disclosures. Industry commenters stated that the Bureau should permit a remittance transfer provider to provide disclosures by sending a hyperlink to the sender or to permit the provider to make a disclosure available on its Web site where disclosures can be viewed. One commenter suggested that the Bureau should clarify that disclosures are retainable as long as they may be saved or stored on a computer. This commenter stated that a disclosure would be retainable if, for example, a sender could save a screen shot or download a file that could be saved.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes proposed comment 31(a)(2)-3 appropriately addressed how disclosures may be provided in a retainable format when disclosed electronically. The proposed comment sets forth general principles for providing electronic disclosures that can be applied to various scenarios in which electronic disclosures are provided. For example, a provider could determine that a screen shot or downloadable file complies with the retainability requirement if those formats are also capable of being printed. The proposed comment is also consistent with other of the Bureau's electronic disclosure provisions that ensure that senders are provided with disclosures, rather than permitting disclosures to simply be made available to them.<footnote ref="75">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; for example, § 1005.20(c)(2) and § 1026.5a(a)(2).</footnote>

      <title>31(a)(2) Written and Electronic Disclosures</title>
      <analysisParagraph>EFTA, as implemented by the Remittance Rule, generally requires remittance transfer providers to provide disclosures required by subpart B of Regulation E to the sender in writing. § 1005.31(a)(2). But neither the statute nor the Remittance Rule specifies what qualifies as a writing (except to state that written disclosures may be provided on any size of paper, as long as the disclosures are clear and conspicuous, <em data-original="E-03">see</em> comment 31(a)(2)-2). The Bureau proposed comment 31(a)(2)-5, which would have explained that disclosures provided pursuant to § 1005.31 or § 1005.36 by facsimile transmission (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> fax) are written disclosures for purposes of providing disclosures in writing pursuant to subpart B of Regulation E, and are not subject to the requirements for electronic disclosures set forth in § 1005.31(a)(2). Pursuant to § 1005.31(a)(2) and comment 31(a)(2)-1, a provider may provide the pre-payment disclosure to a sender in electronic form, without regard to the applicable requirements of the E-Sign Act, only if a sender electronically requests the provider to send the remittance transfer. However, with respect to other disclosures required by subpart B of Regulation E, the provider would have to comply with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act. Proposed comment 31(a)(2)-5 would have reflected similar guidance with respect to disclosures made by fax. For the reasons set forth below, comment 31(a)(2)-5 is adopted as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters overwhelmingly supported this aspect of the April Proposal. Several commenters asserted that the Bureau should expand the interpretation of “written disclosures” to include any electronic disclosure if the provider has met its obligations to comply with the E-Sign Act. Consumer group commenters had mixed reactions: one consumer group commenter supported the proposal, but the other asserted that faxes should be subject to the requirements for electronic disclosures set forth in § 1005.31(a)(2) because they are considered electronic records under the Uniform Electronic Transaction Act of 1999.<footnote ref="19">Uniform Electronic Transactions Act of 1999 section 2, comment 6 (2000), &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;available at http://www.uniformlaws.org/shared/docs/electronic%20transactions/ueta_final_99.pdf.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
           The Bureau has considered the comments and believes it is appropriate to use the Bureau's interpretive authority under EFTA to treat disclosures provided pursuant to § 1005.31 or § 1005.36 by fax as “written disclosures” for purposes of the Remittance Rule.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As the Bureau explained in the April Proposal, it considers disclosures made by fax to be a “writing” under the Remittance Rule because such disclosures are generally received on paper in a form the sender can retain. Additionally, the Bureau does not believe that treating faxes as writings will have any significant negative impact on the benefits consumers derive from the Remittance Rule, both because many consumers have long communicated with remittance transfer providers via fax and those consumers accept faxes as a legitimate and efficient method of communication. The Bureau observes that the consumer group that opposed interpreting disclosures provided via fax as written disclosures did not contend that such an interpretation would have a significant negative impact on the benefits consumers derive from the Remittance Rule. Thus, the Bureau believes it appropriate to interpret faxes as “a writing” for purposes of providing disclosures pursuant to § 1005.31 and § 1005.36. The Bureau, however, does not believe that it is necessary to clarify that any electronic disclosure constitutes a “writing” if the provider complies with the E-Sign Act. As discussed above, the Remittance Rule permits a provider to provide electronic disclosures instead of written disclosures, when such electronic disclosures are provided pursuant to § 1005.31(a)(2) as clarified by comment 31(a)(2)-1.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters strongly supported requiring these disclosures to be provided before payment, stating that providing pre-payment disclosures was a centerpiece of the statute. One consumer group commenter stated that pre-payment disclosures were necessary to facilitate shopping.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters, however, opposed the requirement to provide disclosures before payment. One industry trade association commenter argued that the disclosure would provide negligible benefits, citing the fact that some participants in the Board's consumer testing stated that they did not want a disclosure prior to payment. One industry commenter suggested that the pre-payment disclosures would confuse or irritate customers who would not understand why disclosure was being provided at that time. Another industry commenter stated that the pre-payment disclosures created needless compliance costs, which would be passed on to senders. As discussed above, some industry commenters urged that if pre-payment disclosures were required, that they be permitted to be disclosed orally or on a screen, even when the transaction is conducted in person, to reduce compliance costs and delays for the sender.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>A few industry commenters argued that the combined disclosure should be permitted to be provided after payment is made. One industry commenter noted that EFTA section 919(a)(5)(C) only requires combined disclosure to be accurate at the time payment is made. This commenter stated that providing a document similar to a receipt prior to payment is not possible because such a disclosure could not provide accurate information regarding the date and time of the transaction, the amount paid, and the transaction number, which are elements that help establish proof of payment. Therefore, this commenter argued that the rule should permit the combined disclosure to be provided after payment, if a pre-payment disclosure is provided orally or on a screen at the point-of-sale. This commenter maintained that allowing oral or electronic disclosures would be appropriate in the context of EFTA section 919(a)(5) authority to permit combined disclosures and in light of the Bureau's duty to consider the final rule's costs and benefits. At minimum, this commenter believed the Bureau should permit this method of disclosure for senders who have used the provider's service in the past.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Another industry commenter stated that it currently only had the capability of providing information to senders on a register receipt after payment. This commenter believed that requiring a combined disclosure to be provided prior to payment would require printing a pre-payment disclosure in the middle of a sales transaction.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau recognizes the operational challenges associated with providing pre-payment and particularly combined disclosures to senders prior to payment. However, although current practice generally is to provide written disclosures after payment is made, the statute clearly requires certain disclosures to be provided prior to payment and other disclosures to be provided when payment is made for the remittance transfer. The Bureau also believes that the statute precludes combined disclosures from being provided to senders after payment or in a non-written format. EFTA section 919(a)(5)(C) affirmatively requires that the combined disclosure be <em data-original="E-03">accurate at the time at which payment is made</em> (emphasis added). Such a requirement would be superfluous if the combined disclosure could be provided after payment because a disclosure provided after payment must accurately reflect the terms of the completed transaction pursuant to EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B). Accordingly, the Bureau believes the statute requires both the pre-payment disclosure and the combined disclosure be given prior to payment.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed below in § 1005.36, special timing rules have been adopted for preauthorized remittance transfers to account for the particular challenges associated with providing disclosures for transfers that may occur far in the future. Therefore, proposed § 205.31(e)(1) is adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(e)(1), with modifications to reference new § 1005.36. Section 1005.31(e)(1) states that except as provided in § 1005.36(a), a pre-payment disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(1) or a combined disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(3) must be provided to the sender when the sender requests the remittance transfer, but prior to payment for the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(e)-1 clarified when a sender has requested a remittance transfer, for purposes of determining when a pre-payment or combined disclosure must be provided. The proposed comment is adopted substantially as proposed, with a reference to the provisions for preauthorized remittance transfers in new § 1005.36. Comment 31(e)-1 states that, except as provided in § 1005.36(a), pre-payment and combined disclosures are required to be provided to the sender when the sender requests the remittance transfer, but prior to payment for the transfer. The comment clarifies that whether a consumer has requested a remittance transfer depends on the facts and circumstances. A sender that asks a provider to send a remittance transfer, and that provides transaction-specific information to the provider in order to send funds to a designated recipient, has requested a remittance transfer. For example, a sender who asks the provider to send money to a recipient in Mexico and provides the sender and recipient information to the provider has requested the remittance transfer provider to send a remittance transfer. In contrast, a consumer who solely inquires about that day's rates and fees to send to Mexico has not requested the remittance transfer provider to send a remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>31(e)(2) Timing of Receipts</title>
      <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B) requires that a receipt be provided to a sender at the time the sender makes payment in connection with the remittance transfer. Proposed § 205.31(e)(2) provided that a receipt must be provided to the sender when payment is made for the transaction. The Bureau did not receive comment on this proposed provision. Under the final rule, a receipt required to be provided by § 1005.31(b)(2) generally must be provided to the sender when payment is made for the remittance transfer, except for preauthorized remittance transfers as provided in § 1005.36(a). The Bureau notes that the final rule does not require the receipt to be provided at an exact moment when the sender, for example, hands cash or a credit card to an agent to pay for the transfer. Rather, the Bureau believes that payment for a remittance transfer is a process that may involve several steps. For example, payment for a transfer by credit card could involve a sender handing a credit card to an agent, the agent asking the sender for identification, the agent sending the credit card authorization request, the card authorization being approved, the agent requesting signature on a credit card receipt, and the sender signing the credit card receipt.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(e)-2 provided examples of when a remittance transfer provider may provide the sender a receipt. The Bureau did not receive comment on the proposed comment, which is adopted substantially as proposed. Comment 31(e)-2 in the final rule, however, adds a reference to the special timing rules for preauthorized remittance transfers in § 1005.36. The comment also adds a clarification regarding when a payment is made for purposes of the final rule, including an example stating that, for purposes of subpart B, payment is made when a sender authorizes a payment. The Bureau believes that, for purposes of subpart B, payment is made when a sender authorizes payment because a receipt will be most useful to a sender at that time. Otherwise, if payment is considered to be made when the funds actually leave the sender's account due to delays in processing a payment, a receipt may not be provided to a sender for a day or more. Furthermore, it is not clear how a sender's cancellation right would operate in this scenario. For example, because a sender does not know when funds leave an account, a sender would be unable to know when the cancellation right would be triggered.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(e)-2 in the final rule states that except as provided in § 1005.36(a), a receipt required by § 1005.31(b)(2) must be provided to the sender when payment is made for the remittance transfer. For example, a remittance transfer provider could give the sender the disclosures after the sender pays for the remittance transfer in person, but before the sender leaves the counter. A provider could also give the sender the disclosures immediately before the sender pays for the transaction. For purposes of subpart B, payment is made, for example, when a sender provides cash to the remittance transfer provider or when payment is authorized.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(e)(2) further stated that if a transaction is conducted entirely by telephone, a written receipt may be mailed or delivered to the sender no later than one business day after the date on which payment is made for the remittance transfer. If a transaction is conducted entirely by telephone and involves the transfer of funds from the sender's account held by the provider, the written receipt may be provided on or with the next regularly scheduled periodic statement. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> EFTA section 919(a)(5)(B). In some circumstances, a provider conducting such a transfer from the sender's account held by the provider is not required to provide a periodic statement under other laws. The Board believed that in such circumstances, it would be appropriate to permit the provider to provide a written receipt within a similar period of time as a periodic statement. Therefore, pursuant to EFTA section 904(c), the Board also proposed in § 205.31(e)(2) that the written receipt may be provided within 30 days after payment is made for the remittance transfer if a periodic statement is not required. Under the proposal, in order for the written receipt to be mailed or delivered to a sender conducting a transaction entirely by telephone at these later times, the remittance transfer provider was required to comply with the foreign language requirements of proposed § 205.31(g)(3).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter argued that the Bureau should include a timing exception in circumstances where a receipt is required to be provided to a sender shortly before a periodic statement is produced. This commenter stated that a remittance transfer provider may not be able to provide the required disclosures to a sender for a remittance transfer that occurs at the end of a billing cycle in time to include in the statement. The commenter suggested that in such circumstances, the Bureau should permit the receipt to be provided by the later of the next periodic statement date or 30 days after payment. The Bureau believes the final rule gives providers sufficient time to provide a receipt to a sender after a remittance transfer is sent; thus, no accommodation for transfers made at the end of a billing cycle is included in § 1005.31(e)(2). Because periodic statements must include certain information that occurs during a cycle, <em data-original="E-03">see</em> § 1005.9(b), the Bureau expects that, for purposes unrelated to this rule, providers already delay sending a periodic statement for a short time after a cycle ends to ensure that all activity occurring within a cycle is included in the appropriate statement.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and to facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA section 904(a) and (c) to adopt the provisions regarding mailing a receipt in proposed § 205.31(e)(2) as § 1005.31(e)(2) with revisions. Section 1005.31(e)(2) in the final rule eliminates the requirement to comply with proposed § 205.31(g)(3), because the provision has been eliminated in the final rule, as discussed in further detail below. Section 1005.31(e)(2) is also revised to state that if a transaction is conducted entirely by telephone and involves the transfer of funds from the sender's account held by the provider, the receipt may be provided within 30 days after payment is made for the remittance transfer if a periodic statement is not <em data-original="E-03">provided,</em> rather than if a periodic statement is not required. In some circumstances, a provider may provide a sender with a periodic statement even if one is not required to be provided. In these circumstances, the Bureau believes a provider should instead disclose the receipt on or with the periodic statement and that the provision allowing a provider to give a receipt 30 days after payment is made should not apply.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(e)(2) is further revised to account for circumstances in which a provider discloses the statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv), in order to use the telephone exceptions pursuant to § 1005.31(a)(3)(iii) or (a)(5)(iii). In those circumstances, the Bureau does not believe a provider should be required to repeat the statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation on a receipt when it has already been disclosed to the sender. Thus, pursuant to the Bureau's authority under EFTA section 919(d)(3), § 1005.31(e)(2) states that the statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) may, but need not, be disclosed pursuant to the timing requirements of § 1005.31(e)(2) if a provider discloses this information pursuant to § 1005.31(a)(3)(iii) or (a)(5)(iii). The Bureau also adds comment 31(e)(2)-5 to clarify that even though the statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation need not be disclosed pursuant to the timing requirements of § 1005.31(e)(2), the statement about the rights of the sender regarding error resolution required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) must be disclosed pursuant to the timing requirements of § 1005.31(e)(2).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(e)-3 provided further clarification regarding circumstances where a sender transfers funds from his or her account, as defined by § 205.2(b) (currently § 1005.2(b)), that is held by the remittance transfer provider. The Bureau did not receive comment on proposed comment 31(e)-3, which is adopted substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is providing further guidance in the final rule regarding the timing of receipts for remittance transfers made via mobile application or text message. As discussed above, because remittance transfers sent via mobile application or text message are conducted entirely by mobile telephone, the Bureau believes that EFTA section 919(a)(5)(A) permits pre-payment disclosures to be provided orally for such transfers. Similarly, the Bureau believes that that EFTA section 919(a)(5)(B) permits receipts for transfers sent entirely by telephone via mobile application or text message to be provided in accordance with the mailing rules provided for transactions conducted entirely by telephone in § 1005.31(e)(2) or § 1005.36(a). Therefore, the final rule adds a new comment 31(e)-4 to clarify that if a transaction is conducted entirely by telephone via mobile application or text message, a receipt required by § 1005.31(b)(2) may be mailed or delivered to the sender pursuant to the timing requirements in § 1005.31(e)(2) or § 1005.36(a). For example, if a sender conducts a transfer entirely by telephone via mobile application, a remittance transfer provider may mail or deliver the disclosures to a sender pursuant to the timing requirements in § 1005.31(e)(2) or § 1005.36(a).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, several industry commenters requested that the Bureau specifically permit remittance transfer providers to provide receipts for transactions conducted via mobile application or text message by email or through a provider's Web site. The Bureau notes that written receipts provided in accordance with § 1005.31(e)(2) or § 1005.36(a) may be provided electronically, subject to compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 31(a)(2)-1.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Comment 31(c)(4)-2 Segregation</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(c)(4) provides that written and electronic disclosures required by subpart B must be segregated from everything else and contain only information that is directly related to the disclosures required under subpart B.  Comment 31(c)(4)-2 in the 2012 Final Rule clarifies that, for purposes of § 1005.31(c)(4), the following is directly related information: (i) The date and time of the transaction; (ii) the sender's name and contact information; (iii) the location at which the designated recipient may pick up the funds; (iv) the confirmation or other identification code; (v) a company name and logo; (vi) an indication that a disclosure is or is not a receipt or other indicia of proof of payment; (vii) a designated area for signatures or initials; (viii) a statement that funds may be available sooner, as permitted by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii); (ix) instructions regarding the retrieval of funds, such as the number of days the funds will be available to the recipient before they are returned to the sender; and (x) a statement that the provider makes money from foreign currency exchange.  In light of new § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) permitting certain optional disclosures, the Bureau is amending this list to clarify that the optional disclosure of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected by a person other than the provider is directly related information.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>36(b) Accuracy</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.36(b) sets forth requirements for the accuracy of disclosures for preauthorized remittance transfers. For the first scheduled transfer, the disclosure requirements follow the accuracy rule set forth in § 1005.31(f) that generally applies to remittance transfers. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.36(b)(1). Thus, except as permitted by § 1005.32, the pre-payment disclosure and receipt provided for the first scheduled transfer must be accurate when payment is made; that is, at the time the transfer is authorized.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>However, for subsequent scheduled transfers, the disclosures described in § 1005.36(a)(2) must be accurate when the transfer is made. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.36(b)(2). Thus, for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers, the final rule provides that senders must receive an accurate pre-payment disclosure shortly before the transfer is made, and then an accurate receipt shortly after the transfer is made. Providers may continue to disclose estimates to the extent permitted by § 1005.32.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau believes that it would be problematic to apply the general rule about accuracy in § 1005.31(f) to subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. For example, some preauthorized remittance transfers are set up to vary in amount, so the provider cannot predict, at the time such transfers are authorized, the amount to be transferred in subsequent months. Therefore, the provider could not provide an accurate pre-payment disclosure and receipt at the time the preauthorized remittance transfers, and payment for the transfers, are authorized. The accuracy requirement in § 1005.31(f) also would present a challenge to determining an applicable exchange rate for subsequent transfers, in that the provider may not know the exchange rate that will apply to subsequent transfers at the time of authorization. Accordingly, to effectuate the purposes of the Act and to facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to adopt special requirements for accurate disclosures about subsequent scheduled transfers in § 1005.36(b). In the January 2012 Proposed Rule published elsewhere in today's <em data-original="E-04">Federal Register</em>, the Bureau is also soliciting comment on the use of estimates for certain disclosures with respect to the first scheduled transfer.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>The February Final Rule contains, in § 1005.36(b), requirements for the accuracy of disclosures for preauthorized remittance transfers. Under that provision in the February Final Rule, the pre-payment disclosures and receipt for the first scheduled transfers in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers are required to be accurate at the time of payment (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> they must comply with § 1005.31(f), which states that disclosures must be accurate when a sender makes payment for the remittance transfer, except to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32). For subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers, as discussed above, the February Final Rule requires providers to give accurate pre-payment disclosures as of when the transfer is made within a reasonable time prior to each transfer and then to provide an accurate receipt after each transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>To further compliance and to enhance consumer protections, the Bureau finds it necessary and proper to use its EFTA section 904(a) and (c) authority to adopt a revised § 1005.36(b). The Bureau is revising § 1005.36(b) to address the accuracy of receipts provided for remittance transfers that are scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer, as well as preauthorized remittance transfers. The Bureau is adopting § 1005.36(b)(1), which states that for a one-time transfer scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer or the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, disclosures provided in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) must comply with § 1005.31(f) by being accurate when the sender makes payment, except to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers, the Bureau is adopting § 1005.36(b)(2), which states that for each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer, the most recent receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i) must be accurate as of when such transfer is made, except: (i) The temporal elements required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) (Date Available) and (b)(2)(vii) (Transfer Date) must be accurate only if the transfer is the first transfer to occur after the disclosure was provided, and (ii) to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32. As noted above, since a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i) may serve as a disclosure with respect to multiple subsequent preauthorized transfers, the temporal elements disclosed on those receipts need only be accurate with respect to the transfer to occur after the receipt is provided.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>To address situations in which receipts may be provided after the date of a remittance transfer, the Bureau is adopting a new § 1005.36(b)(3). That provision states that such receipts (provided pursuant to either § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) or (a)(2)(ii)) must be accurate as of when the remittance transfer to which it pertains is made, except to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32(a) or (b)(1).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 36(b)-1 addressed estimates and, in particular, stated that providers may use any of the exceptions set forth in § 1005.32, to the extent applicable. This comment is adopted largely as proposed, with changes to reflect the newly adopted § 1005.32(b)(2), which allows for estimates in certain disclosures for transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer, and the revised § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) and (a)(2)(i), which permit use of estimates under § 1005.32(b)(2). The comment also notes that when estimates are permitted, they must be disclosed in accordance with § 1005.31(d).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 36(b)-2 explains that, for a subsequent transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i), except for the temporal disclosures in that receipt required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) (Date Available) and (b)(2)(vii) (Transfer Date), applies to each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer unless and until it is superseded by a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(2)(i). For each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer, only the most recent receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i) must be accurate as of the date each subsequent transfer is made. As a receipt may apply to multiple transfers in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.</em> disclosure of the date in the foreign country on which funds will be available to the designated recipient) need not be accurate for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers that occur after the first transfer to which the receipt pertains.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, new comment 36(b)-3 clarifies that a receipt required by § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) must accurately reflect the details of the transfer to which it pertains and may not contain estimates pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2). However, the remittance transfer provider may continue to disclose estimates to the extent permitted by § 1005.32(a) or (b)(1). In providing receipts pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) or (a)(2)(ii), § 1005.36(b)(2) and (b)(3) do not allow a remittance transfer provider to change figures previously disclosed on a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i), unless a figure was an estimate or based on an estimate disclosed pursuant to § 1005.32. Thus, for example, if a provider disclosed its fee as $10 in a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) and that receipt contained an estimate of the exchange rate pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2), the second receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) must also disclose the fee as $10. The Bureau is adopting this comment to clarify that the purpose of receipts required by § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) and (a)(2)(ii) is to provide a sender with the actual exchange rate applied to the transfer (unless the statutory exceptions for estimates apply) rather than the estimate previously disclosed for the transfer pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2). Thus, the final rule does not permit a provider to change other items, such as non-estimated fees and taxes, from a prior disclosure applicable to that transfer on the post-transfer receipt.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(b)(4)(vii) Regulation Z Disclosures for Overdraft Credit Features</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii)(B) would have required the financial institution to include in the long form the disclosures described in Regulation Z § 1026.60(a), (b), and (c) if, at any point, a credit plan that would be a credit card account under Regulation Z (12 CFR part 1026) may be offered in connection with the prepaid account. Regulation Z § 1026.60 sets forth disclosure requirements for credit and charge card application and solicitations commonly referred to as “Schumer Box” disclosures. Section 1026.60(b) lists the required disclosure elements, § 1026.60(a) contains general rules for such disclosures, and § 1026.60(c) contains specific requirements for direct mail and electronic applications and solicitations. Proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii)(B) would have explained that a credit plan that would be a credit card account under proposed Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(15) could be structured either as a credit plan that could be accessed through the same device that accesses the prepaid account, or through an account number where extensions of credit are permitted to be deposited directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor offering the plan.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau recognized that Regulation Z does not require these disclosures to be provided until a consumer is actually solicited for a credit plan. The Bureau, however, believed it would be important for consumers who are considering whether to acquire a prepaid account to know not only if a credit plan could be offered at any point, as would have been required to be disclosed in the short form pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">9</em>), but also what the possible cost of such a plan might be. Because of the space constraints on the short form, as discussed in the proposal, the Bureau believed it would be appropriate for a consumer to receive as part of the long form disclosure more complete information about any credit plan that could be offered to them, even if they would not be solicited for such a plan until at least 30 days after registering a particular prepaid account pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(g) and proposed Regulation Z § 1026.12(h).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(ii)(B)-1 would have clarified that the disclosures described in Regulation Z § 1026.60(a), (b), and (c) must appear in the form required under § 1026.60(a), (b), and (c), and, to the extent possible, on the same printed page or Web page as the rest of the information required to be listed pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii). The Bureau recognized that depending on the number of fees included in the long form disclosure, it might not be possible to include both disclosures on the same printed page. The Bureau believed, however, that to the extent it would be possible to include these disclosures on the same printed page or Web page, doing so would make it easier for the consumer to review the disclosures.

        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>An issuing bank opposed the proposed requirement to include the above-cited Regulation Z disclosures along with the long form disclosure, arguing that providing this level of detail regarding a potential overdraft or credit feature of a prepaid account is not logical at the pre-acquisition stage. It cautioned the information disclosed will likely be outdated by the time a consumer seeks or is offered such credit, and suggested that consumers may become confused or angry if the actual credit terms offered differ from those disclosed in the long form, which it said is likely considering the mandatory 30-day waiting period before solicitation and infrequency with which the proposed rule would have required updating disclosures in a retail location. It stated that this would result in stale Regulation Z disclosures, including the APR, that could be more than a year old at the time a consumer would actually apply for credit. The commenter suggested that the disclosures would confuse consumers who, upon seeing them in the long form disclosure, will likely assume credit is being or will be offered to them. The commenter also expressed concern that consumers seeking credit who do not ultimately qualify for it may be confused or angered and suspect the financial institution has engaged in discrimination or false advertising. Finally, the commenter expressed concern that consumers who do obtain credit may be confused by being provided with the Regulation Z disclosures again at the time of solicitation and, perhaps, with changed terms. In sum, the commenter recommended that the Bureau remove this long form requirement as likely to provide little consumer benefit but rather lead to significant consumer misunderstanding.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A consumer group commenter supported disclosure of the Regulation Z and E information on the same page, if possible.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii)(B), renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(4)(vii), with certain modifications. The Bureau is also finalizing proposed comment 18(b)(2)(ii)(B)-1, renumbered as 18(b)(4)(vii)-1, with certain revisions and is adding new comment 18(b)(4)(vii)-2, as discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Specifically, final § 1005.18(b)(4)(vii) requires that, as part of the long form disclosure, the disclosures required by Regulation Z § 1026.60(e)(1) must be given, in accordance with the requirements for such disclosures in § 1026.60, if a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in § 1026.61, may be offered to a consumer in connection with the prepaid account. Under the proposal, a financial institution would have been required to include the Regulation Z disclosures pursuant to § 1026.60(a), (b), and (c). While the content required for disclosures given under Regulation Z § 1026.60(b) and (e)(1) are largely the same, the disclosures pursuant to § 1026.60(e)(1) are tailored for credit card applications and solicitations made available to the general public—commonly referred to as “take one” disclosures—which the Bureau believes to be more apt for inclusion in the long form.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the proposal and in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(2)(x) above, the Bureau believes it is important for consumers to be informed of the key costs and terms of an overdraft credit feature in order to be able to make informed purchase and use decisions with regard to both prepaid accounts and associated overdraft credit features—even though they may not be eligible for the feature until after a waiting period or at all. In response to the comment suggesting that such information may become stale and cause consumer confusion or worse, the Bureau notes that Regulation Z § 1026.60(e)(1) permits inclusion in a prominent location in the disclosure of the date the required information was printed, including a statement that the required information was accurate as of that date and is subject to change after that date, as well as a statement and contact information regarding any change in the required information since it was printed. The Bureau has also added an additional provision to § 1005.18(b)(4)(vii), discussed below, limiting the requirement to update these disclosures. For an overview of the Bureau's overall approach to regulating overdraft credit features offered in conjunction with prepaid accounts, see the <em data-original="E-03">Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z</em> section below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.18(b)(4)(vii) also provides that a financial institution may, but is not required to, include above the Regulation Z disclosures required by § 1005.18(b)(4)(vii), a heading or other explanatory information introducing the overdraft credit feature. Given the organization of the long form disclosure and the placement of the Regulation Z disclosures at the end, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to provide financial institutions this option in case they deem it necessary or appropriate to include brief additional text to orient or explain to consumers to the ensuing disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, the final rule provides that a financial institution is not required to revise the disclosures required by final § 1005.18(b)(4)(vii) to reflect a change in the fees or other terms disclosed therein until such time as the financial institution manufactures, prints, or otherwise produces new prepaid account packaging materials or otherwise updates the long form disclosure. In conjunction with the final rule's incorporation of the Regulation Z § 1026.60(e)(1) disclosures, the Bureau believes it would be inefficient to require financial institutions to update their long form disclosures (and their initial disclosures, pursuant to final § 1005.18(f)(2)), each time a change is made to the fees and terms required to be included in the credit portion of that disclosure. The Bureau has thus added this exception, which mirrors the exception for third-party fees in final § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) discussed above.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Final comment 18(b)(4)(vii)-1 provides guidance on where these disclosures must be located in the long form. Specifically, it states that if the financial institution includes the disclosures described in Regulation Z § 1026.60(e)(1), pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(7)(i)(B), such disclosures must appear below the disclosures required by final § 1005.18(b)(4)(vi). If the disclosures provided pursuant to Regulation Z § 1026.60(e)(1) are provided in writing, these disclosures must appear in the form required by § 1026.60(a)(2), and to the extent possible, on the same page as the other disclosures required by final § 1005.18(b)(4). The Bureau continues to believe that consumers could more easily review these Regulation Z disclosures if they are on the same page as the rest of the long form information, although the Bureau understands that this may not be possible depending on the length of the prepaid account program's long form.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Final comment 18(b)(4)(vii)-2 explains that the updating exception in § 1005.18(b)(4)(vii) does not extend to any finance charges imposed on the prepaid account as described in final Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii), in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in final § 1026.61 that are required to be disclosed on the long form pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii). This comment also cross-references final comment 18(b)(4)(ii)-1.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, existing § 1005.18(b) states that financial institutions that issue payroll cards can provide periodic statements that comply with the general provisions in Regulation E, or alternatively, the institution must make available to the consumer: (1) The account balance, through a readily available telephone line; (2) an electronic history of account transactions that covers at least 60 days (including all the information required in periodic statements by § 1005.9(b)); and (3) a written history of account transactions that is provided promptly in response to an oral or written request and that covers at least 60 days (including all the information required in periodic statements by § 1005.9(b)). The Bureau proposed to extend this alternative to all prepaid accounts, with certain modifications, as described in the section-by-section analyses of § 1005.18(c)(1)(i) through (iii) below.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received a number of comments regarding whether the Regulation E periodic statement requirement should be applied to prepaid accounts. Many consumer groups supported such a requirement, arguing that the periodic statement is an important tool for managing consumer finances, as consumers use information about their account usage when making financial decisions. One commenter also argued that receiving periodic statements encourages consumers to monitor their accounts on a regular basis for errors and unauthorized transactions. Another commenter requested that the Bureau require financial institutions to provide annual statements for record-keeping and tax-preparation purposes.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several of these commenters and one State government agency argued that consumers should have the option to sign up for paper periodic statements for free or a nominal fee, instead of having to call each time to make a request—taking up customer service resources and possibly incurring a fee. These commenters argued that periodic statements in paper form are essential for recordkeeping purposes, especially for older consumers and consumers with no internet or electronic access. These commenters also argued that paper periodic statements are more convenient and easier to review for consumers who find it difficult to remember passwords or log into their online accounts, or for consumers who simply prefer paper over electronic statements. One commenter stated that a myriad of regulations, laws, and court procedures necessitate the continued availability of paper periodic statements and noted several circumstances in which it believed paper statements are necessary.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Conversely, some industry commenters, including issuing banks, credit unions, and a credit union trade association, argued that periodic statements should not be required for prepaid accounts, considering the lifespan of a prepaid account is usually very short. One commenter added that statements would not make sense particularly for non-reloadable, low-value prepaid accounts, as these products are anonymous and do not have the functionality or associated fees of reloadable prepaid accounts, deposit accounts, or other traditional bank accounts. Some commenters argued that a periodic statement requirement would impose unnecessary costs and recordkeeping burdens and provide consumers little value, as they prefer immediate, electronic access to their account information and transaction history. Regarding the form and content of the periodic statement, a few credit union trade associations requested a model form, and an issuing bank requested clarification regarding the information that would be required on the statement.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is finalizing the portion of the proposal that extends the Regulation E periodic statement requirement to prepaid accounts. As stated above, the requirement to provide consumers with a periodic statement for each account that may be accessed by means of an EFT is required by EFTA section 906(c), and the Bureau does not believe it would be appropriate to completely exempt prepaid accounts from this requirement. The Bureau also recognizes that access to account information—whether through a periodic statement or the periodic statement alternative pursuant to final § 1005.18(c)(1) discussed below—is essential for consumers to manage their prepaid accounts and to monitor account transactions and fees on a regular basis.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau declines to require financial institutions to provide periodic statements in paper form, as requested by several commenters. The Bureau notes that § 1005.4(a)(1) allows disclosures, including periodic statements, required by Regulation E to be provided to the consumer in electronic form, subject to compliance with the consumer-consent and other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act.<footnote ref="471">15 U.S.C. 7001 &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;et seq.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
             The Bureau does not believe it is necessary or appropriate at this time to mandate paper statements for prepaid accounts. Regarding one commenter's request for an annual statement, the Bureau believes consumers will have sufficient access to account information through periodic statements pursuant to § 1005.9(b) or through electronic and written account transaction histories pursuant to the periodic statement alternative in final § 1005.18(c)(1).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe it is necessary to provide additional information or guidance about the form and content of the periodic statement, as requested by some commenters. Because prepaid accounts are subject to Regulation E by virtue of this final rule, the requirements for periodic statements set forth in § 1005.9(b), as well as the general disclosure requirements in § 1005.4, apply to prepaid accounts.<footnote ref="472">As discussed below, final § 1005.18(c)(3) requires that electronic and written account transaction histories under the periodic statement alternative include all of the information set forth in § 1005.9(b).</footnote>
             The Bureau reminds financial institutions that the requirement in final § 1005.18(c)(5) to display the summary totals of fees for the prior calendar month and the calendar year to date applies to financial institutions providing periodic statements as well as those following the alternative, as discussed below. The requirement to provide a periodic statement under Regulation E is separate from the requirement under final Regulation Z § 1026.7(b) with respect to a covered separate credit feature that is accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. See the section-by-section analyses of Regulation Z §§ 1026.6 and 1026.7(b) for additional information regarding the Regulation Z periodic statement requirement.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received several comments addressing the periodic statement alternative generally. Several consumer groups, a State government agency, industry trade associations, and a few credit unions supported the proposal, arguing that the alternative would benefit consumers and impose little to no additional burden on industry. These commenters explained that the requirements to provide account information by telephone and online are consistent with consumer preference. These commenters further stated that the alternative would impose no additional costs and burden for financial institutions that currently provide periodic statements. One of the consumer groups urged the Bureau to require all financial institutions to provide access to account information as would be required under the proposed alternative, even if financial institutions provide periodic statements pursuant to § 1005.9(b).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Conversely, several industry commenters, including credit union trade associations, a credit union, and a think tank, argued that the proposed alternative would provide no relief to financial institutions and could in fact be equally or more costly and burdensome than providing periodic statements, leaving financial institutions—particularly credit unions—with few options. These commenters explained that financial institutions that do not have the proper infrastructure in place to meet the requirements of the alternative would need to invest in system upgrades and Web site development and coordinate with third-party data processors to obtain the information needed to provide periodic statements or account transaction history. Several of the credit union trade associations explained that most credit unions rely on third parties to maintain their Web sites and to provide the data for account transaction history; therefore, reliance on the third parties to capture the required information and to make necessary changes would require industry-wide coordination and may result in higher fees. Several other credit union trade associations argued that the proposed alternative would not be appropriate for prepaid accounts because prepaid accounts are generally seen as short-term or disposable products, and the consumer relationship typically lasts as long as there are funds available on the account. Relatedly, one think tank argued that government agencies would find it difficult to manage beneficiaries' account transaction histories for 18 months.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons discussed herein, the Bureau is finalizing § 1005.18(c)(1) generally as proposed, with certain modifications as discussed below. To further the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account consumers, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to create an exception to the periodic statement requirements of EFTA section 906(c), because the periodic statement alternative will assist consumers' understanding of their prepaid account activity.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes the periodic statement alternative adopted by the Board for payroll card accounts, with the modifications discussed below, is appropriate to extend to all prepaid accounts. The Bureau proposed to adopt the periodic statement alternative for prepaid accounts, which was based on the on the alternative under the Payroll Card Rule, to reduce some of the burden financial institutions would have otherwise experienced if required to provide periodic statements for prepaid accounts. The Bureau believes that the alternative it is adopting not only helps reduce costs, but also strikes the appropriate balance between providing consumers with access to their account information and not unnecessarily burdening financial institutions. Specifically, financial institutions that wish to provide periodic statements may do so (either on paper or electronically with E-Sign consent <footnote ref="473">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; § 1005.4(a)(1).</footnote>
            ), while financial institutions that find such an approach problematic or undesirable—because of the cost, burden, or otherwise—may instead follow the alternative. Regardless of which option a financial institution chooses, consumers will have access to account information either by virtue of a periodic statement or through the methods required under the alternative (that is, account balance by telephone, electronic account transaction history, and written account transaction history upon request).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not expect the alternative to be particularly burdensome for most financial institutions. As noted in the Bureau's Study of Prepaid Account Agreements and other public studies, many financial institutions already follow the existing alternative from the Payroll Card Rule.<footnote ref="474">See Study of Prepaid Account Agreements at 18 tbl.5. The Bureau found that almost all prepaid account agreements reviewed (including 99.03 percent of agreements reviewed for GPR card programs) provide electronic access to account information; a majority of programs reviewed (including 73.91 percent of agreements for GPR card programs) explicitly provide that transactional history is available for at least 60 days (which is consistent with the payroll card account alternative in existing § 1005.18(b)); and most programs reviewed (including 88.41 percent of agreements for GPR card programs) make clear that paper statements or paper account histories are available upon request. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See id.&lt;/em&gt; at 19 tbl.6 and 21 tbl.8. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See also&lt;/em&gt; Ctr. for Fin. Services Innovation, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;2016 Prepaid Industry Scorecard: Assessing Quality in the Prepaid Industry with CFSI's Compass Principles,&lt;/em&gt; at 4 (Mar. 2016), &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;available at&lt;/em&gt;

             Because consumers need reliable access to account information to manage their prepaid accounts and to assist them when making financial decisions generally, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to require that financial institutions must either provide a periodic statement or follow the alternative. Reliable access to account information is especially important since prepaid accounts have become more prevalent in recent years and are increasingly being used as replacements for traditional checking accounts; that is, they are no longer universally seen or used as short-term or disposable products. Regarding commenters' concerns about the costs and burden associated with the alternative, the Bureau believes the modifications it has made to the length of time electronic and written account transaction histories must cover, as discussed below, will help alleviate those concerns.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau declines to require all financial institutions to provide access to account information as required under the alternative, even if they provide periodic statements, as requested by a commenter, as it does not believe it to be necessary or appropriate to do so at this time. As discussed above, the Bureau proposed to adopt the periodic statement alternative for prepaid accounts in order to reduce some of the burden financial institutions experience with regard to mailing periodic statements. Requiring a financial institution to provide access to account information pursuant to the alternative, despite its election to provide periodic statements, would contradict the intended purpose of the alternative.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau sought comment on the methods of access consumers need to their account information and on other alternatives to the Payroll Card Rule's approach regarding access to account information. The Bureau received several industry and consumer group comments in response to this request. All of these commenters generally supported the idea that consumers should have access to their prepaid account information. However, commenters were divided on whether the Bureau should require other methods of access—in addition to the periodic statement requirement pursuant to § 1005.9(b) and the periodic statement alternative provided by final § 1005.18(c)(1)—and whether such access should be provided at no cost to the consumer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several consumer groups urged the Bureau to require free text message and email alerts and free access to customer service, arguing that these methods are essential tools for consumers to successfully manage their accounts. These commenters argued that imposing fees to access account information discourages consumers, especially those experiencing financial hardship, from monitoring transactions and exercising their error resolution rights under Regulation E. These commenters explained that text messages and email alerts provide a quick and easy way for consumers to be notified about low account balances and transactions made. One commenter stated that offering text message updates available at no charge can help consumers that have limited internet access and also assist financial institutions in identifying fraud and other unauthorized transactions more quickly. In addition, these commenters explained that consumers need access to customer service for a variety of reasons, such as to ask questions, check balances, dispute charges, and verify the receipt of wages and other transactions. Several commenters requested that the Bureau require foreign language support for customer service calls, particularly if a financial institution uses a foreign language in connection with the marketing or acquisition of a prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>On the other hand, industry commenters argued against a requirement to provide other methods of access for account information at no cost to the consumer. These commenters stated that text message and email alerts should be optional, so that financial institutions can determine the needs of their customers without unnecessary restrictions. These commenters also stated that providing various methods of access to account information can be costly to industry and therefore financial institutions should be permitted to charge consumers reasonable fees for certain methods of access.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has considered the above comments and declines to require financial institutions to provide other methods of access to account information at this time. The Bureau is concerned that requiring financial institutions to provide free text message and email alerts and free access to customer service could increase technological and operational costs and burdens, including the hiring and training of additional customer service personnel. The Bureau also believes that financial institutions can assess the methods of access that best meet the needs of their customers. For example, the Bureau is aware that many financial institutions already provide free text message and email alerts and access to customer service, as the competitive nature of the industry is moving financial institutions to offer these services.<footnote ref="475">The CFSI found that 60 percent of the prepaid market sampled (11 of 22 cards) allows users to customize alerts (compared to 30 percent of the market sampled (7 of 18 cards) in 2014). The CFSI noted that 11 cards allow cardholders to set a “low balance” threshold and receive an email or text alert when their balance falls below that threshold. Five cards also allow users to select notifications of transactions or withdrawals over a certain dollar amount. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 2016 CFSI Scorecard at 2, 9 &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;. See also&lt;/em&gt;
              &lt;em data-original="E-03"/&gt; 2014 Pew Study at 19-20.</footnote>
             However, the Bureau believes that the periodic statement requirement of § 1005.9(b) or the periodic statement alternative in final § 1005.18(c)(1) is sufficient at this time to ensure that all prepaid consumers have access to their account information.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Regarding commenters' request that the Bureau require financial institutions to provide foreign language support for customer service, the Bureau does not believe such a requirement is necessary or appropriate at this time. The Bureau understands that financial institutions that market prepaid accounts in foreign languages generally offer customer service support in those languages and that some offer foreign language customer service support, particularly in Spanish, even if they do not engage in foreign language marketing. However, the Bureau has concerns about the costs and burdens to industry, if it were to formalize such a requirement in this final rule. While consumers will have the right to obtain, in certain situations, pre-acquisition disclosures in a foreign language pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(9), the Bureau is concerned that a foreign-language customer-service requirement here could deter financial institutions from offering prepaid accounts in foreign languages because financial institutions would have to ensure, among other things, that live customer service in a foreign language is available at all times. However, the Bureau will continue to monitor industry practice in this area and may revisit this issue in a future rulemaking.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>32(b)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(iii)</title>
      <analysisParagraph>To accommodate the allowance for estimates of exchange rates in certain disclosures for remittance transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer, several additional provisions are included in § 1005.32(b)(2) regarding other information disclosed in pre-payment disclosures and receipts.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.32(b)(2)(ii) permitted a remittance transfer provider to estimate taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider for transfers scheduled more than ten days before the date of transfer only if those taxes were a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient and are to be disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be received. Proposed § 1005.32(b)(2)(iii)(A) similarly permitted a remittance transfer provider to estimate fees imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider for transfers scheduled more than ten days before the date of transfer only if those fees were a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient and are to be disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be received. Unlike proposed § 1005.32(b)(2)(ii), proposed § 1005.32(b)(2)(iii) contained an additional provision—§ 1005.32(b)(2)(iii)(B)—that, in effect, reasserted the temporary exception (in § 1005.32(a)) for “insured institutions” to estimate fees. Because § 1005.32(a) remains unchanged in the final rule and continues to apply regardless of the application of § 1005.32(b)(2), the Bureau believes it unnecessary to include a provision incorporating that exception.<footnote ref="14">For the same reasons, the Bureau is not adopting the proposed change to comment 32(c)(1)-1, concerning potential transmittal routes or proposed comment 32(b)(2)-1 concerned fees imposed on the remittance transfer provider by a person other than the remittance transfer provider. The Bureau received no comments regarding comment 32(b)(2)-1. Nevertheless, the Bureau is not adopting the proposed comment because it is duplicative. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; § 1005.32(a) and (b)(2)(ii). The final rule continues, in effect, to allow estimates for the fees described in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) in two circumstances: (i) Where the fees are calculated as a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2)(ii); or (ii) where an “insured institution” as defined in § 1005.32(a)(3) is permitted to estimate fees under the temporary exception in § 1005.32(a).</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As a result, there is no longer a need for separate provisions for estimation of the fees and taxes in the disclosure required under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). In place of proposed § 1005.32(b)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(iii)(A), as well as proposed comment 32(b)(2)-7, the Bureau adopts § 1005.32(b)(2)(ii), which provides that fees and taxes described in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) may be estimated under § 1005.32(b)(2)(i) only if the exchange rate is also estimated under § 1005.32(b)(2)(i) and the estimated exchange rate affects the amount of fees and taxes under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). The revised provision expands the ability to estimate fees and taxes to cover not just situations in which the tax or fee is a percentage of the amount of the funds transferred, but also to cover situations in which a tax or fee may otherwise vary depending on the exchange rate (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.</em> a tax is only charged on transfers that exceed a certain threshold denominated in the currency in which the funds will be received, and that amount depends on the exchange rate).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The final rule also includes § 1005.32(b)(2)(iii). This provision allows remittance transfer providers to estimate fees and taxes in certain disclosures provided for remittance transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer, when a remittance transfer provider agrees to a sender's request to fix the amount to be transferred in the currency in which the remittance transfer will be received and not the currency in which it is funded. But § 1005.32(b)(2)(iii) explains that fees and taxes described in § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) may be estimated under § 1005.32(b)(2)(i) only if the amount that will be transferred in the currency in which it is funded is also estimated under § 1005.32(b)(2)(i), and the estimated amount affects the amount of such fees and taxes.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Disclosure of Formulas Used To Calculate the Exchange Rate</title>
        <analysisParagraph>In the February Proposal, the Bureau sought comment on whether, in lieu of providing an estimate of the exchange rate for a remittance transfer scheduled before the date of transfer, the Bureau should allow providers to disclose a formula that will be used to calculate the exchange rate that will apply to such a transfer, and that is based on information that is publicly available prior to the time of transfer. The sender could then use that formula to calculate the exchange rate that will apply to the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several industry and consumer group commenters supported the use of such a formula although they disagreed on whether its use should be optional. One industry commenter stated that the disclosure of a formula could eliminate the need for remittance transfer providers to manage exchange rate risk and would reduce the burden on providers as compared to a rule that required providers to disclose actual exchange rates for transfers scheduled before the date of transfer. Another industry commenter favored disclosure of formulas rather than estimates for remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer because the volatility of currency markets makes disclosure of estimates of limited utility to senders trying to gauge the pricing of a particular provider's services. Other industry commenters stated that either a formula or use of estimates could reduce compliance burden on providers. One consumer group favored the use of formulas whenever the Bureau would also permit estimates on disclosures provided more than ten days before the date of transfer because formulas may make comparison shopping easier for consumers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In contrast, one industry commenter preferred disclosure of estimates to formulas because, the commenter stated, for remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer, it would be easier to provide an estimate of an exchange rate to senders and such an estimate would be easier for a sender to understand.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that, in some cases, compared to either an estimated or an actual exchange rate, a well-designed formula could better serve consumers and potentially reduce burden on remittance transfer providers. The Bureau believes that, given the nature of foreign currency markets, in many cases, any estimate of the exchange rate for a remittance transfer scheduled days or weeks in the future may not provide a highly precise indication to the sender of the exchange rate that would actually be applied to the sender's transfer. By contrast, a formula that will be used to calculate the exchange rate applicable to a transfer could provide more certainty to a sender as to relative prices or the pricing mechanism used and allow the sender to calculate the actual exchange rate that will apply to a transfer, before the date of the transfer. In addition, disclosing a formula would reduce the need for a remittance transfer provider to manage the currency risk associated with providing an accurate exchange rate for a transfer scheduled before the date of transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Nevertheless, the Bureau does not believe it is appropriate to allow for the use of formulas in disclosures at this time. First, the Bureau is concerned that the disclosure of formulas themselves could be confusing to senders if not designed in a way that consumers can understand. Second, if a formula was not required to be disclosed by all remittance transfer providers, the Bureau is concerned that consumer confusion could be a problem if some providers disclose formulas while others disclose estimates. However, the Bureau expects to continue evaluating how disclosures can most effectively inform senders without imposing undue burden on remittance transfer providers.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>15(a) Government Agency Subject to Regulation</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1005.15(a)(1) provides, <em data-original="E-03">inter alia,</em> that a government agency shall comply with all applicable requirements of EFTA and Regulation E, except as provided in § 1005.15. Existing § 1005.15(a)(2), in turn, defines the term “account” to mean an account established by a government agency for distributing government benefits to a consumer electronically, such as through ATMs or POS terminals (not including an account for distributing needs-tested benefits in a program established under State or local law or administered by a State or local agency). The Bureau proposed to adjust the final sentence of § 1005.15(a)(1) to reflect that proposed § 1005.15 would include substantive requirements, and not just exceptions to Regulation E requirements. In addition, for ease of reference, the Bureau proposed to define an account under § 1005.15(a)(2) as a “government benefit account.”</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As it stated in the proposal, the Bureau did not intend for the proposed revisions to impact the existing scope of § 1005.15(a). Numerous commenters asked the Bureau to clarify that government benefit accounts would continue to be covered under the existing requirements of Regulation E, rather than under the new requirements applying to prepaid accounts. One industry commenter, for example, argued that the final rule should exempt from coverage all cards used to distribute government benefits, regardless of whether such benefits are needs-tested. Other industry commenters asked the Bureau to exempt cards used to disburse certain types of benefits—for example, child support, unemployment insurance, and workers' compensation benefits. Currently, these commenters noted, the issuers of these cards administer the programs at no cost to the government agency disbursing the benefit, and at little cost to consumers. If saddled with the costs of complying with the various requirements of the proposed rule, they argued, these issuers may increase their fees or stop issuing government benefit cards altogether.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters, by contrast, advocated that the Bureau expand the scope of the “government benefit account” definition to include additional account types, including accounts that are expressly exempted from Regulation E now. A significant number of consumer group commenters argued that the Bureau should clarify that the exemption for needs-tested government benefit programs established or administered under State or local law does not apply to prepaid accounts. According to these commenters, the rationales for the exemption were either outdated or should not apply to prepaid cards. For example, one consumer group commenter noted that the exemption was intended to relieve regulatory burden for State and local governments, whereas the vast majority of government benefit accounts today are administered by financial institutions that are well-equipped to handle Regulation E compliance. Commenters argued additionally that the recipients of needs-tested benefits are, by definition, the neediest of all prepaid consumers, and thus should be entitled to the full protections of the Bureau's final rule governing prepaid accounts.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has considered the comments but believes that changes to the scope of the government benefit account definition are not warranted at this time. As discussed above, the Bureau did not intend its proposed changes to the definition of government benefit account to affect the scope of § 1005.15's coverage, nor did it contemplate or seek comment on whether or how it should narrow or expand the scope of the definition in the final rule. The Bureau understands that the existing scope of the definition, which has been in place since 1997, is well-established and forms the basis of current industry, government, and consumer practices, and it is not persuaded that the policy rationales presented by the commenters warrant unsettling the status quo with respect to the scope of coverage for government benefit accounts. The Bureau likewise declines to exempt government benefit accounts from the new requirements of this final rule, as some industry commenters requested. As detailed in the following sections, the Bureau believes that this final rule's revisions to existing government benefit account requirements, such as the requirements for pre-acquisition disclosures and enhanced access to account information, will substantially benefit consumers by providing them with a full, accurate, and timely disclosure of all of their account's terms and fees, and by helping them gain a more complete picture of their account activity. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting the revisions to § 1005.15(a) as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting the portion of proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) that addressed the option to disclose a short form only for a multiple service plan's default plan, renumbered § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) with technical modifications to the rule for conformity and clarity.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) provides that when a financial institution offers multiple service plans within a particular prepaid account program and each plan has a different fee schedule, the information required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (ix) may be provided in the tabular format described in final § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(A) for the service plan in which a consumer is initially enrolled by default upon acquiring a prepaid account. New comment 18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>)-1 clarifies that, pursuant to the requirement in § 1005.18(b)(3)(i) to disclose the highest amount a financial institution may impose for a fee disclosed pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (vii) and (ix), a financial institution would not be permitted to disclose any short-term or promotional service plans as a default service plan.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In accordance with § 1005.18(b)(3)(i), a financial institution providing a short form for a multiple service plan's default plan only must disclose the highest fees under the default plan but not the highest fees across all service plans. The Bureau believes that to require otherwise would distort the information disclosed about the default service plan, leading to potential consumer confusion.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that financial institutions disclosing the default plan can inform consumers of the prepaid program's other service plan options outside the short form disclosure, such as on other portions of the packaging, online, or via the telephone; further, disclosure of all plan information is required in the long form pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(4) discussed below. The Bureau also notes that nothing in the final rule would prohibit a financial institution from providing a short form disclosure for each of its service plans separately (such as on its Web site or in other acquisition scenarios without the same space constraints as in retail locations) though, if doing so, the Bureau encourages financial institutions to make clear to consumers which plan, if any, is the default plan.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) would have required that the information required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii) must be presented for all service plans in the form of a table substantially similar to proposed Sample Form A-10(g). The Bureau did not receive any comments regarding this portion of the proposal.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>), with a minor modification as described below, as well as with technical modifications for conformity and clarity.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>) states that the information in the long form disclosure required by final § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) must be presented in the form of a table for all service plans. The Bureau has removed the proposed requirement that the table be substantially similar to proposed Sample Form A-10(g) and has also removed that proposed sample form from the final rule. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(4) and § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(A) above, the final rule does not impose a substantially similar requirement for the sample form for the long form disclosure, unlike the model forms for the short form disclosures. This is because unlike the short form disclosure, the comprehensive content of the long form, together with the wide variety of fees, fee types, and conditions under which those fees are imposed across financial institutions, is not suitable for a strictly standardized content and format design. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of <em data-original="E-03">Appendix A-10 Model Forms and Sample Forms for Financial Institutions Offering Prepaid Accounts (§§ 1005.15(c) and 1005.18(b))</em> below, to provide more flexibility to industry, the Bureau is not providing a sample form for a long form disclosure with multiple service plans. The Bureau notes that Sample Form A-10(f) provides an example of a tabular format for the long form disclosure.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(2) Short Form Disclosure for Multiple Service Plans</title>
      <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting the portion of proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) that addressed the option to use a modified short form to disclose multiple service plans, renumbered § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), with certain modifications as described below for clarity. In addition, for the reasons set forth below, the Bureau has modified comment 18(b)(3)(iii)(B)-1, renumbered as comment 18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>)-1. The Bureau has also made other technical modifications for conformity.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) provides that, as an alternative to disclosing the default service plan pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>), when a financial institution offers multiple service plans within a particular prepaid account program and each plan has a different fee schedule, fee disclosures required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (vii) and (ix) may be provided in the form of a table with separate columns for each service plan in a form substantially similar to Model Form A-10(e). Column headings must describe each service plan included in the table, using the terms “Pay-as-you-go plan,” “Monthly plan,” “Annual Plan,” or substantially similar terms. For multiple service plans offering preferred rates or fees for the prepaid accounts of consumers who also use another non-prepaid service, column headings must describe each service plan included in the table for the preferred- and non-preferred service plans, as applicable.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has substantially redesigned the multiple service plan short form disclosure in order to address many of the concerns raised by consumer group commenters as described above. The short form disclosure for multiple service plans includes the following changes: Expansion of the multi-columned table to disclose all required fees pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (vii) and (ix) together, rather than separating out fees that vary across plans from fees that do not; use of bold-face type for the fees listed pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (iv) to mirror the general short form disclosure's emphasis on the top-line fees; and addition of rows to separately disclose the two-tier fees for in-network and out-of-network ATM withdrawals and balance inquiries. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> Model Form A-10(f).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing indicated that the redesigned short form disclosure for multiple service plans markedly improved the disclosure's usability. Participants were able to navigate a prototype short form disclosure for multiple service plans and to use the disclosure to find specific information about particular plans. Moreover, the relative complexity of the form, although off-putting to some participants, did not appear to alter testing results.<footnote ref="459">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report II at 16 and 26-27.</footnote>
             Most participants quickly understood that the columns in the table represented different potential fee plans and all were generally able to compare fees in that form with the fees in a general short form disclosure. In light of comments received on the proposed version of the multiple service plan short form and the results of the Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing of the redesigned form, the Bureau is finalizing the rule permitting use of a short form disclosure for multiple service plans.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau recognizes that financial institutions offering multiple service plans may not have a default plan or may find a requirement to disclose only a short form for the default plan overly restrictive and choose instead to discontinue their multiple service plan programs. The Bureau does not intend to disfavor any prepaid account program over another in its rule and seeks to avoid potential disruption to prepaid account programs offering multiple service plans. While the Bureau acknowledges that the relative complexity and density of the multiple service plan short form disclosure may render it somewhat less consumer friendly than the general short form disclosure, the Bureau believes the redesigned form will provide financial institutions with flexibility to accommodate disclosure of products with multiple service plans, while also retaining much of the standardization of the short form design that facilitates comprehension and comparison shopping for consumers.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As referenced above, the rule sets forth specific requirements for the column headings required to describe each service plan. The Bureau is finalizing the proposed requirement to use the terms “Pay-as-you-go plan,” “Monthly plan,” “Annual Plan,” or substantially similar terms. To illustrate, final comment 18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>)-1 states that, for example, a financial institution that offers a prepaid account program with one service plan for which a consumer pays no periodic fee but instead pays a fee for each transaction, and another plan that includes a monthly fee but no per transaction fee, may use the short form disclosure for multiple service plans pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As noted above, some industry commenters requested that the Bureau allow use of the multiple service plan short form for loyalty plans; this issue was addressed in proposed comment 18(b)(3)(iii)(B)-1. For clarity, the Bureau has addressed use of the multiple service plan short form for loyalty plans in the regulatory text of the final rule as described above. Final comment 18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>)-1 reiterates that a financial institution that offers a prepaid account program with preferred rates or fees for the prepaid accounts of consumers who also use another non-prepaid service (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> a mobile phone service), often referred to as “loyalty plans,” may also use the short form disclosure for multiple service plans pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>). The comment also explains that pricing variations based on whether a consumer elects to use a specific feature of a prepaid account, such as waiver of the monthly fee for consumers electing to receive direct deposit, does not constitute a loyalty plan. Final comment 18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>)-1 also cross-references final comment 18(b)(3)(iii)-1.ii for guidance on how to provide a single disclosure for like fees for multiple service plan short form disclosures.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>2(b)(3)(i)</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.2(b)(3)(i) would have defined the term prepaid account as a card, code, or other device, not otherwise an account under § 1005.2(b)(1), that was established primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, and that satisfied three additional criteria as to how the account was loaded and used, as laid out in proposed § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(A) through (C), which are discussed separately below. This proposed definition of prepaid account was based on the formulation for the definition of general-use prepaid card in the Gift Card Rule (§ 1005.20). Proposed comment 2(b)(3)(i)-1 would have clarified that for purposes of subpart A of Regulation E, except for § 1005.17 (requirements for overdraft services), the term “debit card” also included a prepaid card. Proposed comment 2(b)(3)(i)-2 would have explained that proposed § 1005.2(b)(3) applied only to cards, codes, or other devices that were acquired by or provided to a consumer primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. For further guidance interpreting the phrase “card, code, or other device,” proposed comment 2(b)(3)(i)-2 would have referred to existing comments 20(a)-4 and -5.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received comment from an industry trade association asserting that defining a prepaid account as a “card, code, or other device” may conflate the actual covered account with the access device that the consumer can use to transact or withdraw from that account. Upon further consideration, the Bureau has revised § 1005.2(b)(3)(i) to remove the phrase “card, code, or other device,” so that the definition does not conflate the access device that may be used to access the underlying account with the account itself. The Bureau intends the definition of prepaid account to cover the account itself, not the device used to access it.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has also removed the reference to the prepaid account being an account that is “not otherwise an account under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.” As discussed below, the prepaid account definition's interaction with the existing definition of account in Regulation E is now addressed in other paragraphs of final § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D). Specifically, excluded from the definition of prepaid account by new § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>) are checking accounts, share draft accounts, and NOW accounts, while commentary to final § 1005.2(b)(3)(i) clarifies that other types of accounts, such as savings accounts, are excluded from the definition of prepaid account because they do not have the same primary functions.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has revised comment 2(b)(3)(i)-1 to state that for purposes of subpart A of Regulation E, unless where otherwise specified, the term debit card also includes a prepaid card. The Bureau has removed the proposed reference to § 1005.17 in this paragraph, as the Bureau's revisions to § 1005.17, discussed below, have rendered its reference here unnecessary.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau has also removed the phrase “established primarily for personal, family, or household purposes” from the definition of prepaid account. Upon further consideration, the Bureau believes that phrase is unnecessary here as it already appears in the main definition of account in § 1005.2(b)(1), and prepaid accounts are expressly included as a subcategory within that broader definition. The Bureau has likewise removed proposed comment 2(b)(3)(i)-2, which would have provided guidance with respect to the meaning of “established primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.”</analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(b)(1)(ii) Disclosures for Prepaid Accounts Acquired in Retail Locations</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed an adjustment to the general pre-acquisition timing requirement where consumers acquired prepaid accounts in retail stores. Proposed § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii) would have permitted financial institutions to employ an alternative method of delivering the long form disclosure. Under this alternative timing regime, a financial institution would have been permitted to provide the long form disclosure in writing after the consumer acquired a prepaid account as long as three conditions were met, as discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In the proposal, the Bureau stated its belief that in many cases it was not feasible for financial institutions that offered prepaid accounts in retail stores to provide printed long form disclosures prior to acquisition. For example, due to size and space limitations on standard J-hook display racks, the Bureau believed that many financial institutions would not have been able to present both the short form and long form disclosures required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) and (ii) on the packaging without overhauling the packaging's design or otherwise adjusting the relevant retail space.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Nevertheless, the Bureau believed it was important that consumers be provided an opportunity to review both the short form and long form disclosures before acquisition. Thus, proposed § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii) would have permitted a financial institution to provide the long form disclosure after a consumer acquired a prepaid account in person in a retail store, as long as three conditions were met. Proposed § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii)(A) would have set forth the first condition: That the access device for the prepaid account available for sale in a retail store had to be inside of a packaging material. This condition would have applied even if the product, when sold, was only a temporary access device. Proposed § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii)(B) would have set forth the second condition: That the short form disclosures required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) had to be provided on or be visible through an outward-facing, external surface of a prepaid account access device's packaging material in the tabular format described in proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(iii). The Bureau believed that financial institutions offering the majority of current prepaid accounts at retail would be able to satisfy this condition without altering the structure of the existing packaging.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The third condition, set forth in proposed § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii)(C), would have required that a financial institution include the telephone number and URL a consumer could use to access the long form disclosure while in a retail store on the short form disclosure, as required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">11</em>). The Bureau believed that consumers should at least be able to access the long form disclosure by telephone or via a Web site, should they want to obtain comprehensive fee information. The Bureau believed that many consumers had the ability to access a Web site through the URL that would be listed on the short form disclosure when shopping for a prepaid account, but nonetheless also proposed that when a financial institution did not disclose the long form disclosure before a consumer acquired a prepaid account, the financial institution had to also make the long form disclosure available to a consumer by telephone. The Bureau acknowledged that it might be complicated for financial institutions to provide the long form disclosure by telephone. Further, the Bureau acknowledged that it may be harder for a consumer to understand the information in the long form disclosure when delivered orally. Nevertheless, the Bureau believed that if a consumer took the affirmative step to request additional information about a prepaid account by telephone when shopping in a retail store, it may have been more likely that the consumer was seeking out specific information not included on the short form disclosure, and that such a consumer would therefore be less likely to suffer from information overload.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 18(b)(1)(ii)-1 would have provided guidance on the definition of retail store. Specifically, proposed comment 18(b)(1)(ii)-1 would have explained that, for purposes of the proposed requirements of § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii), a retail store was a location where a consumer could obtain a prepaid account in person and that was operated by an entity other than a financial institution or an agent of the financial institution. Proposed comment 18(b)(1)(ii)-1 would have further clarified that a bank or credit union branch was not a retail store, but that drug stores and grocery stores at which a consumer can acquire a prepaid account could be retail stores. Proposed comment 18(b)(1)(ii)-1 would have also clarified that a retail store that offered one financial institution's prepaid account products exclusively would be considered an agent of the financial institution, and, thus, both the short form and the long form disclosure would need to be provided pre-acquisition pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(1)(i) in such settings.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believed that if a financial institution was the sole provider of prepaid accounts in a given retail store, or was otherwise an agent of the financial institution, then it would be easier for the financial institution to manage the distribution of disclosures to consumers. The Bureau believed that financial institutions with such exclusive relationships should have fewer hurdles to providing both the short form and long form disclosures to a consumer before acquisition. Nevertheless, the Bureau sought comment on whether agents of the financial institution faced space constraints in retail stores that would have made it difficult to provide the short form and long form disclosures pre-acquisition.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 18(b)(1)(ii)-2 would have explained that disclosures were considered to have been provided post-acquisition if they were inside the packaging material accompanying a prepaid account access device that a consumer could not see or access before acquiring the prepaid account, or if it was not readily apparent to a consumer that he or she had the ability to access the disclosures inside of the packaging material. Proposed comment 18(b)(1)(ii)-2 would also provide the example that if the packaging material is presented in a way that consumers would assume they must purchase the prepaid account before they can open the packaging material, the financial institution would be deemed to have provided disclosures post-acquisition.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 18(b)(1)(ii)-3 would have explained that a payroll card account offered to and accepted by consumers working in retail stores would not have been considered a prepaid account acquired in a retail store for purposes of proposed § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii), and thus, a consumer would have had to receive the short form and long form disclosures pre-acquisition pursuant to the timing requirement set forth in proposed § 1005.18(b)(1)(i). The Bureau explained that it did not believe that there were space constraints involved in offering payroll card accounts to retail store employees. Finally, proposed comment 18(b)(1)(ii)-4 would have clarified that pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii)(C), a financial institution could make the long form accessible to a consumer by telephone and by a Web site by, for example, providing the long form disclosure by telephone using an interactive voice response system or by using a customer service agent.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters overwhelmingly supported the proposed retail store exception. Despite this general support, however, a large number of industry commenters, including issuing banks, program managers, trade associations, a payment network, and an advocacy organization advocating on behalf of business interests, generally opposed the proposition that neither financial institutions nor their agents could qualify for the proposed retail store exception. These commenters argued that the exclusion of financial institutions and their agents was unnecessary and did not reflect compliance and market realities. Specifically, the commenters asserted that the location of acquisition should not dictate the type of disclosure the consumer receive since, they said, the constraints of providing the long form disclosure in any in-person environment are the same. Thus, they argued, there is no basis for distinguishing between large retailers that carry multiple prepaid account programs and small retailers, who may have no choice but to carry only one financial institution's products, nor between retail stores and bank and credit union branches who may also sell prepaid accounts on J-hooks or in J-hook-style packaging. One program manager argued that the Bureau's failure to distinguish in this context between banks that issue prepaid accounts and smaller financial institutions, like credit unions or smaller banks, that only sell prepaid accounts issued by others, is inequitable in that it places a greater compliance burden on smaller institutions than comparable retailers would face. These commenters urged the Bureau to expand the application of the retail store exception to more or all in-person sales of prepaid accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A subset of these commenters objected specifically to the proposed commentary stating that an entity is an agent of the financial institution for purposes of proposed § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii) if it exclusively sells one financial institution's prepaid account products. These commenters argued that agency status should be an issue determined under State law. They explained that, under several States' laws, a financial institution must appoint any store that sells its products as its agent, which would make such store ineligible for the retail store exception as proposed. Commenters also argued that the exclusive retailer exclusion would be difficult to enforce. For example, they noted that retailers may not be aware that they were selling prepaid accounts from only one financial institution, especially as retailers often deal with a program manager rather than directly with the financial institution itself. The commenters also listed several circumstances under which a retail store could unwittingly become disqualified from the proposed retail store exception by inadvertently offering only that financial institution's prepaid accounts, including, for example, if a retail store offers two financial institutions' prepaid accounts, but the supply of one financial institution's products runs out.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Few consumer groups commented on this issue, but those that did, along with the office of a State Attorney General, opposed the retail store exception generally. They urged the Bureau to instead require that the long form disclosure be provided prior to acquisition in all scenarios because, they argued, consumers are more likely to pay attention to information disclosed on a physical form than on a Web site. They further noted that financial institutions could develop viable alternative disclosure methods that would allow them to disclose physical copies of both the short form and the long form prior to acquisition as part of the prepaid card package—for example, the long form could be disclosed under a flap that could be secured to the package with a Velcro tab. These commenters did not comment, however, on the types of entities that should qualify for the retail store exception if the Bureau were to adopt such a regime in the final rule.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii) with modifications to the situations that qualify for the alternative timing regime for delivery of the long form disclosure for prepaid accounts sold at retail. In general, under the final rule, the alternative timing regime applies when a consumer acquires a prepaid account in person at a retail <em data-original="E-03">location,</em> without regard to whether the location is operated by an agent of the financial institution. The final rule also clarifies, however, that financial institutions selling prepaid accounts in their own branches qualify for the exception only with respect to prepaid accounts that they do not themselves issue. Finally, the Bureau has made several minor revisions to § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii) and its commentary for clarity and consistency.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has considered whether, as some consumer group commenters suggested, it might be more beneficial for consumers to see all of a prepaid account's fees pre-acquisition for prepaid accounts in all acquisition scenarios including at retail to avoid putting the burden on consumers to seek out additional information. The Bureau declines, however, to revise the proposed alternative timing regime for prepaid accounts sold at retail in this way, for the reasons discussed below. The Bureau also declines to permit post-acquisition disclosure of the long form in all in-person acquisition scenarios, as some industry commenters requested.
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau continues to believe that consumers benefit from receiving both the short form and the long form disclosures in writing prior to acquisition, because the disclosures serve different but complementary goals. See the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b) above for a detailed discussion of the reasons the Bureau is generally requiring that financial institutions provide both the short form and the long form disclosures pre-acquisition.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>However, the Bureau is cognizant of the potentially significant cost to industry of providing the long form disclosure prior to acquisition at retail and the packaging adjustments that including such a disclosure would likely require based on the space constraints for products sold at retail. Specifically, commenters have confirmed the Bureau's understanding that, if it were to finalize a requirement that the long form disclosure be provided in writing prior to acquisition of a prepaid account in a retail environment, financial institutions would have to undertake a significant overhaul of current packaging designs.<footnote ref="383">As some consumer group commenters recognized, the only way a printed long form could be incorporated into the current packaging design is by adding additional material and functionality to the package. As the Bureau noted in the proposal, adding material to prepaid card packaging could limit the number of packages retailers could sell on J-hook displays. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 79 FR 77102, 77153 (Dec. 23, 2014).</footnote>
             As such, the Bureau continues to believe that such packaging adjustments would result in significant expense to industry and would likely increase the cost of prepaid accounts and limit the diversity of options available to consumers shopping for prepaid accounts at retail (assuming retailers maintain the same overall space for the display and sale of all prepaid accounts that they have now).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>To balance these considerations, the Bureau has revised § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii) and its commentary to broaden in certain respects the type of entity that qualifies for the retail location exception set forth in § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii). Under final § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii), therefore, a financial institution is not required to provide the long form disclosures before a consumer acquires a prepaid account in person at a retail location; provided the following conditions are met: (A) The prepaid account access device is contained inside the packaging material; (B) the short form disclosures are provided on or are visible through an outward-facing, external surface of a prepaid account access device's packaging material; (C) the short form disclosures include the information set forth in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiii) that allows a consumer to access the long form disclosure by telephone and via a Web site; and (D) the long form disclosures are provided after the consumer acquires the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is persuaded that, in certain cases, the constraints that apply in retail stores—limited space, distribution of disclosures by someone other than the financial institution that issues the prepaid account—could also apply in the context of other in-person acquisition scenarios, such as in the branches of banks and credit unions that sell another financial institution's prepaid accounts. Accordingly, the Bureau is revising § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii) and its commentary to broaden the scope of the retail exception by referring to a retail <em data-original="E-03">location</em> rather than a retail <em data-original="E-03">store.</em> The Bureau does not believe that this shift in approach undermines the consumer protections offered by the Bureau's pre-acquisition disclosure regime generally. Rather, the Bureau continues to believe that its alternative timing regime, with certain modifications described below, strikes an appropriate balance by providing consumers with—or with access to—important disclosures before acquiring a prepaid account while recognizing the packaging and other constraints faced by financial institutions when selling prepaid accounts at retail. Further, the Bureau notes that the conditions placed on a financial institution's ability to use the exemption—including that the short form disclosure appear on the outside of the packaging containing the card and list a telephone number and Web site URL the consumer can use to access the long form disclosure <footnote ref="384">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; final § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii)(A) through (D).</footnote>
            —should ensure that most consumers have access to comprehensive fee information while they shop.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has revised comment 18(b)(1)(ii)-1 to remove the commentary stating that a retail store must be operated by an entity other than a financial institution or a financial institution's agent, and giving specific examples of what type of entities would or would not qualify as retail stores. Instead, final comment 18(b)(1)(ii)-1 states that, for purposes of final § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii), a retail location is a store or other physical site where a consumer can purchase a prepaid account in person and that is operated by an entity other than the financial institution that issues the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau continues to believe, however, that a financial institution selling its own prepaid accounts does not face the same challenges as in other retail locations, and in particular that it is far less difficult for such a financial institution to manage the distribution of disclosures to consumers. In addition, the Bureau believes it is unlikely that any financial institution selling its own prepaid accounts in its own branches also offers prepaid accounts issued by other financial institutions. The Bureau also understands, as stated in the proposal, that financial institutions selling their own prepaid accounts may be less dependent on the J-hook infrastructure to market their products to consumers. Thus, the Bureau believes it is still appropriate to exclude from the retail location exception financial institutions that sell their own prepaid accounts. Accordingly, the Bureau has revised comment 18(b)(1)(ii)-1 to clarify that a branch of a financial institution that offers its own prepaid accounts is not a retail location with respect to those accounts and, thus, both the short form and the long form disclosure must be provided pre-acquisition pursuant to the timing requirements set forth in final § 1005.18(b)(1)(i).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Next, the Bureau is adopting new § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii)(D) to make clear that, to qualify for the retail location exception, the financial institution must provide the long form disclosure after the consumer acquires the prepaid account. Proposed § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii) would have permitted a financial institution, under certain conditions, to provide the long form disclosure after acquisition, but left open a possible interpretation that the financial institution could forego delivering the long form disclosure altogether, which was not the Bureau's intent. For clarity, therefore, the Bureau is adopting § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii)(D) to make delivery of the long form disclosure after acquisition an explicit requirement in § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii). The new provision does not set forth a specific time by which the long form disclosure must be provided after acquisition. In practice, however, the Bureau expects that compliance with final § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii)(D) will typically be accomplished in conjunction with compliance with final § 1005.18(f)(1), which provides that a financial institution must include, as part of the initial disclosures given pursuant to § 1005.7, all of the disclosures required by § 1005.18(b)(4). The initial disclosures required by § 1005.7 must be provided prior to a consumer contracting for an EFT service or before the first EFT involving the account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Relatedly, the Bureau has removed the portion of proposed comment 18(b)(1)(ii)-2 that would have provided an example of when prepaid disclosures provided inside packaging material are provided post-acquisition, because it believes the other provisions of the rule make clear that, other than as set forth in the retail location exception in § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii), the short form and long form disclosures must both be provided to a consumer prior to acquiring the prepaid account. The Bureau is otherwise finalizing comment 18(b)(1)(ii)-2, as well as comments 18(b)(1)(ii)-3 and -4, generally as proposed with minor modifications for clarity and consistency, as well as conforming changes to reflect the numbering changes elsewhere in § 1005.18(b).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>36(d) Additional Requirements for Subsequent Preauthorized Remittance Transfers</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Under the February Final Rule, remittance transfer providers are required to provide senders with both a pre-payment disclosure and a receipt for each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer in a series. Specifically, the pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent transfer must be provided within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of the transfer, and the receipt for each subsequent transfer generally must be provided no later than one business day after the date on which the transfer is made. As discussed above, however, the Bureau is concerned with balancing the interest of consumers in receiving timely disclosures for subsequent transfers with the interests of industry in reducing risks and developing this market segment. Thus, in the February Proposal, the Bureau sought comment on a number of issues related to subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers, including whether senders should receive disclosures for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers and, if so, what form those disclosures should take. 77 FR 6310, 6223. The February Proposal also sought comment on what cancellation rules should apply to these transfers and when those rules should be disclosed to senders.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received few comments in response to its inquiry regarding disclosure of cancellation requirements for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. Among those received, there was little consensus regarding how cancellation rights for subsequent preauthorized transfers should be disclosed. One industry commenter advocated for flexibility on the disclosure requirements to minimize costs. Another industry commenter asserted that the cancellation rights should be included only in the first pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent transfer, while a consumer group commenter posited that a subsequent pre-payment disclosure disclosing cancellation rights should be sent before each subsequent transfer. Only one industry commenter supported including the statement regarding cancellation rights for the next scheduled transfer on the current receipt, arguing that it would give senders more time to cancel the transfer than if the cancellation rights were included in a pre-payment disclosure provided before the subsequent transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Having eliminated the pre-payment disclosure requirement for subsequent transfers and altered the requirements for when a receipt would have to be provided for a subsequent transfer in the final rule, the Bureau is concerned that senders may not receive adequate and timely information regarding the dates of upcoming transfers and, thus, may not know when their right to cancel those transfers expires. Further, as discussed above regarding § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii), even when senders receive disclosures regarding their cancellation rights, they may not have the type of information needed to determine the date on which the right to cancel a subsequent transfer expires. The Bureau is also concerned that, where senders receive a number of receipts in close proximity to one another as part of a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, senders may not have information that would be helpful in distinguishing to which transfer a particular receipt applies.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, to further the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to adopt a new § 1005.36(d), which amends the disclosure requirements for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. Section 1005.36(d)(1)(i) states that, for any subsequent transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the remittance transfer provider must disclose to the sender: (A) the date the provider will make the subsequent transfer, using the term “Future Transfer Date,” or a substantially similar term; (B) a statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation as described in § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv); and (C) the name, telephone number(s), and Web site of the remittance transfer provider. Section 1005.36(d)(1)(ii) states that if the future date or dates of transfer required to be disclosed by this paragraph are described as occurring in regular periodic intervals, <em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> the 15th of every month, rather than as a specific calendar date or dates, the remittance transfer provider must disclose any future date or dates of transfer that do not conform to the described interval.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.36(d)(2)(i) establishes the general timing requirements for disclosures required by § 1005.36(d)(1), stating that, except as described in § 1005.36(d)(2)(ii), the disclosures required by § 1005.36(d)(1) must be received by the sender no more than 12 months, and no less than five business days prior to the date of any subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer to which it pertains. Section 1005.36(d)(2)(i) also states that the disclosures required by § 1005.36(d)(1) may be provided in a separate disclosure or on one or more disclosures required by subpart B related to the same series of preauthorized remittance transfers, so long as the consumer receives the required information for each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer in accordance with the timing requirements of § 1005.36(d)(2)(i).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that information regarding cancellation rights is as important to subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers as it is to other transfers. Accordingly, as noted in the discussion regarding § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii), senders need the date of transfer to determine, among other things, when the cancellation period for a certain preauthorized transfer expires. At the same time, the Bureau recognizes that when authorizing a preauthorized remittance transfer, the sender establishes a recurring schedule. The Bureau believes the repetitive and cyclical nature of preauthorized remittance transfers reduces the need for senders to receive notice of the cancellation period in individual notices sent immediately before each subsequent transfer, and warrants additional flexibility to remittance transfer providers to determine the timing and type of disclosure to be used to advise senders of their cancellation rights for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. The Bureau notes, however, that such notices must be provided within a timeframe that would be useful to senders and is concerned that a notice provided more than 12 months before the date of such transfers would likely be unhelpful to senders. Likewise, a notice received fewer than five business days before the date of transfer may not provide the sender with enough time to determine whether cancellation is warranted and, thus, would also not be helpful to senders.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also recognizes that for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers scheduled four or fewer business days before the date of the transfer, remittance transfer providers will be unable to provide the disclosures regarding the future date of transfer and cancellation rights five or more business days before the date of transfer. Accordingly, § 1005.36(d)(2)(ii) states that for any preauthorized remittance transfer for which the date of transfer is four or fewer business days after the date payment is made for that transfer, the information required by § 1005.36(d)(1) must be provided on or with the receipt described in § 1005.31(b)(2), or disclosed as permitted by § 1005.31(a)(3) and (a)(5), for the initial transfer in that series in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(1)(i). For example, if, on Monday, a sender authorizes a series of preauthorized remittance transfers in which the initial transfer occurs that day and the first subsequent transfer is scheduled to occur on Wednesday, the 30-minute cancellation period under § 1005.34(a) would apply to both transfers. If, however, in the same series of preauthorized remittance transfers the second subsequent remittance transfer is scheduled to occur on Friday, the three-business-day cancellation period would apply to that transfer. For either subsequent transfer, the provider would be unable to provide the required information at least five business days before the date of the transfer. In that instance, the provider would be required to disclose the cancellation period and future date of transfer for the subsequent remittance transfer on or with the receipt provided for the initial preauthorized remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As a result, preauthorized remittance transfers scheduled fewer than three business days from the date of the transfer are now subject to different disclosure requirements than standalone remittance transfers scheduled fewer than three business days from the date of the transfer. With respect to the latter, there is no requirement to disclose the date of transfer or future date of transfer on receipts. The Bureau, however, believes these two sets of transfers present different concerns warranting different treatment. Preauthorized remittance transfers by definition are authorized to recur at substantially regular intervals. As a result, as discussed above, preauthorized remittance transfer present a higher risk of confusion since, depending on the frequency of the subsequent transfers in the series, senders may receive multiple receipts at or around the same time and, absent identifying information such as the date of transfer, may be unable to identify the transfer to which a particular receipt applies. One-time transfers scheduled in advance do not generally present the same risks because in most instances the sender would schedule a single transfer at any given time as opposed to a series of transfers and should not have difficulty identifying the transfer to which the receipt applies. Further, if disclosures were only required for subsequent preauthorized transfers occurring at least three business days in the future, consumers may mistakenly believe that no transfers were scheduled on any days prior to that time.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Thus, while the Bureau believes the date of transfer would be helpful to senders of preauthorized remittance transfers, it does not believe such information is necessary for standalone transfers scheduled fewer than three business days from the date of the transfer. As stated above, the Bureau believes that it will be simpler for remittance transfer providers to program their receipts to include the transfer date information consistently for preauthorized transfers than to create separate receipt forms for one-time and preauthorized remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New § 1005.36(d)(3) and (d)(4) address formatting and accuracy requirements for disclosures required under § 1005.36(d)(3). Section 1005.36(d)(3) states that the information required by § 1005.36(d)(1)(i)(A) generally must be disclosed in close proximity to the other information required by § 1005.36(d)(1)(i)(B). Section 1005.36(d)(4) states that any disclosure required by § 1005.36(d)(1) must be accurate as of the date the subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer to which it pertains is made.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adopting commentary to provide further guidance on the application of § 1005.36(d). Comment 36(d)-1 clarifies that § 1005.36(d)(2) permits remittance transfer providers some flexibility in determining how and when the disclosures required by § 1005.36(d)(1) may be provided to senders. Comment 36(d)-1 states that the disclosure may be provided as a separate disclosure, or on or with any other disclosures required by subpart B of Regulation E related to the same series of preauthorized remittance transfers, provided that the disclosure and timing requirements in § 1005.36(d)(2) and other applicable provisions in subpart B are satisfied. For example, the required disclosures may be made on or with a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i); a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(2)(ii); or in a separate disclosure created by the provider. The comment also provides a fact pattern describing how a remittance transfer provider would comply with § 1005.36(d)(1).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Comment 36(d)-2 clarifies that § 1005.36(d)(2)(i) requires that the sender receive disclosure of the date of transfer, applicable cancellation requirements, and the provider's contact information no more than 12 months and no less than 5 business days prior to the date of the subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer. Comment 36(d)-2 also cross-references comment 36(a)(2)-3 for purposes of determining when a disclosure required by § 1005.36(d)(1) is received by the sender.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Comment 36(d)-3 provides guidance on how the remittance transfer provider should disclose the date of transfer. Specifically, comment 36(d)-3 clarifies that the date of transfer of a subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer may be disclosed either as a specific date (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> July 19, 2013), or by using a method that clearly permits identification of the date of transfer, such as periodic intervals (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> the third Monday of every month, or the 15th of every month). Comment 36(d)-3 further clarifies that if the future dates of transfer are disclosed as occurring periodically and there is a break in the sequence, or the date of transfer does not conform to the described period, <em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> if a weekend or holiday causes the provider to deviate from the normal schedule, the provider should disclose the specific date of transfer for the affected transfer. Finally, comment 36(d)-4 clarifies the accuracy requirements for disclosures required by § 1005.36(d)(1). Comment 36(d)-4 explains that if any of the information required by § 1005.36(d)(1) changes, the provider must provide an updated disclosure with the revised information that is accurate as of when the transfer is made, pursuant to § 1005.36(d)(2).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Comment 31(b)(1)-1 Fees and Taxes</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(1)-1 to the 2012 Final Rule provides general guidance on the disclosure of fees and taxes.  Comment 31(b)(1)-1.i explains that taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the remittance transfer provider, which are required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii), include taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a State or other governmental body, and comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii focuses more specifically on how to disclose fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider as required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In the December Proposal, the Bureau proposed additional clarification on other types of recipient institution fees that are, or are not, specifically related to a remittance transfer.  For organizational purposes, the December Proposal divided comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii into new proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii through -1.v.  Specifically, proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii would have contrasted the fees and taxes required to be disclosed by § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) and the fees and taxes required to be disclosed by § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi).  Proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.iii would have revised the reference to taxes imposed by a foreign government to taxes imposed by a foreign country's central government, and the proposed commentary would have built on the existing guidance regarding applicable recipient institution fees to clarify that account fees are not specifically related to a remittance transfer if such fees are merely assessed based on general account activity and not for receiving transfers.  Proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.iv additionally would have explained that a fee that specifically relates to a remittance transfer may be structured on a flat per-transaction basis, or may be conditioned on other factors (such as account status or the quantity of remittance transfers received) in addition to on the remittance transfer itself.  Proposed 31(b)(1)-1.v would have provided that the terms used to describe the fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider in § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) and imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) must differentiate between such fees and taxes. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Insofar as the Bureau is eliminating the requirement to disclose non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, the Bureau is not adopting the proposed revisions to comments 31(b)(1)-1.ii.  Instead, applicable examples concerning the types of fees related to a remittance transfer that must be disclosed have been moved to the commentary to § 1005.30(h), as discussed above. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 30(h)-1.  The Bureau is, however, modifying certain aspects of the remaining commentary in light of the new definitions and the elimination of the requirement to disclose taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider.  In comment 31(b)(1)-1.i of the 2013 Final Rule, the reference to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) is removed to focus on the scope of fees imposed or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by the provider that are required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii).  The Bureau is also revising comments 31(b)(1)-1.ii, 31(b)(1)-2, and 31(b)(1)-3 of the 2013 Final Rule commentary consistent with new scope of the required disclosures and the movement of certain commentary to 30(h).

Proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">11</em>) would have required this disclosure only when a financial institution chose not to provide a written form of the long form disclosure that would have been required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii) before a consumer acquires a prepaid account at a retail store as described in proposed § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii). (Proposed Model Forms A-10(a) and (b) also included this language for government benefit accounts and payroll card accounts.) The Bureau believed that using either the telephone number or the Web site, a consumer would be able to access information about the fees listed in the long form disclosure, and any conditions on the applicability of those fees. As discussed in the proposal, the Bureau believed that if consumers do not receive the long form disclosure in writing or by email before acquisition in a retail store, it is important that they are still able to access the information. The Bureau also believed it is important that the Web site URL be unique to ensure that a consumer can directly access the same type of stand-alone long form disclosure that would otherwise be provided pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(1)(i) in written or electronic form before a consumer acquires a prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">11</em>)-1 would have provided further details about the telephone number that would have been required to be included on the short form disclosure pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">11</em>) when a financial institution does not provide the long form disclosure before a consumer acquires a prepaid account. The proposed comment would have clarified that, for example, a financial institution could use a customer service agent or an interactive voice response system, to provide this disclosure. Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">11</em>)-1 would have also explained that a consumer must not incur a fee to call this telephone number before acquiring a prepaid account. The telephone number disclosed pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">11</em>) could be the same as the customer service number for which a financial institution may impose a fee on a consumer to use for other purposes, but a consumer could not incur any customer service or other transaction fees when calling this number to access the information set forth in proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii) before acquiring a prepaid account in retail store.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau considered requiring that this number be toll-free, but ultimately decided that having a toll-free number is less important to consumers, most of whom use mobile phones and do not incur additional fees for making long distance calls, and such a requirement could impose a burden on smaller financial institutions because they would perhaps have to maintain a separate toll-free line just for their prepaid account products. The Bureau noted that some card networks may require financial institutions to maintain toll-free lines, and therefore believed that telephone numbers disclosed in such cases would likely be toll-free.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">11</em>)-2 would have provided further details about the Web site that would have been required to be included on the short form disclosure pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">11</em>) when a financial institution does not provide the long form disclosure before a consumer acquires a prepaid account. The proposed comment would have clarified that an entered URL that requires a consumer to navigate various other Web pages before viewing the long form disclosure would not comply with proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">11</em>). The Bureau believed that consumers make acquisition decisions in retail stores relatively quickly—often while standing—and should not have to navigate different links to access the Web page that contains the long form disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Relatedly, proposed § 1005.18(b)(4)(i)(A) would have required, among other things, that the URL disclosed pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">11</em>) must not exceed 22 characters and must be meaningfully named. The Bureau explained that by meaningfully named, it meant a Web site URL that uses real words or phrases, particularly those related to the actual prepaid account product. The Bureau believed 22 characters is the maximum length of a Web site URL that can fit legibly on a short form disclosure on most existing retail packaging material. The Bureau further believed these parameters would ensure that a consumer can easily enter the Web site URL listed on the short form into a mobile device when shopping in a retail store in order to access the long form disclosure. Using a meaningfully named Web site URL would also ensure that it is easy for a consumer to understand, which the Bureau believed would increase the likelihood that a consumer would use the URL to seek out more information about a prepaid account product.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also considered whether to require financial institutions to disclose an SMS short code, which might be easier to type than a Web site URL, that consumers could text to receive the Web site URL that links directly to the long form disclosure.<footnote ref="438">An SMS short code is a group of numbers one can send as a text message using a mobile phone and receive a text message in response.</footnote>
             The Bureau decided against including this method because sending a text message using an SMS short code would still require a mobile phone capable of sending text messages, could incur costs for the consumer, and would require adequate reception in the retail location. The Bureau also considered, but did not propose, requiring that a quick response (QR) code be included in the short form but decided against it because a QR code would require a substantial amount of space on the small short form disclosure and QR code adoption remains low. The Bureau did, however, request comment on including SMS and QR codes in the short form disclosure.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received few but varied comments regarding the requirement in proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">11</em>) to disclose a telephone number and Web site URL in the short form disclosure in retail settings so that consumers could access the long form disclosure pre-acquisition. An industry trade association supported the disclosure and recommended it for all short forms, not just those in retail settings, but arguing that inclusion of this information generally would render unnecessary pre-acquisition disclosure of the written long form. A member of a trade association for State government officials generally expressed concern about consumer confusion, positing that a consumer picking up the short form may not realize there is also a long form disclosure. A program manager requested clarification that the telephone number disclosed need not be the same number for all the financial institution's prepaid account programs but rather could correspond to a particular prepaid account program. Two consumer groups and a program manager recommended allowing, but not requiring, disclosure of an SMS or QR code to provide an additional easy method to access the long form disclosure for consumers who have smart phones. An office of a State Attorney General said the Bureau should require that the long form disclosure be provided in written form in all payroll settings as employees may have limited telephone and internet access. (The proposed and final rules, in fact, do require that a long form disclosure be provided pre-acquisition for payroll card accounts.)</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters recommended eliminating the character limit and the “meaningfully named” standard from the Web site URL. Specifically, an industry trade association and an issuing bank said that the limited space of the short form already requires brevity and a program manager said that use of real words and phrases does not mean web addresses will be easier to remember and that many recognizable trademarks and product names do not qualify as real words and phrases.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">11</em>), renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiii), with certain modifications. The Bureau is requiring that all short forms contain a statement directing consumers to the location of the long form disclosure to find details and conditions for all fees and services. For prepaid accounts offered at retail locations, this statement must include a telephone number and a Web site URL, as proposed. For clarity, the Bureau has added to the regulatory text the specific language for this statement. The requirements in proposed § 1005.18(b)(4)(i)(A) that the Web site URL be no more than 22 characters and must be meaningfully named has been relocated to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiii). Also, this provision permits financial institutions to include an SMS code as part of the disclosure. In addition, comments 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">11</em>)-1 and -2, renumbered as 18(b)(2)(xiii)-1 and -2, provide further clarification regarding disclosure of the telephone number and Web site URL. The Bureau has also made technical modifications to the rule and commentary for conformity and clarity.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The final rule requires a statement in the short form disclosure directing the consumer to the location of the long form disclosure required by final § 1005.18(b)(4) to find details and conditions for all fees and services. For financial institutions offering prepaid accounts pursuant to the retail location exception in final § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii), this statement must also include a telephone number and Web site URL that a consumer may use to directly, respectively, access an oral and an electronic version of the long form disclosure required under final § 1005.18(b)(4). The Bureau proposed this exception from the requirement to provide the long form disclosure pre-acquisition at retail in recognition of the space limitations inherent in selling prepaid accounts at retail. However, the Bureau continues to believe it is important for consumers to be able to access the long form disclosure through other modes prior to purchasing a prepaid account at retail. The Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing of the short form disclosure confirmed that nearly all participants understood they could find information about additional fees not disclosed on the prototype short form by visiting the Web site or calling the telephone number on the form.<footnote ref="439">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report II at 12 and 22.</footnote>
             Thus, in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiii), the Bureau has retained the proposed requirement to include in the short form disclosure a telephone number and Web site URL that a consumer may use to access oral and electronic versions of the long form disclosure required by final § 1005.18(b)(4) when the financial institution is offering prepaid accounts at a retail location pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As stated above, the Bureau is finalizing § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiii) to require disclosure in all short forms of a statement directing the consumer to the location of the long form to find details and conditions for all fees and services. Pursuant to the final rule, short form disclosures provided in locations other than retail locations are not required to disclose the additional information of a telephone number or Web site URL. Thus, the proposed disclosure remains the same in the final rule for financial institutions offering prepaid accounts pursuant to the retail location exception in final § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii). The Bureau is adopting the additional requirement that all short form disclosures contain a similar statement directing consumers to the location of the long form disclosure to alert consumers that there is a comprehensive list of fees and information available to them and where to find it in order to help them make prepaid account purchase and use decisions. The location included in the statement required in a non-retail location might be, for example, the cardholder agreement or the Web site URL, or any other location where the consumer can locate the long form disclosure. While the long form disclosure may be readily accessible to consumers along with the short form in certain settings, the amount of information often provided to consumers prior to acquiring a prepaid account in some settings may obfuscate the existence of the more complete long form disclosure. The short form disclosure was designed to be a snapshot of key fees and information; thus it is an optimal place to alert consumers to its companion disclosure, the comprehensive long form. Finally, this change to the proposal helps standardize the short form disclosures, including those provided outside of retail locations, by requiring a parallel disclosure in all short forms directing consumers to the location of the long form disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiii) provides that this disclosure must be made using the following clause or a substantially similar clause: “Find details and conditions for all fees and services in [location]” or, for prepaid accounts offered at retail locations pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii), made using the following clause or a substantially similar clause: “Find details and conditions for all fees and services inside the package, or call [telephone number] or visit [Web site].”</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau declines to follow the recommendation of the commenter that all short forms, not just those provided in retail settings, disclose a telephone number and Web site URL through which to access the long form in lieu of requiring the written long form disclosure be provided pre-acquisition. For a full discussion of the Bureau's rationale for requiring disclosure of both a short form and a long form, see the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b) above. Also, the Bureau believes that providing consumers with written versions of required disclosures that they can keep, without requiring them to have access to the internet and a printer (or a telephone), is superior to limiting consumer access to such disclosures solely through a Web site or telephone number.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has removed the requirement that the Web site URL provided be “unique,” and instead is requiring that both the telephone number and Web site URL provide the consumer with direct access, respectively, to an oral and an electronic version of the long form disclosure. This modification makes explicit the reasoning set forth in the proposed rule that a consumer must not be required to go through excessive steps or have to pay to access the electronic and oral disclosures required under this section. In addition, comments 18(b)(2)(xiii)-1 and -2 provide further clarification of the direct access requirement for telephone number and Web site URL.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In the final rule, the Bureau has also relocated to § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiii) the requirements that the Web site URL not exceed 22 characters and be meaningfully named from its location in proposed § 1005.18(b)(4)(i)(A), to consolidate the requirements regarding this Web site URL in a single place. As discussed above, several industry commenters recommended eliminating the character limit and the “meaningfully named” standard from the Web site URL. The Bureau continues to believe that the character limit and the requirement that Web site URLs be meaningfully named is important for consumer comprehension and ease of use in a retail setting; for these reasons the Bureau is adopting these requirements in the final rule. The Bureau notes that the character limit and the meaningfully named standard are not meant to make the Web site URLs easier for consumers to remember later, but rather are meant to enable consumers to more easily and accurately enter them into a web browser on their mobile phones while in a retail location. The Bureau does not believe that a Web site URL containing a long string of meaningless letters and numbers would facilitate consumer access to the long form disclosure at a retail location. The Bureau is providing clarification in final comment 18(b)(2)(xiii)-2, as discussed below, that trademark and product names and their commonly accepted or readily understandable abbreviations are deemed to comply with the requirement of final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiii) that the Web site URL be meaningfully named.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau is adopting the final rule with the added provision that a financial institution may, but is not required to, disclose an SMS code at the end of the statement disclosing the telephone number and Web site URL, if the SMS code can be accommodated on the same line of text as the statement required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiii). The Bureau agrees with industry and consumer group commenters that consumers could benefit from allowing financial institutions to provide an additional easy method to access the long form disclosure at retail locations. The Bureau believes that an SMS code can fit within the short form disclosure without sacrificing consumer engagement and comprehension. The Bureau is not permitting a QR code to be disclosed in the short form, however, because although potentially useful, a QR code would require a substantial amount of space on the small short form disclosure and, the Bureau believes, QR code adoption continues to remain low.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Final comment 18(b)(2)(xiii)-1 clarifies that, to provide the long form disclosure by telephone, a financial institution could use a live customer service agent or an interactive voice response system. In response to the commenter referenced above, the comment goes on to clarify that a financial institution could use a telephone number specifically dedicated to providing the long form disclosure or a more general customer service telephone number for the prepaid account program. It also provides an example of a financial institution that would be deemed to provide direct access pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiii) if a consumer navigates one or two prompts to reach the oral long form disclosure via a live customer service agent or an interactive voice response system using either a specifically dedicated telephone number or a more general customer service telephone number.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Final comment 18(b)(2)(xiii)-2 provides an example of a financial institution that requires a consumer to navigate various other Web pages before viewing the long form as one that would not be deemed to provide direct access pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiii). The comment also clarifies that trademark and product names and their commonly accepted or readily understandable abbreviations comply with the requirements of final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiii) that the Web site URL be meaningfully named and provides an example.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>2(b)(3) Prepaid Account</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed several changes to § 1005.2(b), as discussed below. In sum, these changes would have created a broad new defined term, “prepaid account,” as a subcategory of the definition of “account” in existing § 1005.2(b)(1), and thus subject to Regulation E. As discussed in detail in the proposal, existing § 1005.2(b)(1) defines an “account” generally for purposes of Regulation E as a demand deposit (checking), savings, or other consumer asset account (other than an occasional or incidental credit balance in a credit plan) held directly or indirectly by a financial institution and established primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. EFTA and existing Regulation E contain explicit provisions applying specifically to payroll card accounts, as well as accounts used for the distribution of government benefits in existing §§ 1005.18 and 1005.15, respectively. Gift cards, although not included in the § 1005.2(b) definition of account, are addressed specifically in § 1005.20. The Board, in adopting rules to include payroll card accounts within the ambit of Regulation E, explicitly stated that Regulation E did not, at that time, cover general spending cards to which a consumer might transfer by direct deposit some portion of the consumer's wages.<footnote ref="286">71 FR 51437, 51441 (Aug. 30, 2006).</footnote>
             As a result, some regulators, the prepaid industry, and others had interpreted Regulation E as not applying to various types of prepaid products that are not payroll card accounts, accounts used for the distribution of government benefits, or gift cards.<footnote ref="287">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; FMS Rule, 75 FR 80335, 80337 (Dec. 22, 2010). However, as evidenced by the Study of Prepaid Account Agreements, many prepaid providers have, for a variety of reasons, elected to apply some or all of Regulation E's provisions (as modified by the Payroll Card Rule) to their non-payroll prepaid products generally.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>After the Bureau assumed authority for implementing most of EFTA pursuant to the transfer of certain authorities from the Board to the Bureau under the Dodd-Frank Act, it analyzed whether other types of prepaid products not already specifically identified in Regulation E could or should be covered by the regulation. It first considered the applicability of EFTA to prepaid products. EFTA, among other things, governs transactions that involve an EFT to or from a consumer's account. It defines an account to be “a demand deposit, savings deposit, or other asset account . . . as described in regulations of the Bureau, established primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.” <footnote ref="288">EFTA section 903(2), 15 U.S.C. 1693a(2).</footnote>
             Insofar as the statute defines account broadly to include any other asset account and for the other reasons discussed below, the Bureau believed it was reasonable to interpret “account” in EFTA to include prepaid accounts. Thus, it proposed to include prepaid accounts expressly within Regulation E's definition of account. To clarify the scope of the proposed rule and to modify Regulation E to reflect the characteristics of prepaid accounts, the Bureau proposed to modify the definition of “account” under § 1005.2(b) to create a specific sub-definition for prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believed that proposing to apply Regulation E to prepaid accounts was appropriate for several reasons. First, it concluded that consumers' use of prepaid products had evolved significantly since 2006, when the Board last examined the issue in the course of its payroll card account rulemaking. The Bureau noted that a substantial number of consumers could and do use prepaid accounts that involve substantial sums of money, in part because many have wages and/or benefits loaded onto prepaid cards through direct deposit.<footnote ref="289">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp., &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;2013 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households,&lt;/em&gt; at 55 (Oct. 2014), &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;available at https://www.fdic.gov/householdsurvey/2013report.pdf&lt;/em&gt; (2013 FDIC Survey) (finding that for households that reloaded prepaid debit cards in the last 12 months, 17.7 percent of all households and 27.7 percent of unbanked households did so via direct deposit of a paycheck).</footnote>
             In addition, consumers use prepaid cards for a variety of purposes, including making purchases, paying bills, and receiving payments.<footnote ref="290">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g., id.&lt;/em&gt; at 48 (finding that for all households that used prepaid debit cards in the last 12 months, 44.5 percent did so to pay for everyday purchases or to pay bills and 19.4 percent did so to receive payments).</footnote>
             Indeed, the Bureau noted that some consumers without other transaction accounts depend on prepaid cards to meet all of their payment account needs.<footnote ref="291">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g., id.&lt;/em&gt; (finding that for unbanked households that used prepaid debit cards in the last 12 months, 65 percent did so to pay for everyday purchases or to pay bills and 41.8 percent did so to receive payments).</footnote>
             As a result, the Bureau believed that such products should be considered consumer asset accounts subject to EFTA and Regulation E.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Second, the Bureau concluded that inclusion aligned appropriately with the purposes of EFTA. The legislative history of EFTA indicates that Congress's primary goal was to protect consumers using EFT services. Although, at the time, providers of electronic payment services argued that enactment of EFTA was premature and that the electronic payment market should be allowed to develop further on its own, Congress believed that establishing a framework of rights and duties for all parties would benefit both consumers and providers. Likewise, in the proposal, the Bureau stated its belief that it was appropriate to establish such a framework for prepaid accounts, because doing so would benefit both consumers and providers.<footnote ref="292">79 FR 77102, 77127 (Dec. 23, 2014).</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, were it to finalize the proposal, the Bureau believed that consumers would be better able to assess the risks of using prepaid products. Indeed, the Bureau was concerned that because prepaid cards could be so similar to credit and debit cards (which are protected under Regulations Z and E), consumers may not realize that their prepaid cards lack the same benefits and protections as those other cards. The Bureau stated its belief that the proposal, if finalized, would serve to make those protections more consistent and eliminate a regulatory gap.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With these considerations in mind, the Bureau proposed to bring a broad range of prepaid products within the ambit of Regulation E and also proposed to modify certain substantive provisions of Regulation E as appropriate for different types of prepaid accounts. To facilitate this, the Bureau proposed to add a definition of “prepaid account,” the specifics of which are discussed in greater detail in the section-by-section analyses that follow, to the existing definition of “account” in § 1005.2(b). In sum, the proposed definition would have created a broad general umbrella definition for prepaid accounts that are issued on a prepaid basis or loaded with funds thereafter and are usable to conduct transactions with merchants or at an ATM, or usable to facilitate P2P transfers. The definition would not have depended on whether such accounts were reloadable or non-reloadable. Payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts would have been subsumed within the broader definition, though still enumerated as specific subcategories for purposes of tailoring certain substantive rules. The Bureau noted that while not all prepaid products covered by the proposed definition could or would be used as full and ongoing transaction account substitutes, it was concerned that to try to carve out very specific types of products that were, or could be, used for short-term limited purposes would create substantial complexity and could result in consumer confusion as to what protections would apply to otherwise indistinguishable products. The proposed definition would have excluded accounts that were already subject to Regulation E.<footnote ref="293">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt; at 77127-28.</footnote>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As with the comments the Bureau received in response to the ANPR, most commenters to the proposal (industry, consumer advocacy groups, and others) did not object to the general concept of bringing prepaid products within the ambit of Regulation E.<footnote ref="294">A trade association representing credit unions asserted that the Bureau lacked the statutory authority to extend Regulation E to GPR cards. The commenter argued that, because Congress expressly exempted GPR cards from the provisions of the Credit CARD Act that apply to gift cards, the Bureau lacks the authority to extend the requirements of all of Regulation E to prepaid cards absent a statutory amendment to EFTA to define “account” to include prepaid cards. The Bureau disagrees. The provisions in the Credit CARD Act that apply to gift cards were specific requirements that Congress mandated for the unique context of gift cards. These provisions do not take away from the Bureau's authority and discretion to regulate accounts more generally under EFTA as a whole, and the Bureau believes that “account” is reasonably interpreted to include prepaid accounts.</footnote>
             While there were some concerns from industry and others, discussed in more detail below, about exactly which types of prepaid products the Bureau might subject to Regulation E, most commenters favored inclusion of GPR cards. Among other reasons, several industry trade associations noted that insofar as many GPR card issuers and program managers already voluntarily comply with Regulation E, the Bureau should formalize GPR cards' inclusion in Regulation E as a means of standardizing protections for consumers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A number of industry commenters, however, took issue with the Bureau's proposal to define prepaid account more broadly than just GPR cards. A number of these commenters, including program managers, a trade association, and a law firm writing on behalf of a coalition of prepaid issuers, stated that the scope of the proposal's coverage was a significant departure from the Bureau's Prepaid ANPR, which they noted focused exclusively on GPR cards and like products. A number of commenters, including trade associations and an issuing bank, urged the Bureau to focus its rulemaking on products that could be used in the same ways as traditional transaction accounts. The commenters contrasted such products, which they contended include GPR cards, with products that have limitations on use, such as non-reloadable cards or so-called reload packs, which are cards that can only be used to load funds onto GPR cards. According to the commenters, products that had limited uses or functions were generally characterized by a more limited relationship between the issuer and consumer, which made these types of products inherently riskier—from a fraud-prevention perspective—and less profitable to financial institutions than GPR cards. The commenters asserted that if these more limited product types were covered under the definition of prepaid account, the cost of adding Regulation E protections may cause issuers of those products to discontinue offering them. A number of trade associations advocated that the Bureau specifically exclude non-reloadable cards for these reasons. Similarly, these and other commenters urged the Bureau to exclude reload packs.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Other industry commenters objected to the Bureau's decision to cover “innovative” payment products, such as digital wallets capable of storing funds, mobile and electronic payments, mobile applications, and other products that were being or may one day be developed. A digital wallet provider argued for an explicit exemption for digital wallets, which it defined as card, code, or other device that is capable of accessing two or more payment credentials for purposes of making payment for goods and services at multiple unaffiliated merchants. According to the commenter, digital wallets and GPR cards should not be encompassed within the same regulatory regime because they have fundamentally different consumer use cases and functionalities, and as such are not viewed by consumers as interchangeable. For example, the commenter asserted, in contrast with GPR cards, digital wallets are used primarily to access payment credentials, not funds. The commenter further stated that, to the extent digital wallets store funds, such funds are almost always loaded onto the wallets as a result of a P2P transaction, not because the accountholder purposefully loads the wallet with funds for future use. In addition, the commenter argued, digital wallets do not present the same risks as prepaid accounts—specifically, digital wallets charge lower fees than GPR cards and do not offer overdraft features.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Other commenters, including an issuing bank, several industry trade associations, a think tank, and a group of members of Congress, argued that if the Bureau's prepaid accounts rule applied to such products, it would stifle growth and innovation by imposing a one-size-fits-all regime on a diverse and evolving market. These commenters advocated that the Bureau take an incremental approach to broadening the definition of prepaid account by including GPR cards in this final rule, and reevaluating the possible addition of other products at a later time.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A subset of these commenters, joined by a number of additional trade associations, a payment network, and an issuing bank, argued that the proposed definition was ambiguous and vague. Specifically, these commenters argued that the proposed definition did not draw a sufficiently clear line between accounts that were already covered by Regulation E—namely, demand deposit (checking) accounts, savings accounts, and other consumer asset accounts—and accounts that would newly be covered as prepaid accounts. These commenters expressed concern that under the proposed definition certain accounts could qualify as both prepaid accounts subject to the augmented Regulation E requirements of the proposal and traditional bank accounts (or other consumer asset accounts) subject to existing Regulation E requirements. Relatedly, other commenters stated that certain prepaid account issuers already considered their products covered under Regulation E as consumer asset accounts. As a result, commenters asserted, essentially identical products could be subject to different consumer protection regimes, resulting in inconsistent consumer protections for similar products and heightened compliance risk stemming from industry's uncertainty regarding which regime their products fall under. These commenters urged the Bureau to create a clearer demarcation between prepaid accounts and other types of accounts. Specifically, commenters proposed that the Bureau add greater clarity by limiting the definition of prepaid account. They had various suggestions for how to limit the definition, including, <em data-original="E-03">inter alia,</em> limiting it to GPR cards, accounts that can only be accessed by a physical card, accounts that are marketed and labeled as prepaid accounts, accounts held by a financial institution in an omnibus (or pooled) account structure, or accounts featuring some combination of these characteristics.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consumer groups likewise urged the Bureau to apply Regulation E to those prepaid products that consumers can use as transaction account substitutes because, in part, consumers do not know that their prepaid products lack certain protections offered by other transaction accounts. The consumer groups diverged from industry commenters, however, by largely supporting the breadth of the Bureau's proposed definition. A number of groups agreed with the Bureau's decision to include both reloadable and non-reloadable accounts in the proposed definition, arguing that the focus of the definition should be on how the account is used, not on how it is loaded. A think tank argued that consumer usage supported covering non-reloadable cards, noting that one-third of prepaid account users in its survey do not reuse their account after the initial amount of funds was depleted. A number of consumer groups advocated that the Bureau expand the proposed definition further to include specific types of non-reloadable cards loaded by third parties, such as student loan disbursement cards and prison release cards. Other consumer groups argued that a broad definition was necessary to accommodate new and changing products. These commenters supported the Bureau's decision to cover mobile and virtual payment systems, arguing that, as payment systems evolve, it was important not to adopt a narrow definition that would permit evasion.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Some commenters also urged the Bureau to expand the scope of the definition of government benefit account so that it applied to more categories of government benefit programs. Those comments and the Bureau's response thereto are discussed in greater detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.15(a) below.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is finalizing the rule to define the term “account” under Regulation E to include a “prepaid account,” while making several revisions to the proposed definition of prepaid account, as summarized below and discussed in greater detail in the section-by-section analyses that follow. EFTA section 903(2) defines an account broadly to be “a demand deposit, savings deposit, or other asset account . . . as described in regulations of the Bureau, established primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.” Insofar as the statute defines account broadly to include any other asset account and for the other reasons discussed below, the Bureau believes it is reasonable to interpret account in EFTA to include prepaid accounts. In general, the Bureau declines to narrow the scope of the proposed definition to cover, for example, only GPR cards, reloadable accounts, or cards that otherwise function as transaction account substitutes, as some commenters had requested.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As it stated in the proposal, the Bureau recognizes that not all types of prepaid products lend themselves to permanent use as transaction account substitutes. Nevertheless, the Bureau continues to believe that the features of non-GPR card prepaid products as well as the ways consumers can and do use those products warrant Regulation E protection and that the prepaid regime provided in this final rule is the most appropriate regime to apply. Consumers can receive significant disbursements of funds—such as tax refunds or pay-outs of home insurance proceeds—on non-reloadable prepaid cards. They can then use such cards for a variety of purposes, including making purchases and paying bills, for which error resolution and other Regulation E protections could be important.<footnote ref="295">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; 2013 FDIC Survey at 34 (finding that for all households that used prepaid debit cards in the last 12 months, 47.6 percent did so to pay for everyday purchases or to pay bills and 31.8 percent did so to receive payments).</footnote>
             Indeed, even though some types of prepaid cards may not be reloadable, consumers who lack other transaction accounts may depend entirely on such cards to meet their payment account needs, at least until the cards are spent down.<footnote ref="296">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g., id.&lt;/em&gt; (finding that for unbanked households that used prepaid debit cards in the last 12 months, 65 percent did so to pay for everyday purchases or to pay bills and 41.8 percent did so to receive payments).</footnote>
             Likewise, consumers increasingly use digital wallets to conduct daily financial transactions for which Regulation E protections are important. The Bureau is not convinced by the argument that digital wallets used in this fashion are fundamentally dissimilar to other types of prepaid accounts. Indeed, to the extent that they are used to access funds the consumer has deposited into the account in advance, the Bureau believes digital wallets operate very much like a prepaid account. The Bureau notes that the fact that digital wallets currently on the market may not charge usage fees, as one commenter asserted, may not hold true in the future, especially if these products become more widely used and the features and services offered broaden.<footnote ref="297">The same commenter argued in the alternative that, if digital wallets were not explicitly exempted from the definition of prepaid account, they be exempted from the pre-acquisition disclosure regime. That request, and the Bureau's response to it, are discussed in greater detail below.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is thus finalizing a definition of prepaid account that covers a range of products including GPR cards, as well as other products that may not be used as transaction account substitutes, such as certain non-reloadable accounts and digital wallets. The Bureau recognizes that the scope of the final rule's coverage extends beyond the types of accounts that were the primary focus of in the Prepaid ANPR, as some commenters remarked. The Bureau notes, however, that the ANPR also asked broader questions regarding the potential definitional scope for a prepaid rulemaking. While an ANPR is not a required part of the rulemaking process under the Administrative Procedures Act, the over 220 comments received in response helped inform the scope the Bureau's proposal. The Bureau notes in addition, and in response to comments from consumer groups, that the final rule's definition is broad enough to cover prepaid accounts used by consumers in various scenarios and for various purposes, so long as those accounts meet the specific provisions of the definition, as set forth below. This would include, for example, student loan disbursement cards and prison release cards that meet the other criteria set forth in the definition.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>At the same time, the Bureau appreciates commenters' concerns that the single broad proposed umbrella definition could have created too much uncertainty as to treatment of products that were already subject to Regulation E prior to this rulemaking, and their concern that certain additional narrow categories of products should be excluded from the definition due to various unique circumstances. The Bureau has considered various avenues for addressing these concerns, including, as suggested by commenters, limiting coverage under the final rule to only GPR cards or to accounts held by a financial institution in an omnibus (or pooled) structure. As set forth in greater detail below, the Bureau has decided to add further clarity to the proposed definition by adding a reference to the way the account is marketed or labeled, as well as to the account's primary function. The Bureau is not finalizing a definition that would limit coverage to only GPR cards, as stated above, because it continues to believe that the features of non-GPR card prepaid products as well as the ways consumers can and do use those products warrant Regulation E protection. In addition, the Bureau declines to limit coverage under the definition to accounts held in a pooled account structure, because the Bureau believes that the characteristics that make an account a prepaid account should not be dependent on the product's back-office infrastructure.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition to minor changes to streamline the definition and sequence of the regulation, the Bureau has reorganized the structure of the definition and added certain wording to the final rule that is designed to more cleanly differentiate products that are subject to this final rule from those that are subject to general Regulation E. First, to streamline the definition and to eliminate redundancies, the Bureau is omitting the phrase “card, code, or other device, not otherwise an account under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, which is established primarily for personal, family, or household purposes” from final § 1005.2(b)(3)(i). Second, the Bureau is clarifying the scope of the definition by adding a reference to the way the account is marketed or labeled, as well as to the account's primary function. Under the final definition, therefore, an account is a prepaid account if it is a payroll card account or government benefit account; <em data-original="E-03">or</em> it is marketed or labeled as “prepaid,” provided it is redeemable upon presentation at multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services or usable at ATMs; <em data-original="E-03">or</em> it meets <em data-original="E-03">all</em> of the following criteria: (a) It is issued on a prepaid basis in a specified amount or not issued on a prepaid basis but capable of being loaded with funds thereafter; (b) its primary function is to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, or at ATMs, or to conduct P2P transfers; and (c) it is not a checking account, share draft account, or NOW account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The final rule also contains several additional exclusions from the definition of prepaid account for: (1) Accounts loaded only with funds from a dependent care assistance program or a transit or parking reimbursement arrangement; (2) accounts that are directly or indirectly established through a third party and loaded only with qualified disaster relief payments; and (3) the P2P functionality of accounts established by or through the U.S. government whose primary function is to conduct closed-loop transactions on U.S. military installations or vessels, or similar government facilities. Other than these clarifications and exclusions discussed herein, the Bureau does not intend the changed language in the final rule to significantly alter the scope of the proposed definition of the term prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>33(a)(2) Types of Inquiries and Transfers Not Covered</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(a)(2) listed circumstances that would not constitute errors. In particular, proposed § 205.33(a)(2)(i) provided that an inquiry about a transfer of $15 or less does not constitute an error, since these small-value transfers do not fall within the scope of the definition of “remittance transfer.” <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.30(e)(2), discussed above. Under proposed § 205.33(a)(2)(ii), an inquiry about the status of a remittance transfer—for example, if the sender calls to ask whether the funds have been made available in the foreign country—would also not be an error (unless the funds have not been made available by the disclosed date of availability). Finally, similar to § 1005.11(a)(2)(ii) for EFTs, a sender's request for information for tax or other recordkeeping purposes would not constitute an error under proposed § 205.33(a)(2)(iii).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that because transfers of $15 or less are not “remittance transfers” under § 1005.30(e)(2), such transfers are not covered under the remittance transfer provisions in subpart B. Therefore, the Bureau believes it is not necessary to state that an inquiry involving a transfer of $15 or less is not an error, and is not adopting proposed § 205.33(a)(2)(i). A Federal Reserve Bank commenter noted that for certain assertions of error that exceed the $15 threshold, providers may still not have the ability to investigate the assertion because they are less than the minimum amount traceable in a foreign country. In order to ensure that senders are protected with respect to errors related to remittance transfers other than truly <em data-original="E-03">de minimis</em> amounts, however, the Bureau is not inclined to create another threshold amount above the $15 coverage threshold for which an inquiry is not an error. The Bureau did not receive comments on proposed § 205.33(a)(2)(ii) or (iii). These provisions are adopted as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(a)(2)(i) and (ii), respectively.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In the final rule, the Bureau is adopting provisions describing two other circumstances that do not constitute errors in response to comments received. Section 1005.33(a)(2)(iii) provides that a change requested by the designated recipient is not an error. Comment 33(a)-7 clarifies new § 1005.33(a)(2)(iii) by providing that the exception is available only if the change is made solely because the designated recipient requested the change. The comment also includes an illustrative example. The example explains that if a sender requests a remittance transfer provider to send US$100 to a designated recipient at a designated location, but the designated recipient requests the amount in a different currency (either at the sender-designated location or another location requested by the recipient) and the remittance transfer provider accommodates the recipient's request, the change does not constitute an error.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau understands that as a service to the recipient, a remittance transfer provider may offer to provide the remittance transfer in a different currency or permit the transfer to be picked up at a location different than originally requested by the sender. In such cases, the Bureau believes that this type of customer service should be preserved. The Bureau, however, is concerned that remittance transfer providers may try to provide the remittance transfer to the designated recipient in a different currency simply because the provider or its agent do not have sufficient amounts of the sender-requested currency on hand. Therefore, the Bureau believes that this exception should only be available if the change is made solely because the designated recipient requested the change.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.33(a)(2)(iv) is also new and provides that an error does not include a change in the amount or type of currency received by the designated recipient from the amount or type of currency stated in the disclosure provided to the sender under § 1005.31(b)(2) or (3) if the remittance transfer provider relied on information provided by the sender as permitted by the commentary accompanying § 1005.31 in making such disclosure. As discussed above, a remittance transfer provider may rely on the sender's representations in making certain disclosures. For example, a remittance transfer provider can rely on the representations of the sender regarding the currency that can be provided in the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 33(a)-8 elaborates on the exclusion by providing two illustrative examples. Under one example, a sender requests U.S. dollars to be deposited into an account of the designated recipient and represents that the account is U.S. dollar-denominated. If the designated recipient's account is actually denominated in local currency and the recipient account-holding institution must convert the remittance transfer into local currency in order to deposit the funds and complete the transfer, the change in currency does not constitute an error pursuant to § 1005.33(a)(2)(iv). Similarly, if the remittance transfer provider relies on the sender's representations regarding variables that affect the amount of taxes imposed by a person other than the provider for purposes of determining these taxes, the change in the amount of currency the designated recipient actually receives due to the taxes actually imposed does not constitute an error pursuant to § 1005.33(a)(2)(iv).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>33(a)(2) Types of Inquiries and Transfers Not Covered</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.33(a)(2) and the accompanying commentary address circumstances that do not constitute errors under the 2012 Final Rule.  Section 1005.33(a)(2)(iv) provides that an error does not include a change in the amount or type of currency stated in the disclosure provided to the sender under § 1005.31(b)(2) or (3), if the remittance transfer provider relied on information provided by the sender as permitted by the commentary accompanying § 1005.31 in making such disclosure.  Comment 33(a)-8 of the 2012 Final Rule provides two illustrative examples. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The December Proposal would have made revisions to § 1005.33(a)(2)(iv) in accordance with the proposed revisions to §§ 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) and (vii) and the accompanying commentary to make clear that an error does not include a change in the amount of currency received by the designated recipient from the amount disclosed because the remittance transfer provider did not disclose foreign taxes other than those imposed by a central government.  This proposed change would have been consistent with the proposed elimination of the requirement to disclose subnational taxes pursuant to proposed § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi).  Insofar as the Bureau is not adopting this part of the proposal these proposed changes to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) are not being adopted in the 2013 Final Rule. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also proposed revisions to renumber and revise comment 33(a)-8 in the 2012 Final Rule in light of the revisions proposed to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) and (vii) to explain that a remittance transfer provider need not disclose regional, provincial, state or other local foreign taxes.  Proposed comment 33(a)-9 would have revised the comment to explain that a provider need not disclose regional, provincial, state or other local foreign taxes.  The proposed revisions also would have made clear that where, under the proposal, a provider was permitted to rely on a sender's representations, no error would have occurred.  As proposed, comment 33(a)-9 would additionally have explained that any discrepancy between the amount disclosed and the actual amount received resulting from the provider's reliance upon the proposed provision that would not have required the disclosure of subnational taxes would not constitute an error under § 1005.33(a)(2)(iv).  Insofar as the Bureau is not adopting the proposed changes regarding subnational taxes, the proposed revisions to the comment are no longer relevant and are not being adopted.  The Bureau is, however, removing language from comment 33(a)-8 that referred to a provider's reliance on the sender's representations regarding variables that affect the amount of taxes imposed by a person other than the provider because such taxes are no longer required to be disclosed.  The comment is finalized as comment 33(a)-10.  In the 2013 Final Rule comment 33(a)-10 states that under the commentary accompanying § 1005.31, the remittance transfer provider may rely on the sender's representations in making certain disclosures. <em data-original="E-03">See, e.g.,</em> comments 31(b)(1)(iv)-1 and 31(b)(1)(vi)-1.  For example, suppose a sender requests U.S. dollars to be deposited into an account of the designated recipient and represents that the account is U.S. dollar-denominated.  If the designated recipient's account is actually denominated in local currency and the recipient account-holding institution must convert the remittance transfer into local currency in order to deposit the funds and complete the transfer, the change in currency does not constitute an error pursuant to § 1005.33(a)(2)(iv). </analysisParagraph>

        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii) requires financial institutions to provide an electronic history of the consumer's payroll card account transactions, such as through a Web site, that covers at least 60 days preceding the date the consumer electronically accesses the account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to extend this existing requirement in § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii) to prepaid accounts in proposed § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) and to expand the length of time that online access must cover from 60 days to 18 months. The Bureau proposed to extend this time period because it believed that based on how consumers are currently using prepaid accounts, more than 60 days of account history may be, in many cases, beneficial for consumers. While recent account history is important for consumers tracking balances or monitoring for unauthorized transactions, a longer available account history serves a variety of potential purposes. For example, some consumers might need to demonstrate on-time bill payment or to compile year-end data for tax preparation purposes. The Bureau also believed that a consumer may realize during any given year that he or she needs financial records from the prior calendar year and that access to 18 months of prepaid account history would give the consumer six months into the next calendar year. In addition, based on pre-proposal outreach to prepaid account providers and publicly available studies, the Bureau believed that many prepaid accounts provide at least 12 months of account history and that, even if they do not, the cost of extending existing online histories to 18 months would be minimal.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1005.18(b)(1)(iii) requires financial institutions to provide a written history of the consumer's payroll card account transactions promptly in response to an oral or written request, that covers at least 60 days preceding the date the financial institution receives the consumer's request. Similar to the requirement to provide electronic account transaction history, the Bureau proposed to extend this requirement to all prepaid accounts in proposed § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii) and to expand the length of time for which written history must be provided from 60 days to 18 months. The Bureau also proposed to extend to all prepaid accounts existing comment 18(b)-1, which requires that the account transactions histories provided under existing § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii) and (iii) reflect transactions once they have been posted to the account, renumbered as proposed comment 18(c)-1. In addition, the Bureau also proposed to extend to all prepaid accounts existing comment 18(b)-2 regarding retainability of electronic account history renumbered as proposed comment 18(c)-2.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau recognized that in certain situations, consumers' requests for written account information may exceed what would be required under the proposal; therefore, the Bureau proposed to clarify in proposed comment 18(c)-3 those instances where a financial institution would be permitted to charge a fee for providing such information. Proposed comment 18(c)-3 would have included several examples of requests that exceed the requirements of proposed § 1005.18(c)(1) for providing account information and for which a financial institution would be permitted to charge a fee.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 18(c)-4 would have explained that a financial institution may provide fewer than 18 months of written account transaction history if the consumer requests a shorter period of time. If a prepaid account has been open for fewer than 18 months, the financial institution need only provide account information pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) and (iii) since the time of account opening. If a prepaid account is closed or becomes inactive, as defined by the financial institution, the financial institution must continue to provide at least 18 months of account transaction information from the date the request is received. In addition, this comment would have explained that when a prepaid account has been closed or inactive for 18 months, the financial institution is no longer required to make any account or transaction information available. The proposed comment would have referenced existing comment 9(b)-3, which provides that, with respect to written periodic statements, a financial institution need not send statements to consumers whose accounts are inactive as defined by the institution.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received many comments requesting that it modify the time period that must be covered in a consumer's electronic and written account transaction history. Most consumer groups supported the Bureau's proposal to provide at least 18 months of account transaction history, noting the consumer benefits of having a longer time period and arguing that the impact on industry should be minimal because data storage costs continue to decrease and consumers rarely request copies of their account transaction history. These commenters also argued that—contrary to the Bureau's proposal—financial institutions should not be permitted to charge a fee for providing written account transaction history that is older than the required time period, arguing that it should not cost more to print and mail older information than it is to print and mail newer information.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A few consumer groups argued, however, that a 24-month time period would be more appropriate than 18 months because consumers could identify seasonal patterns, and October 15 tax filers could access transactions earlier than March 15 of the previous year. One of these commenters explained that it could take months for unauthorized transactions to be recognized and months or years to complete fraud investigations and resolve disputes with third parties. This commenter also stated that 24 months would allow consumers to access a longer period of account history, which would be particularly helpful to consumers who are unable to print or save transaction history on a regular basis. These commenters also requested that written account transaction histories go back at least seven years, which they said would be consistent with some document retention policies, so that consumers who use prepaid accounts as primary transaction accounts could look up older charges in the event of a tax audit or when applying for a mortgage.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A number of industry commenters, including issuing banks and credit unions, trade associations, and program managers, urged the Bureau to shorten the proposed 18-month time period and, relatedly, stated that financial institutions would need longer than the proposed nine-month compliance period to implement the requirement as proposed. These commenters argued that the potential costs to industry would outweigh any consumer benefit, since, in their experience, consumers rarely request 18 months of transaction history and do not currently use account transaction history for tax preparation purposes. Some industry commenters requested a 60-day time period, which they stated would be consistent with the current periodic statement alternative for payroll card accounts and with the error resolution and limited liability notification requirements under Regulation E. Other industry commenters requested a time period of no longer than 12 months, arguing that most financial institutions do not retain more than 12 months of account transaction history in a real-time online format, and therefore, requiring a longer time period would be problematic for financial institutions. These commenters also stated that 12 months would be sufficient for consumers to manage their accounts and would be consistent with consumer expectation. Several other industry commenters requested that the Bureau instead require financial institutions to provide consumers with a copy of their written account transaction history upon request once every 12 months at no cost and then allow financial institutions to charge a reasonable fee for any subsequent requests made during that 12-month time period. One of the credit union commenters argued that the time period to provide account transaction history should be left to the financial institution's discretion.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several of these industry commenters argued that maintaining 18 months of account transaction history would result in significant costs to financial institutions. These commenters explained that storing and securing such information would lead to operational costs related to upgrading systems, changing record retention policies and procedures, and training personnel.<footnote ref="476">These industry commenters also described specific actions that they believed would increase costs and burden. These included updating data processor systems (or developing interfaces with third-party providers' processing systems); purchasing data storage systems; and redesigning platforms and Web sites.</footnote>
             Several credit union trade associations argued that the proposed time period would be especially problematic for credit unions because they retain limited historical account information in their systems and rely on periodic statements if a member requests information beyond what is in their systems.<footnote ref="477">Under the Bureau's proposal, however, if a financial institution provides a periodic statement, it would not have been required to make available 18 months of electronic account transaction history. The Bureau thus believes these commenters' concerns regarding issues related to retaining a longer period of account history are misplaced.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters explained some of the differences between the types of information needed to make available and provide electronic and written account transaction histories and the costs associated with maintaining each. These commenters stated that generally, information in a real-time, online database is necessary to make available electronic account transaction history, and archived information is retrieved to provide written account transaction history that extends beyond the time period retained in the real-time database. These commenters stated that real-time information is usually archived after 12 months of the account being opened or when the account is closed, if sooner, and typically retained for several years. They explained that real-time information is easier to access, but more expensive to maintain than archived information, and archived information is inexpensive to maintain, but can be difficult to access. These commenters therefore concluded that maintaining 18 months of electronic account transaction information would be costly because maintaining that length of real-time information is expensive. These commenters further argued that responding to one-off requests from consumers for 18 months of written account transaction history would also be problematic because archived information, although inexpensive to maintain, is usually restricted to certain personnel or stored with a third-party processor, who typically charges a fee to retrieve the information. These commenters also argued that mailing account transaction histories that cover a time period longer than 60 days would increase printing and mailing costs.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Despite the costs associated with retrieving archived information, these commenters stated that they would rather provide a longer period of written account transaction history than make available a longer period of electronic account transaction history, given that maintaining electronic history is more expensive. However, because of the cost and complexity associated with retrieving archived information, these commenters requested that the Bureau allow financial institutions to begin accumulating data as of the effective date of the final rule (until they have built up to 18 months of accumulated transaction history), rather than requiring financial institutions to make available or provide the full length of account transaction histories as of the effective date, to alleviate some of the compliance burden.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A few program managers suggested further modifications that they believed would help reduce the costs associated with the proposed periodic statement alternative. Two of these program managers urged the Bureau to allow financial institutions to charge a fee for responding to requests for written account transaction histories. Another requested that the Bureau expressly allow financial institutions to inform consumers that they may request written history that covers less than the required time period.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is finalizing § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) and (iii) with modifications to revise the time periods a consumer's electronic and written account transaction history must cover. Specifically, final § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) requires financial institutions to make available electronic account transaction history that covers at least 12 months preceding the date the consumer electronically accesses the account, instead of 18 months as proposed. Final § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii) requires financial institutions to provide written account transaction history that covers at least 24 months preceding the date the financial institution receives the consumer's request, instead of 18 months as proposed. The Bureau continues to believe that, based on how consumers are currently using prepaid accounts, access to more than 60 days of electronic and written account transaction history will be beneficial to consumers for a variety of reasons, such as monitoring for unauthorized transactions, tracking spending habits, demonstrating on-time bill payment, and compiling year-end data for tax preparation purposes.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>However, based on the response from industry commenters, the Bureau is persuaded that providing 18 months of electronic account transaction history could be particularly burdensome to industry, especially since costs related to retaining electronic history increase as the time period lengthens. The Bureau believes that 12 months of electronic account transaction history is consistent with the length of history consumers expect to access online and should not be problematic for financial institutions since many already provide at least 12 months of account transaction history, as discussed by industry commenters. The Bureau thus believes this revision strikes the appropriate balance between burden imposed on industry overall while, in conjunction with final § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii), ensuring that additional transaction history will be available for consumers who need it. The Bureau reminds financial institutions that neither they nor their service providers are permitted to charge consumers a fee for accessing electronic account transaction history when providing that information as part of the periodic statement alternative pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Considering the costs associated with maintaining electronic account transaction history, as discussed by commenters, the Bureau declines at this time to require financial institutions to provide electronic account transaction history covering a time period longer than 12 months. However, under the final rule, consumers will be able to request 24 months of written account transaction history pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii), which the Bureau believes adequately addresses the various scenarios offered by consumer group commenters as to why consumers may need access to a longer period of account transaction history. In addition, the Bureau does not believe that the time period for electronic account transaction histories should be left to the financial institution's discretion, as requested by one commenter, because consistency across the market reduces any potential for consumer confusion and assures that sufficient history is available for all consumers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With regard to written account transaction histories, under the final rule, consumers will benefit from having access to two full years of transaction information if needed, without requiring industry to absorb the expense of making that length of information available electronically on an ongoing basis. The Bureau declines to require financial institutions to provide seven years of written account transaction history, as suggested by several commenters. The Bureau believes that 24 months of written history upon request is sufficient to meet the needs of consumers and does not believe it is necessary at this time to require financial institutions to provide an even longer written account history upon request at no cost. Based on information received from industry commenters, the Bureau believes the requirement to provide 24 months of written account transaction history, in conjunction with the requirement to provide 12 months of electronic account transaction history under final § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii), strikes an appropriate balance in providing consumers with the information necessary to manage their accounts while not imposing undue burden on industry. As explained by these commenters, maintaining archived information, which a financial institution will likely need to retrieve to provide 24 months of written history, is less expensive than retaining the real-time information necessary for making electronic history available online. Moreover, because, as explained by some commenters, many financial institutions already retain several years of archived data and consumers do not typically request long periods of written history, the Bureau does not believe that maintaining, retrieving, and providing 24 months of written history upon request should be particularly burdensome to financial institutions. The Bureau notes that financial institutions are not required to provide written history for a longer period than what the consumer actually wants; a financial institution may, for example, inform consumers that they may request written history that covers less than 24 months.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, as explained in the proposal, the Bureau anticipates that, in general, written transaction account histories will be sent the next business day or soon after a financial institution receives the consumer's oral or written request. Financial institutions may also designate a specific telephone number for consumers to call and a specific address for consumers to write to request a written copy of their account transaction history.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Regarding industry commenters' concerns about the proposed nine-month compliance period, final § 1005.18(h)(1) imposes a general effective date of October 1, 2017 for this final rule. However, final § 1005.18(h)(3)(i) provides an accommodation for financial institutions that do not have readily accessible the data necessary to make available 12 months of electronic account transaction history pursuant to final § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) or 24 months of written account transaction history upon request pursuant to final § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii) on October 1, 2017. Specifically, in that case, the financial institution may make available or provide the electronic and written histories using the data for the time period it has until the financial institution has accumulated the data necessary to comply in full with the requirements of final § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) and (iii). See the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(h) below for additional information about the final rule's effective dates and related accommodations.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received no comments specifically addressing proposed comment 18(c)-1. Accordingly, the Bureau is finalizing comment 18(c)-1 as proposed. This comment explains that the electronic and written history of the consumer's account transactions provided under final § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) and (iii), respectively, shall reflect transfers once they have been posted to the account. Thus, a financial institution does not need to include transactions that have been authorized but that have not yet posted to the account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received no comments regarding proposed comment 18(c)-2. Accordingly, the Bureau is finalizing comment 18(c)-2 as proposed. This comment explains that the electronic history required under final § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) must be made available in a form that the consumer may keep, as required under § 1005.4(a)(1). Financial institutions may satisfy this requirement if they make the electronic history available in a format that is capable of being retained. For example, a financial institution satisfies the requirement if it provides electronic history on a Web site in a format that is capable of being printed or stored electronically using a web browser.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is finalizing comment 18(c)-3 substantially as proposed, with minor modifications for consistency with the revised time periods in the regulatory text. Specifically, final comment 18(c)-3 clarifies that financial institutions may charge a fee for providing written account transaction history that is older than 24 months. This comment also provides examples of requests that exceed the requirements of final § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii) and which therefore a financial institution may charge a fee. In addition, the Bureau has revised the internal paragraph references to conform to other numbering changes in this final rule.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau declines at this time to permit financial institutions to charge consumers a fee for providing the written account transaction history required by final § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii), as suggested by some commenters. As with the electronic account transaction history required by § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii), the Bureau believes it is necessary for consumers to have free access to at least 24 months of written account transaction history to effectively manage their prepaid accounts. The Bureau believes that charging fees to consumers who make occasional requests for written histories could have a chilling effect on consumers' ability to obtain information about transactions and, thus, to exercise their error resolution rights. The Bureau reminds financial institutions that neither they nor their service providers are permitted to charge consumers a fee for requesting written account transaction history when providing that information as part of the periodic statement alternative pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For the final rule, the Bureau has divided proposed comment 18(c)-4 into two, numbered as final comments 18(c)-4 and -5, to discuss the requirements for electronic and written account transaction history separately. The Bureau is finalizing the portion of comment 18(c)-4 addressing electronic account transaction history, with several modifications. Specifically, final comment 18(c)-4 no longer explains that if a prepaid account is closed or becomes inactive, as defined by the financial institution, the financial institution must continue to provide at least 18 months of account transaction information from the date the request is received. In addition, final comment 18(c)-4 no longer states that when a prepaid account has been closed or inactive for 18 months, the financial institution is no longer required to make available any account or transaction information. Given the revised time periods that electronic and written account transaction histories must cover, the Bureau has also removed from final comment 18(c)-4 the references to written account transaction history and, as discussed below, is adopting new comment 18(c)-5 to explain separately the requirements for providing access to written account transaction history. In addition, the Bureau has revised the internal paragraph references in comment 18(c)-4 to conform to other numbering changes in this final rule and has made several other modifications for clarity.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Specifically, final comment 18(c)-4 clarifies that, if a prepaid account has been opened for fewer than 12 months, the financial institution need only provide electronic account transaction history pursuant to final § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) since the time of account opening. Final comment 18(c)-4 also explains that, if a prepaid account is closed or becomes inactive, as defined by the financial institution, the financial institution need not make available electronic account transaction history. This comment cross-references comment 9(b)-3.<footnote ref="478">Existing comment 9(b)-3 provides that a financial institution is not required to send periodic statements to consumers whose accounts are inactive as defined by the financial institution.</footnote>
             However, if an inactive account becomes active, the financial institution must again make available 12 months of electronic account transaction history. The Bureau does not believe it is necessary to require financial institutions to continue making access to electronic history available for closed and inactive accounts because consumers do not typically expect to access this information electronically once an account is closed or becomes inactive. The Bureau also believes that not requiring financial institutions to provide electronic access for closed and inactive accounts will reduce burden on industry relative to the proposal, and consumers will still have access to such information, if needed, in writing upon request as required by final § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As noted above, the Bureau is adopting new comment 18(c)-5 to explain the requirements for providing access to written account transaction history that had been addressed in proposed comment 18(c)-4. The Bureau is adopting the requirements substantially as proposed, with several minor modifications. Specifically, new comment 18(c)-5 explains that a financial institution may provide fewer than 24 months of written account transaction history if the consumer requests a shorter period of time. This comment also clarifies that, if a prepaid account has been opened for fewer than 24 months, the financial institution need only provide written account transaction history pursuant to final § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii) since the time of account opening. Even if a prepaid account is closed or becomes inactive, the financial institution must continue to provide upon request at least 24 months of written account transaction history preceding the date the request is received. When a prepaid account has been closed or inactive for 24 months or longer, the financial institution is no longer required to make available any written account transaction history pursuant to final § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii). In addition, the Bureau has revised the internal paragraph references in comment 18(c)-5 to conform to other numbering changes in this final rule and has made several other modifications for clarity.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, § 1005.7(b) currently requires financial institutions to provide certain initial disclosures when a consumer contracts for an EFT service or before the first EFT is made involving a consumer's account. The Bureau proposed in revised § 1005.18(b)(1)(i) that, in addition to the initial disclosures that are usually provided in an account's terms and conditions document pursuant to existing § 1005.7(b), a financial institution would also have to provide a consumer with certain fee-related disclosures before a consumer acquired a prepaid account. In the proposal, the Bureau explained its concerns as noted above that while some financial institutions were already providing limited disclosures to consumers prior to acquisition, consumers across a range of acquisition channels did not always have access to consistent and comprehensive information before selecting a prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Based on its outreach and research, the Bureau explained in the proposal its understanding that some financial institutions were not disclosing the fees that consumers may find relevant to their acquisition decision until the account was purchased (or otherwise acquired), the packaging material was opened, and the consumer reviewed the enclosed account agreement document. To take just one example, one prepaid product the Bureau looked at imposed an inactivity fee after 90 days of no transactions, but this fee was not disclosed on an outward-facing external surface of the prepaid account access device's packaging material that was visible before purchase. Further, the Bureau expressed concern that new employees might have been receiving terms and conditions documents regarding payroll card accounts at the same time they received substantial other benefits-related paperwork, making the fees difficult for employees to comprehend while sorting through other important and time-sensitive documents. Similarly, certain providers of prepaid accounts online may have been presenting disclosures on their Web sites in a way that made it difficult for consumers to have the chance to review them prior to acquisition.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In the proposal, the Bureau stated its belief that, for several reasons, consumers in all acquisition scenarios would benefit from receiving these new pre-acquisition disclosures prior to contracting for an EFT service or before the first EFT was made involving the account, at which point they would receive the initial disclosures that § 1005.7(b) already requires.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>First, the Bureau believed that pre-acquisition disclosures could limit the ability of financial institutions to obscure key fees. For example, many participants in the Bureau's consumer pre-proposal consumer testing reported incurring fees that they did not become aware of until after they purchased their prepaid account.<footnote ref="379">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report I at 7.</footnote>
             Several participants also admitted to having difficulty understanding the disclosures they received with their current prepaid accounts and were very unsure as to whether key fees had been disclosed before they acquired the accounts.<footnote ref="380">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See id.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
             The Bureau believes that its pre-acquisition disclosure regime will reduce the likelihood that these problems recur.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Second, the Bureau believed that, in order to comparison shop among products, it is helpful for consumers to be able to review disclosures setting forth key terms in like ways before choosing a product. The Bureau recognized that consumers offered prepaid products by third parties like employers or educational institutions may be unable to easily comparison shop. For example, at the time students are offered a student card from their university, such as when registering for school, they might be unable to compare that card with other products. The Bureau believed, however, that even in this scenario, students benefit from receiving the short form and the long form disclosure so that they can better understand the product's terms before deciding to accept it. Additionally, the Bureau believed that both the short and long form disclosures could inform the way in which these consumers decide to use the product once they acquired it.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Third, the Bureau believed that consumers could use their prepaid account for an extended period of time and potentially incur substantial fees over that time. For example, the Bureau noted that, during its pre-proposal consumer testing, participants indicated that they tend to use a given prepaid account, even one they do not like, at least until they spend the entirety of the initial load amount, which could be as much as $500, paying whatever fees are incurred in the course of doing so. Other research is consistent. Specifically, the Bureau cited to one study that indicated that prepaid accounts receiving direct deposit of government benefits might have life spans of as long as three years, and consumers who receive non-government direct deposit on their accounts use them on average for longer than one year.<footnote ref="381">2012 FRB Kansas City Study at 40.</footnote>
             Thus, the Bureau believed that whatever disclosure information a consumer used when selecting a prepaid account could have a significant and potentially long-term impact, especially if a consumer chooses to receive direct deposit into a prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Regulation E, however, currently only provides for initial disclosures to be delivered at the time a consumer contracts for an EFT service or before the first EFT is made involving a consumer's account. The Bureau was concerned that, in the prepaid account context, this might sometimes be too late. With prepaid accounts, consumers often contract for an EFT service when acquiring the prepaid account and completing an initial load. The Bureau was concerned that, under the timing requirements for initial disclosures in § 1005.7, consumers were receiving fee-related disclosures too late to use them in their decision-making and comparison-shopping. The Bureau therefore proposed § 1005.18(b)(1)(i), which would have required a financial institution, in most cases, to provide the short form and long form disclosures before a consumer acquired a prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also proposed to add comment 18(b)(1)(i)-1, which would have provided examples of what would and would not qualify as providing disclosures pre-acquisition in the bank branch and payroll contexts. Proposed comment 18(b)(1)(i)-2 would have provided further explanation regarding circumstances when short form and long form disclosures would have been considered to have been delivered after a consumer acquires a prepaid account, and thus in violation of the timing requirement in proposed § 1005.18(b)(1)(i).</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As with the timing of acquisition of a government benefit account, discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.15(c) above, the Bureau received numerous comments requesting that it provide further clarification on the meaning of the term acquisition in the payroll card context.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A number of commenters urged that, as with government benefit accounts, acquisition in the payroll card account context should be defined as the point at which the consumer chooses to receive wages via a payroll card account. These commenters included issuers, program managers, employers that use payroll card accounts, a think tank, and trade associations representing the prepaid industry and payroll and human resource professionals. The commenters argued in support of defining acquisition as the point of consumer choice because it has already been adopted in several states' wage and hour laws, emphasizing that those laws have the same purpose as this rule: to ensure that employees are aware that they have options with regard to how they get paid. The commenters argued that alternative approaches—for example, defining acquisition as the point at which an employee takes physical possession of a payroll card—could cause significant disruption to current industry practice. Under current practice, they asserted, an employee may arrive on the first day of work and receive a package containing an inactive payroll card account, disclosures related to that account, and additional information regarding payroll, benefits, and other work-related issues. According to commenters, this practice is beneficial to employees, as an employee is more likely to be engaged in the on-boarding process and to ask questions about the payroll card on that first day than at some later time, so distributing the card and disclosures together in that circumstance maximizes the chances that the employee will review the disclosures and ask related questions. Further, these commenters asserted, an employee who possesses a physical payroll card has at least one way of receiving his pay. If he chooses the payroll card, they argued, he will be paid quickly and without much hassle, in contrast to paper checks, which can take time to clear and cost money to cash or deposit, or direct deposit, which requires the employee to submit additional information to the employer in order to set up.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One employer that uses payroll card accounts to distribute wages to its employees argued that acquisition should mean either the point at which a consumer affirmatively chooses to receive wages via a payroll card account, or the point at which a consumer fails to make a choice from among a previously-presented list of available payment options. According to this commenter, some employers provide payroll cards as the default payment option if an employee fails to affirmatively elect a payment option. This practice, the commenter maintained, should be allowed to continue so long as the employee is notified (and where permitted by State law).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>On the other hand, a number of consumer groups stated that under current payroll card disbursement processes, there have been continuing reports of employers steering employees to select payroll card accounts as their payment method. Such reports, they maintained, show that current methods for distributing payroll cards or disclosures do not sufficiently ensure that employees have the time and information they need to evaluate or choose an alternative payment method. Relatedly, two consumer groups also argued that employees should be given a minimum number of days (seven, according to one commenter, and 30, according to the other) before they are required to select a method of payment. Other commenters did not suggest a specific point in time for defining acquisition. Rather, they urged the Bureau to define acquisition in a way that ensures employees receive the pre-acquisition disclosures earlier than they currently receive the initial account opening disclosures pursuant to § 1005.7.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to online acquisition, a digital wallet provider argued that the point of acquisition for a digital wallet should be the point at which the consumer's account first holds a balance, not the point at which the consumer sets up or opens the account. Prior to the point at which the account holds a balance, the commenter argued, the pre-acquisition disclosures are irrelevant and may confuse consumers and cause them to abandon the online sign-up process. In addition, the commenter urged the Bureau to revise proposed comment 18(b)(1)(i)-2 to allow digital wallet providers to collect personally identifiable information before providing the disclosures. The commenter noted that these providers have to collect certain information in order to open the account. In a similar vein, a program manager asked the Bureau to clarify that the collection of certain personally identifiable information from a consumer does not by itself constitute “acquisition.” The commenter provided the example of an individual who goes online and submits her name and address in order to receive more information about a prepaid product by mail. The commenter was concerned that proposed comment 18(b)(1)(i)-2 could be read to require the financial institution to provide the short and long form disclosures before the consumer submitted this information, even if the consumer was providing the information on a third-party Web site while seeking information about multiple prepaid account products.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Also with respect to online acquisition of accounts, a consumer group commenter asked the Bureau to clarify that consumers must be shown both the short form and long form prior to acquiring the account, not just provided a link to them. The commenter argued that there was a lack of clarity in proposed comment 18(b)(1)(i)-2 around this point, since the comment both states that the consumer should not be able to easily bypass the disclosures, and that the financial institution can include a link to the long form on the same Web page as it discloses the short form.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting § 1005.18(b)(1)(i) largely as proposed, with a technical revision. The Bureau is also adopting proposed comments 18(b)(1)(i)-1 and -2 with several revisions. First, the Bureau has added guidance in comment 18(b)(1)(i)-1 to clarify that for purposes of § 1005.18(b)(1)(i), a consumer acquires a prepaid account by purchasing, opening, or choosing to be paid via a prepaid card. Second, the Bureau has added clarification to comment 18(b)(1)(i)-1.ii to explain that, in the context of payroll card accounts, short form and long form disclosures are provided pre-acquisition if they were provided before a consumer chose to receive wages via a payroll card. Third, the Bureau has revised comment 18(b)(1)(i)-2 to clarify that a consumer who goes online to obtain more information about a prepaid account does not acquire a prepaid account by providing personally identifiable information in the process. The comment also provides additional examples of when a consumer who acquires a prepaid account electronically receives the short form and long comments for clarity and consistency.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting § 1005.18(b)(1)(i), as well as § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii) and (iii) discussed below, pursuant to its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c), and 905(a), and section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act. As discussed above, the Bureau believes that adjustment of the timing and fee requirements and the disclosure language is necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account users because the revision will assist consumers' understanding of the terms and conditions of their prepaid accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Specifically, the Bureau has added language to comment 18(b)(1)(i)-1 stating that a consumer acquires a prepaid account by purchasing, opening, or choosing to be paid via a prepaid account. The Bureau agrees with commenters that additional clarity was needed around the use of the term acquisition in circumstances where the consumer does not <em data-original="E-03">purchase</em> the prepaid account. Accordingly, the Bureau has included such terms as “opening” or “choosing to be paid” in the commentary to clarify the point in time at which consumers acquire a prepaid account in circumstances other than the retail scenario. The Bureau is finalizing comment 18(b)(1)(i)-1.i, which includes an example of the acquisition timing requirements in the context of a bank branch, largely as proposed, with minor revisions for conformity with changes elsewhere in § 1005.18(b).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For similar reasons, the Bureau has revised comment 18(b)(1)(i)-1.ii to clarify that, in the payroll card account context, a consumer who is provided with a payroll card and the disclosures required by § 1005.18(b) at the time he or she learns that he or she can receive wages via a payroll card account, but before the consumer chooses to receive wages via a payroll card account, is provided with the disclosures prior to acquisition. The final comment explains that, if a consumer receives the disclosures after the consumer receives the first payroll payment on the payroll card, those disclosures were provided post-acquisition, in violation of § 1005.18(b)(1)(i).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As above with respect to the timing of acquisition of a government benefit card, the Bureau has attempted to strike a balance that ensures that employees receive the new disclosures early enough to inform their payment choices, thereby furthering the goals of the compulsory use prohibition in § 1005.10(e)(2), while minimizing the potential disruption to current employer practices. Further, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.10(e)(2) above, the Bureau believes it is important that consumers have a choice with respect to how they receive their wages or salary. Accordingly, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to adopt a rule requiring financial institutions to provide their new disclosures before the consumer chooses a method of payment. Under the final rule, therefore, consumers must receive both the short form and long form disclosures (which include on the short form disclosure a notice informing consumers they have other options besides the payroll card account to receive their wages) before they choose the payment method that is best for them.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau declines to require a mandatory waiting period between the time consumers receive the disclosures and the time they are required to elect a payment method, for the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analyses of §§ 1005.10(e)(2) and 1005.15(c) above. Specifically, the Bureau does not believe that it is necessary at this time to specify a single time period that would apply in all enrollment scenarios.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Further, the Bureau is aware that, as noted by an employer commenter and as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.10(e)(2) above, consumers are sometimes given a choice between two or more payment alternatives, but may fail to indicate their preference. Depending on the facts and circumstances—for example, the date by which the consumer has to be paid her wages under State law—it may be reasonable for a financial institution or other person in this scenario to employ a reasonable default enrollment method. However, the Bureau is concerned about reports from consumer group commenters of employees being coerced to accept payroll card accounts as their default method of receiving wages and intends to monitor the payroll card account market for compliance with the compulsory use prohibition and will consider further action in a future rulemaking if necessary. As stated above, the Bureau also believes that by requiring the disclosures to be provided before a consumer acquires a prepaid account, the final rule will help ensure that all prepaid consumers, including employees receiving payroll card accounts, have the information they need to evaluate the prepaid account option (or options) available to them.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to proposed comment 18(b)(1)(i)-2, regarding the timing for delivery of disclosures provided electronically, the Bureau understands that the digital wallet acquisition process may in some respects be different than the acquisition process for other prepaid accounts. However, the Bureau does not believe that this warrants different treatment for purposes of the timing requirement for delivery of pre-acquisition disclosures. In particular, the Bureau notes that the fact that a digital wallet consumer could receive the disclosures before the wallet holds any funds is not unique to digital wallets. Indeed, to qualify as a prepaid account, an account must be issued on a prepaid basis <em data-original="E-03">or</em> be capable of being loaded with funds after acquisition.<footnote ref="382">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; final § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;).</footnote>
             The Bureau believes that it is important that consumers are informed of the fees and other key terms that will apply to their prepaid account before they open or purchase that account, whether that account is accessed by a physical prepaid card, a digital wallet, or through some other means. Furthermore, the Bureau understands that digital wallet providers presently provide some disclosures (for instance, user agreements and privacy policies) prior to a consumer opening an account. Thus, the Bureau does not believe that requiring digital wallet providers to provide the short form and long form disclosures before the consumer opens the account should be problematic for financial institutions or confusing to consumers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Next, the Bureau has removed the reference in proposed comment 18(b)(1)(i)-2 to a consumer's provision of personally identifiable information. The Bureau understands that there may be scenarios in which a consumer provides personal information, such as name or address, in order to obtain more information about a particular product. Likewise, there could be instances where a consumer provides personal information for one purpose online, and that information is then used for other purposes, such as to market a prepaid account to the consumer. In either scenario, the consumer did not provide the personal information in order to acquire the prepaid account. Final comment 18(b)(1)(i)-2, therefore, no longer states that a consumer who receives the disclosures after the consumer provides personally identifiable information has received the disclosures post-acquisition. Instead, the comment states that the disclosures required by § 1005.18(b) may be provided before or after a consumer has initiated the acquisition process. If the disclosures are presented after a consumer initiates the acquisition process such disclosures are made pre-acquisition if the consumer receives them before choosing to accept the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, with respect to consumer groups' requests that the Bureau clarify that a consumer must be shown both the short form and long form disclosures prior to a consumer's acquisition of a prepaid account through electronic means, the Bureau has added several examples in final comment 18(b)(1)(i)-2 to illustrate disclosure methods that would comply with final § 1005.18(b)(1)(i). In the first example, set forth in new paragraph i, the financial institution presents the short form, long form, and § 1005.18(b)(5) disclosures on the same Web page, which the consumer must view before choosing to accept the prepaid account. In the second example, set forth in new paragraph ii, the financial institution presents the short form and § 1005.18(b)(5) disclosures on one Web page, together with a link that directs the consumer to a separate Web page containing the long form disclosure, which the consumer must also view before choosing to accept the prepaid account. Finally, in the third example, set forth in new paragraph iii, the financial institution presents on a Web page the short form and § 1005.18(b)(5) disclosures, followed by the initial disclosures required by § 1005.7(b) containing the long form disclosure in accordance with final § 1005.18(f)(1), on the same Web page. The financial institution includes a link, after the short form disclosure or as part of the statement required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiii), that directs the consumer to the section of the initial disclosures containing the long form disclosure. The consumer must view this Web page containing the two disclosures prior to choosing to accept the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>These comments are intended to clarify that a consumer does not receive electronic disclosures prior to acquisition if the consumer is able to bypass some or all of the § 1005.18(b) disclosures before choosing to accept the prepaid account. The Bureau agrees with the consumer group commenter that language in the proposed comment regarding whether or not the consumer could review unrelated information before reviewing the long form disclosure on a separate Web page potentially contradicted this general principle. Accordingly, the Bureau has removed that language from the commentary to the final rule.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition to the revisions discussed above, the Bureau is finalizing certain other minor changes to comments 18(b)(1)(i)-1 and -2 for clarity and consistency.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>4(c) Charges Excluded From the Finance Charge</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1026.4(c) provides a list of charges that are excluded from the definition of finance charge under § 1026.4. The charges listed in existing § 1026.4(c) include: (1) Application fees charged to all applicants for credit, whether or not credit is actually extended; (2) charges for actual unanticipated late payment, for exceeding a credit limit, or for delinquency, default, or a similar occurrence; (3) charges imposed by a financial institution for paying items that overdraw an account, unless the payment of such items and the imposition of the charge were previously agreed upon in writing; and (4) fees charged for participation in a credit plan, whether assessed on an annual or other periodic basis.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The proposal would have provided that the exclusion from the definition of finance charge in existing § 1026.4(c)(3) for overdraft services on checking accounts would not have applied to credit accessed by a prepaid card. It also would have provided that the exclusion for participation fees in existing § 1026.4(c)(4) would not apply to credit accessed by a prepaid card.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the <em data-original="E-03">Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z</em> section, many industry commenters urged the Bureau to provide that the exception in § 1026.4(c)(3) applies to overdraft credit accessed in connection with prepaid accounts. One credit union service organization also indicated that the Bureau should provide that the exception in existing § 1026.4(c)(4) should apply to annual and other periodic fees to hold a credit plan in connection with a prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Several consumer group commenters stated that the exception in § 1026.4(c)(1) for application fees for credit features should not apply to credit accessed by prepaid cards. One consumer group commenter urged that the exceptions in existing § 1026.4(c)(2) for late fees, over the limit fees, and returned payment fees should not apply to credit accessed by prepaid cards. This commenter expressed concern that prepaid account issuers might use such fees as a back-end method of credit pricing, and stated that the Bureau should either include these fees in definition of “finance charge” or make clear that they cannot be charged on prepaid accounts.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail below, the Bureau is amending existing § 1026.4 and its commentary to provide that the exclusion in existing § 1026.4(c)(3) does not apply to credit offered in connection with a prepaid account and that the exclusion in existing § 1026.4(c)(4) does not apply to a fee to participate in a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61, regardless of whether this fee is imposed on the credit feature or on the asset feature of the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has not adopted any changes to the exception in existing § 1026.4(c)(1) related to application fees, or to the exception in existing § 1026.4(c)(2) related to late fees, over the limit fees, returned check fees, and other fees for delinquency, default, or a similar occurrence. The Bureau believes these changes are outside the scope of the proposal and does not believe that these changes are warranted at this time. The Bureau will continue to monitor whether changes to these exceptions with respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards are needed.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(b)(2)(viii) Statements Regarding Additional Fee Types</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The proposal would have required two distinct disclosures in the short form designed to alert consumers to other fees financial institutions may charge in addition to the standardized static fees disclosed at the top of the short form. First, following the static fee disclosures, pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">8</em>), the proposed short form would have disclosed up to three fees incurred most frequently by consumers of that particular prepaid card program that were not otherwise disclosed on the short form (referred to as incidence-based fees). Second, pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">10</em>), the short form would have included a statement in bold-faced type near the bottom of the disclosure stating: “We charge [X] other fees not listed here.” As described further below, the Bureau believed that these two elements would help emphasize to consumers that the short form disclosure was not a comprehensive list of all fees, provide consumers with specific information about the additional fees that they were most likely to encounter, and encourage consumers to review the long form disclosure or otherwise seek additional information about the prepaid account's features and costs.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed further below in connection with both final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii) and (ix), the Bureau is adopting both proposed disclosures with substantial revisions and is placing them together on the short form to provide greater clarity to consumers and enhance the impact of each disclosure relative to the proposed version. Other adjustments to the final rule to improve consumer comprehension and reduce implementation burdens for financial institutions include, for example, requiring disclosure of the number of additional types of fees charged in connection with the prepaid account program, rather than counting each variation in fees toward the total as proposed, and requiring disclosure of specific fee types on the short form based on revenue, rather than frequency, and only if in excess of a de minimis threshold. The Bureau believes that these and other changes will make the disclosures easier for financial institutions to prepare and more meaningful for consumers.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>In proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">10</em>), the Bureau proposed to require financial institutions to disclose on the short form a statement regarding the number of fees that could be imposed upon a consumer, in a form substantially similar to the clause set forth in proposed Model Forms A-10(a) through (d). The number of fees would have been derived from those listed on the comprehensive long form disclosure pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii)(A), other than those listed in the short form pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) through (<em data-original="E-03">8</em>).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau sought comment on whether the proposed disclosure would be useful to consumers or whether listing the total number of additional fees without any other information would actually interfere with consumers' ability to make an informed choice between prepaid account programs. The Bureau acknowledged that there was some risk that consumers might assume that the additional fees were punitive, rather than covering the cost of optional services or product features that the consumer might find advantageous. However, the Bureau also noted that some participants in the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing reported finding out about fees only after purchasing their card, and sometimes only after incurring them.<footnote ref="397">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report I at 7.</footnote>
             On balance, the Bureau believed that disclosing in the short form a statement indicating exactly how many additional fees could apply would encourage consumers to seek out more information about a prepaid account before acquisition.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Unlike the proposed incidence-based fees, the Bureau did not believe it was necessary to propose provisions about updating this statement regarding other fees. Pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(f), a financial institution would have been required to include the long form disclosure in a prepaid account's § 1005.7(b)(5) initial disclosures. Any updates made to the fees disclosed in the long form would have required an overhaul of all of the disclosures for a given prepaid account product, which the Bureau believed was unlikely to occur. Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">10</em>)-1 would have provided examples of how to comply with proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">10</em>). Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">10</em>)-2 would have provided guidance about how to count the total number of fees to disclose pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">10</em>). Specifically, the proposed comment would have clarified that, if the fee a financial institution imposes might vary, even if the variation is based on a consumer's choice of how to utilize a particular service, the financial institution must count each variation of the fee that might be imposed as a separate fee. The proposed comment also would have provided an example illustrating this concept. Finally, the proposed comment would have explained that, even if a fee could be waived under certain conditions, it would still be counted in order to comply with proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">10</em>).</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Several consumer groups generally supported this portion of the proposed short form disclosure as beneficial to alert consumers to fees not disclosed in the short form and to encourage financial institutions to simplify their fee schedules, although some groups also advocated providing a paper long-form disclosure in all settings to ensure that consumers could immediately review more detailed information about any additional fees.<footnote ref="398">For a discussion of the reasons the Bureau is requiring both a short form and a long form disclosure but is not requiring a written disclosure of all fees in all acquisition settings, see the section-by-section analyses of § 1005.18(b) and (b)(1)(ii) and (iii) respectively.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A number of industry commenters, including trade associations, issuing banks, and program managers, recommended eliminating the proposed disclosure of the number of additional fees charged. In its place, many of these commenters favored a general statement that other fees are charged, generally with reference to the cardholder agreement for more information about these other fees. One trade association and an issuing bank stated that they found the proposed disclosure rational and reasonable, as it provided useful data to consumers without overwhelming them with information and without overcrowding the short form disclosure, though they also preferred a requirement simply to state that additional fees could apply.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Many of these industry commenters expressed concern that presenting the number of fees would tend to mislead and confuse consumers and thus interfere with consumers' ability to make an informed choice among prepaid account programs. Several industry commenters said that the statement would mislead consumers into believing that these other fees are common fees they are likely to incur when in fact the commenters asserted that the fees may only be charged in connection with optional specialized services. Other industry commenters said that the number of other fees could mislead and confuse consumers into thinking that a product with a higher number of available functions—and fees for those functions—is more expensive or otherwise inferior to a product with fewer other fees, when in fact the opposite may be true. Some industry commenters warned that this stigmatized perception of a higher number of other fees and commensurate costs to update the disclosures may undermine innovation and flexibility, as financial institutions may either discontinue or cease developing new and flexible services that may be advantageous to consumers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Similarly, one of the consumer groups that recommended disclosure of all fees in all acquisition settings noted that an account that has many more other fees may actually charge fewer fees for the services it has in common with another account, but the proposed short form would make it seem as though it was potentially a more costly product. The consumer group recommended that the Bureau monitor the effect of requiring only the listing of the number of “other” fees on market innovation and the cost and types of fees that are charged.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>An issuing bank agreed that the disclosure of the number of additional fees charged can be a factor for consumers in comparing prepaid account terms, but also challenged the methodology of counting each fee variation as a separate fee. It said this methodology could be misleading to consumers as it will lead to an artificial overstatement of the total number of fees. It said that services like bill payment, which may have standard and expedited delivery and are designed to be flexible and offer the most choice and control to consumers, will make the product appear undesirable, as the number of additional fees will be inflated. Instead, it recommended counting fee types rather than individual fee variations within fee types. Two trade associations and two other issuing banks also recommended against counting each fee variation as a separate fee, agreeing that it might unnecessarily increase the number of other fees without commensurate benefit for consumers.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">10</em>), renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii), with substantial modifications, largely in response to comments received. First, the Bureau is locating together both disclosures dealing with fees not otherwise disclosed in the short form: The number of such fees required pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii) and the disclosure of certain such fees (referred to in the proposal as incidence-based fees) pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). Second, instead of requiring disclosure of the number of additional <em data-original="E-03">fees,</em> including all fee variations, the Bureau is requiring disclosure of the number of additional <em data-original="E-03">fee types.</em>
            <footnote ref="399">See final comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-2 for an explanation of the term “fee type” and a list of examples of fee types and fee variations within those fee types.</footnote>
             Third, instead of requiring the number of additional fees that could be imposed on a consumer in general, the Bureau is limiting this disclosure to the number of additional fee types that the financial institution may charge consumers with respect to the prepaid account. Fourth, the Bureau is requiring disclosure of an additional statement if a financial institution discloses additional fee types pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) that directs consumers to the disclosure of those additional fee types that follows. Fifth, the Bureau has relocated the statement regarding the number of additional fee types from the bottom portion of the proposed short form disclosure to a more clearly delineated “additional fee types” portion that follows the static fees.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau is not adopting any of the proposed commentary, but rather is adopting new comments 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-1 through -4 and 18(b)(2)(viii)(B)-1 to clarify various issues regarding application of the final rule.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>31(a)(3) Oral Disclosures for Oral Telephone Transactions</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Relying upon authority in EFTA section 919(a)(5)(A), proposed § 205.31(a)(3) permitted the pre-payment disclosures to be provided orally if the transaction was conducted entirely by telephone and if the remittance transfer provider complied with the foreign language disclosure requirements of proposed § 205.31(g)(2), discussed below. One industry commenter opposed the oral disclosure authorization for telephone transactions, arguing that the length of time to process a transfer made by telephone would increase significantly due to the number of items that must be disclosed orally. Because the Bureau believes the statute intends for senders to receive pre-payment disclosures regardless of the format of the transaction, the Bureau is permitting oral pre-payment disclosures in certain circumstances in § 1005.31(a)(3) of the final rule. Moreover, as discussed below, the Bureau is permitting in § 1005.31(a)(5) the pre-payment disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(1) to be disclosed orally or via mobile application or text message for transactions conducted entirely by telephone via mobile application or text message. Therefore, the final rule is limiting the application of § 1005.31(a)(3) to transactions conducted through oral conversations. Therefore, § 1005.31(a)(3)(i) is amended to clarify that § 1005.31(a)(3) only applies if the transaction is conducted orally and entirely by telephone. The final rule also adds comment 31(a)(3)-2 to clarify that § 1005.31(a)(3) applies to transactions conducted orally and entirely by telephone, such as transactions conducted orally on a landline or mobile telephone.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The final rule also adds another condition for providers to be permitted to disclose pre-payment disclosures orally, in addition to the requirements that the transaction be conducted entirely by telephone and that the provider comply with the foreign language disclosure requirements of § 1005.31(g)(2). The Bureau believes that for oral telephone transactions, senders should be informed of their cancellation rights before the cancellation period has passed. Because a receipt may be mailed to a sender for telephone transactions, <em data-original="E-03">see</em> § 1005.31(e)(2), the sender would not receive the abbreviated statement about the sender's cancellation rights required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) until after the cancellation period had passed. Therefore, the Bureau is requiring in § 1005.31(a)(3) that a provider disclose orally a statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) pursuant to the timing requirements in § 1005.31(e)(1) in order to disclose the pre-payment disclosures orally for oral telephone transactions.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(a)(3)-1 stated that, for transactions conducted partially by telephone, disclosures may not be provided orally. For example, a sender may begin a remittance transfer at a remittance transfer provider's dedicated phone in a retail store, and then provide payment in person to a store clerk to complete the transaction. In such cases, the proposed comment clarified that all disclosures must be provided in writing. Proposed comment 31(a)(3)-1 clarified that for such a transaction, a provider may comply with the disclosure requirements by providing the written pre-payment disclosure in person prior to the sender's payment for the transaction, and the written receipt when payment is made for the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters argued that the Bureau should permit oral pre-payment disclosures for these hybrid transactions. For example, one industry commenter stated that providing the information to senders at the time the sender is speaking with the remittance transfer provider would enable the sender to discuss the disclosed fees or currency delivery options. This commenter stated that it would be difficult to continue providing remittance transfers using a provider's dedicated telephone in a retail store if pre-payment disclosures could not be provided orally.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that by allowing oral disclosures only for transactions performed entirely by telephone, Congress did not intend to permit providers to satisfy the disclosure requirements orally for transactions conducted partially by telephone. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> EFTA section 919(a)(5)(A). Therefore, comment 31(a)(3)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed, with a revision to more precisely state that providing the information required by § 1005.31(b)(1) to a sender orally does not fulfill the requirement to provide the disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(1). The Bureau notes that nothing prohibits a provider from stating orally the information required to be disclosed by § 1005.31(b)(1) to a sender, even though this would not fulfill a provider's pre-payment disclosure requirements.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>31(a)(3) Disclosures for Oral Telephone Transactions</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(e)(1) states that a remittance transfer provider must provide the pre-payment disclosure when the sender requests the remittance transfer, but prior to payment for the transfer. Section 1005.31(a)(3) permits providers to make these pre-payment disclosures orally if the “transaction is conducted orally and entirely by telephone” and if certain other language and disclosure requirements are met. The Bureau recognized in the April Proposal that a provider may be uncertain as to how to comply with the timing requirements set forth in § 1005.31(e)(1) where a sender is neither physically present nor in “real time” communication with a provider's staff. To provide further clarification, the Bureau proposed to revise comment 31(a)(3)-2 to set forth that a remittance transfer provider may treat a written or electronic communication as an inquiry when it believes that treating the communication as a request would be impractical. In such circumstances, as long as the provider otherwise conducted the transaction orally and entirely by telephone, the provider could provide disclosures orally as permitted by § 1005.31(a)(3). The Bureau also proposed two conforming edits to comments 31(a)(3)-1 and 31(e)-1 to accommodate this change: the proposed revision to 31(a)(3)-1 would have distinguished the scenario proposed in revised 31(a)(3)-2 from a situation in which a sender requests a remittance transfer in person; the revision to 31(e)-1 would have clarified that a sender has not requested a remittance transfer for purposes of triggering the timing requirements set forth in § 1005.31(e)(1) where the provider treats the request as an inquiry.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>All commenters who commented on this part of the Proposal generally supported the Bureau's proposed revisions, with the majority of commenters expressing support without reservation. Some commenters provided additional, specific feedback. For example, one consumer group stated that it supported the proposed revision only if the consumer who made the initial request in writing received a disclosure that his request was being treated as an inquiry. A number of trade associations sought additional illustrations of when it would be “impractical” for a provider to treat a communication as a request for a transfer. Finally, one community bank proposed that the Bureau allow providers to provide oral disclosures whenever a sender so requests.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is finalizing the revisions as proposed with one change to improve clarity (specifically, removing “For example”). The Bureau declines to adopt the suggestion that providers be allowed to give oral disclosures whenever a sender opts for oral disclosures. As stated in its February 2012 <em data-original="E-04">Federal Register</em> notice, the Bureau believes that Congress did not intend to permit remittance transfer providers to satisfy the disclosure requirements orally, except in limited scenarios, as set forth in the Remittance Rule and in this final rule.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>With respect to the comment that a remittance transfer provider should be required to inform the sender that the provider is treating the sender's communication as an inquiry, the Bureau does not believe this additional, independent disclosure requirement is necessary. By definition, the provider provides the pre-payment disclosure before the consumer has paid for the remittance transfer; at this point in the transaction, there is little risk of consumer harm. Further, the Bureau believes the sender is likely to know and understand the status of his or her transaction in the course of the sender's subsequent oral communication with the provider. Finally, with respect to the request for further clarity regarding when it would be impractical for a provider to treat a communication as a request, the Bureau believes that the proposed comment, which the Bureau is adopting with a non-substantive change to improve its clarity, provides sufficient guidance in the form of a specific example.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(b)(2)(iii) ATM Withdrawal Fees</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>) would have addressed disclosure on the short form of ATM fees for withdrawing cash. Specifically, proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>) would have required disclosure of two fees for using an ATM to initiate a withdrawal of cash in the United States from a prepaid account, both within and outside of the financial institution's network or a network affiliated with the financial institution, using the term “ATM withdrawal fee” or a substantially similar term, and “in-network” or “out-of-network,” or substantially similar terms. Proposed Model Forms A-10(a) through (d) would have disclosed these ATM withdrawal fees on the top line of the short form.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau understood that the ATM fees for most prepaid accounts differ depending on whether the ATM is in a network of which the financial institution that issued the card is a member or an affiliate. Insofar as accessing ATM networks of which the issuing financial institution is not a member or an affiliate often costs the financial institution more, it typically charges a higher fee to a consumer for using that out-of-network ATM. Given that such potential variances are common, the Bureau believed that disclosure of fees for both in- and out-of-network ATMs withdrawals is important. Although the Bureau noted in the proposal that many participants during its pre-proposal consumer testing were unfamiliar with the difference between “in-network” and “out-of-network” ATMs, the Bureau believed the inclusion of these two fees on the top line of the proposed short form would highlight for consumers that such fee variations can occur and the importance of understanding the ATM network associated with a particular prepaid account program.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>)-1 would have clarified that, if the fee imposed on the consumer for using an ATM in a foreign country to initiate a withdrawal of cash is different from the fee charged for using an ATM in the United States within or outside the financial institution's network or a network affiliated with the financial institution, a financial institution must not disclose the foreign ATM fee pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>), but may be required to do so pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">8</em>) as part of the proposed incidence-based fee disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Several industry and consumer group commenters and one office of a State Attorney General commented on the Bureau's proposed ATM withdrawal fee disclosure. In response to the Bureau's question regarding whether additional information is needed on the short form to explain the distinction between in-network versus out-of-network ATMs, a prepaid program manager, an issuing bank, and an industry trade association commented that it was unnecessary to require such an explanation, asserting that consumers generally understand the terminology and if not, consumers could direct their questions to the prepaid issuer or to the Bureau. The program manager also suggested permitting disclosure of a single ATM fee if the fees for both in- and out-of-network withdrawals are the same, as well as disclosing when ATM withdrawals are not available.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The office of a State Attorney General and an industry trade association specifically addressed payroll card accounts. The office of the State Attorney General said that its research revealed that ATMs were the most common way for payroll card accountholders in its State to access their wages and that accountholders regularly incurred fees for ATM transactions. It recommended that all payroll card account programs be required to provide free and unlimited withdrawal of wages via ATMs with no third-party fees. The trade association recommended permitting disclosure in the short form of the number of free ATM withdrawals available to payroll card accountholders.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Two consumer groups and the office of the State Attorney General recommended additional ATM-related disclosures, such as the name of the ATM network and whether the prepaid account is affiliated with the network, the full extent of the network, whether third-party fees apply, whether there are limits on in-network ATM withdrawals, and the cost of international ATM transactions.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>No commenters objected to the inclusion of ATM withdrawal fees in the short form, or generally regarding distinguishing between in- and out-of-network ATM withdrawal fees.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>), renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(2)(iii), as proposed with minor technical modifications for clarity. The Bureau continues to believe it is important for consumers to know how much they will be charged to withdraw funds at an ATM and to know the difference, if any, for conducting the withdrawal at an in-network versus out-of-network ATM. The Bureau is also adopting proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>)-1, renumbered as comment 18(b)(2)(iii)-1, explaining that a financial institution may not disclose its fee (if any) for using an ATM to initiate a withdrawal of cash in a foreign country in the disclosure required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(iii), although it may be required to disclose that fee as an additional fee type pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). In response to comments requesting that additional information be added to the disclosure of ATM withdrawal fees, the Bureau declines to require disclosure of such additional information in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(iii). The Bureau believes the short form disclosure balances the most important information for consumers with the brevity and clarity necessary for optimal consumer comprehension. Moreover, much of the additional information recommended by commenters, such as third-party fees and the name and extent of the ATM network, must or may be provided in the long form disclosure. <em data-original="E-03">See, e.g.,</em> final § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) and Sample Form A-10(f).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>To address the comments recommending that the Bureau require more fulsome disclosure of the details regarding ATM fees for payroll card accounts (and similar comments made elsewhere recommending disclosure of other information in addition to ATM fees), the Bureau is finalizing new § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B), which permits inclusion of a statement in the short form disclosure for payroll card accounts directing consumers to a location outside the short form for information on how to access funds and balance information for free or for a reduced fee. Final § 1005.15(c)(2)(ii) contains a similar provision for government benefit accounts. To address the comment recommending disclosure of a single ATM fee if the fees for both in- and out-of-network withdrawals are the same (and similar comments made elsewhere regarding two-tier fee disclosures), the Bureau is finalizing new § 1005.18(b)(3)(iii), which permits a single disclosure for like fees. Regarding the comment recommending disclosure of when ATM withdrawals are not available, both proposed and final § 1005.18(b)(2) require such disclosure through use of “N/A” as discussed above. <em data-original="E-03">See also</em> final comment 18(b)(2)-1. Regarding the comment requesting that the Bureau ban fees for ATM transactions on payroll card accounts, such request is outside the scope of this rulemaking.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>31(b)(4) Long Form Error Resolution and Cancellation Notice</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(4) stated that a remittance transfer provider must provide a notice to the sender describing the sender's error resolution and cancellation rights under proposed §§ 205.33 and 205.34 upon the sender's request. As discussed above, consumer group commenters argued that comprehensive error resolution and cancellation rights should be stated on the receipt or combined disclosure in lieu of an abbreviated disclosure, and not only upon request by a sender. The Bureau is retaining the abbreviated disclosure in the final rule. However, the Bureau also believes that a sender must have access to a complete description of the sender's error resolution and cancellation rights.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The requirement to provide a long form error resolution and cancellation notice is adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(b)(4). The final rule adds the requirement that the notice must be provided promptly to the sender. The Bureau believes that adding a timing requirement to the provision will ensure that providers do not delay in providing the notice to a sender, and the requirement to provide notices promptly is consistent with other provisions in Regulation E. <em data-original="E-03">See, e.g.,</em> § 1005.11(d)(1). Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(4) states that, upon the sender's request, a remittance transfer provider must promptly provide to the sender a notice describing the sender's error resolution and cancellation rights, using language set forth in Model Form A-36 of Appendix A to this part or substantially similar language. As discussed above with respect to § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv), the Bureau is adding a requirement in § 1005.31(b)(4) to account for the alternative cancellation requirements in § 1005.36(c) for remittance transfers scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, as discussed below. Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(4) also provides that for any remittance transfer scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, a description of the rights of the sender regarding cancellation must instead reflect the requirements of § 1005.36(c).</analysisParagraph>

In addition, the Bureau has revised the order of the model and sample forms in the final rule to include all short form disclosures together as Model Forms A-10(a) through (e) and the long form disclosure as Sample Form A-10(f). The Bureau has also removed the proposed sample long form disclosure for prepaid accounts that offer multiple service plans to provide greater flexibility to industry to develop its own designs.

Pursuant to existing comment -2, financial institutions and remittance transfer providers have the option of using the model disclosure clauses provided in appendix A to facilitate compliance with the disclosure requirements enumerated in the comment. The comment also explains how the use of the appropriate clauses provided in appendix A will protect a financial institution and a remittance transfer provider from liability under sections 916 and 917 of EFTA, provided the clauses accurately reflect the institution's EFT services and the provider's remittance transfer services, respectively. In this final rule, the Bureau is updating the enumerated disclosure requirements in comment -2 to reflect changes to the numbering of § 1005.15 and § 1005.18 in the final rule and to add the provisions for new disclosure requirements included in the final rule.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also is updating existing comment -3 in the commentary to appendix A (Appendix A—Model Disclosure Clauses and Forms).

The Bureau is adding a sentence to comment -3 to clarify that the alterations set forth in the comment apply, unless otherwise expressly addressed in the rule. The Bureau is adding this sentence to clarify the alterations permitted under existing comment -3 may not apply to certain disclosures pursuant to this final rule.

          <title>Subpart B—Requirements for Remittance Transfers</title>
          <analysisParagraph>On February 7, 2012, the Bureau published a final rule implementing section 1073 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which added section 919 to EFTA to establish consumer protections for remittance transfers sent by consumers in the United States to individuals and businesses in foreign countries.<footnote ref="557">77 FR 6194 (Feb. 7, 2012). This rule was subsequently amended. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 77 FR 40459 (July 10, 2012), 77 FR 50244 (Aug. 20, 2012), 78 FR 6025 (Jan. 29, 2013), 78 FR 30662 (May 22, 2013), 78 FR 49365 (Aug. 14, 2013), and 79 FR 55970 (Sept. 18, 2014) (collectively, the Remittance Rule).</footnote>
             Among other things, EFTA section 919 requires the following protections for covered transactions sent by remittance transfer providers: (i) the provision of disclosures prior to and at the time of payment by the sender of the transfer; (ii) cancellation and refund rights; and (iii) the investigation and remedy of errors by providers. It also establishes liability standards for providers for the acts of their agents. The final rule implemented these provisions in new subpart B of Regulation E.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>A remittance transfer is the electronic transfer of funds requested by a sender to a designated recipient that is sent by a remittance transfer provider, regardless of whether the sender holds an account with the provider, and regardless of whether the transaction is also an EFT, as defined in § 1005.3(b).<footnote ref="558">§ 1005.30(e).</footnote>
             A designated recipient is any person specified by the sender as the authorized recipient of a remittance transfer to be received at a location in a foreign country.<footnote ref="559">§ 1005.30(c).</footnote>
             A sender is a consumer in a State who primarily for personal, family, or household purposes requests a remittance transfer provider to send a remittance transfer to a designated recipient.<footnote ref="560">§ 1005.30(g).</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>In order to assess whether a consumer is a sender or whether an authorized recipient is a designated recipient, the location of where the funds are sent from and the location of where the funds are sent to are determinative. If the transfer is sent from an account (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> a consumer transfers $100 out of the consumer's checking account) or to an account (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> a consumer sends $100 in cash to a family's member's bank account in a foreign country), the location of the account determines where the funds are being, as applicable, sent from or sent to. To illustrate, existing comment 30(c)-2.ii explains that if a recipient's account is located in a State, the funds will not be received at a location in a foreign country.<footnote ref="561">An account located on a U.S. military installation that is physically located in a foreign country is located in a State. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; comments 30(c)-2.ii and 30(g)-1.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>With respect to products such as prepaid cards (other than prepaid cards that were already accounts under Regulation E) and digital wallets; however, the Remittance Rule does not treat those products as accounts.<footnote ref="562">77 FR 6194, 6207 (explaining that where the funds that can be accessed by a prepaid card are held does not determine whether funds are being sent to a designated recipient because a prepaid card is generally not considered to be an account as defined in § 1005.2(b)).</footnote>
             Because these products were not previously considered to be accounts as defined in § 1005.2(b) of current Regulation E, the Remittance Rule directs that one must look at where the funds are being sent from to determine if a consumer is a sender and where the funds are being sent to in order to determine if the person receiving the funds is a designated recipient. In other words, the location of the consumer sending the funds determines where the funds are being sent from, and the location of the person receiving the funds determines where the funds are received. To illustrate, existing comment 30(c)-2.iii explains that if a consumer in a State purchases a prepaid card, the remittance transfer provider has sufficient information to conclude that funds are to be received in a foreign country if the provider sends the prepaid card to a specified recipient in a foreign country.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>As the Bureau noted in the proposal, the definition of prepaid account would mean that certain prepaid products such as GPR cards and certain digital wallets would be considered accounts under Regulation E. Yet, the Bureau also noted that it did not intend to change how the Remittance Rule applied to prepaid products. Accordingly, the Bureau sought comments on whether additional clarification or guidance is necessary with respect to the Remittance Rule. Although the Bureau did not receive comments on this aspect of the proposal, the Bureau believes that to facilitate compliance, it is necessary to clarify that for prepaid accounts other than payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts, the location of these accounts does not determine where funds are being sent to or from. Accordingly, this final rule contains clarifying and conforming revisions to comments 30(c)-2.ii and 30(g)-1 to clarify that transfers involving a prepaid account (other than a prepaid account that is a payroll card account or a government benefit account) are not transfers from an account or to an account. For the same reason, this final rule also amends § 1005.32(a), as discussed in greater detail below.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(b)(1)(iii) Disclosures for Prepaid Accounts Acquired Orally by Telephone</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Similar to the proposed alternative for retail stores, the Bureau proposed § 1005.18(b)(1)(iii) to provide that before a consumer acquired a prepaid account orally by telephone, a financial institution would have to disclose orally the short form information that would have been required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i). Proposed § 1005.18(b)(1)(iii) would have further stated that a financial institution could provide a written or electronic long form disclosure required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii) after a consumer acquired a prepaid account orally by telephone if the financial institution communicated to a consumer orally, before a consumer acquired the prepaid account, that the information required to be disclosed by § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii) was available orally by telephone and on a Web site. The Bureau believed that as long as consumers were made aware of their ability to access the information contained in the long form disclosure, they would be able to get enough information to make an informed acquisition decision. Those who wished to learn more about the prepaid account could do so, and financial institutions would not be unduly burdened by having to provide the long form disclosure orally to all consumers who acquire prepaid accounts by telephone. A version of the long form disclosure, however, would have still been required to be provided after acquisition in the prepaid account's initial disclosures, pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(f).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 18(b)(1)(iii)-1 would have explained that, for purposes of proposed § 1005.18(b)(1)(iii), a prepaid account was considered to have been acquired orally by telephone when a consumer spoke to a customer service agent or communicated with an automated system, such as an interactive voice response system, to provide personally identifiable payment information to acquire a prepaid account, but would have clarified that prepaid accounts acquired using a mobile device without speaking to a customer service agent or communicating with an automated system were not considered to have been acquired orally by telephone. The Bureau believed that, if a consumer used a smartphone to access a mobile application to acquire a prepaid account, and did not receive disclosures about the prepaid account orally, the disclosures could be provided electronically pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(i)(B). The Bureau believed that in such a scenario the logistical challenges justifying an alternative timing requirement for accounts acquired orally by telephone were not present.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 18(b)(1)(iii)-2 would have explained how disclosures provided orally could comply with the pre-acquisition timing requirement in proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i). Specifically, proposed comment 18(b)(1)(iii)-2 would have clarified that to comply with the pre-acquisition requirement set forth in proposed § 1005.18(b)(1)(i) for prepaid accounts acquired orally by telephone, a financial institution may, for example, read the disclosures required under proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) over the telephone after a consumer had initiated the purchase of a prepaid account by calling the financial institution, but before a consumer agreed to acquire the prepaid account. Proposed comment 18(b)(1)(iii)-2 would have also explained that although the disclosure required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii) was not required to be given pre-acquisition when a consumer acquired a prepaid account orally by telephone, a financial institution would still have to communicate to a consumer that the long form disclosure was available upon request, either orally by telephone or on a Web site. Finally, the proposed comment would have clarified that a financial institution must provide information on all fees in the terms and conditions as required by existing § 1005.7(b)(5), as modified by proposed § 1005.18(f), before the first EFT was made from a consumer's prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One consumer group commenter urged the Bureau to provide consumers who acquire a prepaid account by telephone or electronically the option of receiving written disclosures by mail upon request. The Bureau notes that consumers acquiring prepaid accounts through these methods must still receive the initial disclosures required by § 1005.7, which, as modified by final § 1005.18(f)(1), must include all of the information required to be disclosed in its pre-acquisition long form disclosure pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(4). Accordingly, the Bureau does not believe it is necessary to separately provide consumers the right to request a written copy of information they are already required to receive under existing § 1005.7 and final § 1005.18(f)(1).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is therefore adopting § 1005.18(b)(1)(iii) and its related commentary largely as proposed, with a few minor revisions. Under final § 1005.18(b)(1)(iii), a financial institution is not required to provide the long form disclosure required by § 1005.18(b)(4) before a consumer acquires a prepaid account orally by telephone if the following conditions are met: (A) The financial institution communicates to the consumer orally, before the consumer acquires the prepaid account, that the long form disclosure is available both by telephone and on a Web site; (B) the financial institution makes the long form disclosure available both by telephone and on a Web site; and (C) the long form disclosures are provided after the consumer acquires the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau continues to believe that it is appropriate to modify the proposed general pre-acquisition disclosure requirements when a consumer acquires a prepaid account orally by telephone, and that requiring disclosure of only limited information by telephone will increase the likelihood that a consumer will understand any information about the prepaid account when acquiring it orally by telephone. The Bureau believes that, since the final rule mandates that consumers be made aware of their ability to access the information contained in the long form disclosure, consumers will have access to enough information to make an informed acquisition decision.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As stated above, the Bureau is finalizing several modifications to § 1005.18(b)(1)(iii) and its commentary. First, the Bureau has added language to comment 18(b)(1)(iii)-2 to clarify that a financial institution can meet the requirements of final § 1005.18(b)(1)(iii) by providing the required disclosures over the telephone using an interactive voice response or similar system. Second, for the same reason the Bureau is adopting new § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii)(D) above, the Bureau is adopting new § 1005.18(b)(1)(iii)(C) to clarify that, to qualify for the telephone exception, the financial institution would have to provide the long form disclosure after the consumer acquires the prepaid account. Again, while this new provision does not set forth a specific time by which the long form disclosure must be provided after acquisition, the Bureau expects that compliance with § 1005.18(b)(1)(iii)(C) will typically be accomplished through delivery of the long form disclosure as part of the initial disclosures required by § 1005.7, in accordance with final § 1005.18(f)(1). Finally, the Bureau has made certain other revisions to § 1005.18(b)(1)(iii) and its commentary to streamline and clarify the language therein.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>31(b)(3) Combined Disclosure</title>
      <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(5)(C) grants the Bureau authority to permit a remittance transfer provider to provide to a sender a single written disclosure instead of the pre-payment disclosure and receipt, if the information disclosed is accurate at the time at which payment is made. The combined disclosure must include the content provided in the pre-payment disclosure and the receipt under EFTA sections 919(a)(2)(A) and (B). As discussed above, the Bureau is also requiring providers to disclose some information in the pre-payment disclosure and receipt, such as the transfer amount, that is not specifically required by EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A) or (B). The Board determined through consumer testing that participants understood the information provided on the combined disclosure, and about half of the participants stated that they would prefer to receive the single, combined disclosure rather than a pre-payment disclosure and a separate receipt. Therefore, proposed § 205.31(b)(3) generally permitted a remittance transfer provider to provide the disclosures described in proposed § 205.31(b)(1) and (2) in a single disclosure prior to payment, as applicable, as an alternative to providing the two disclosures described in proposed § 205.31(b)(1) and (2).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters urged the Bureau not to permit combined disclosures. One consumer group commenter stated that requiring both a pre-payment disclosure and a receipt would permit consumers to audit the transaction and ensure that providers do not impose hidden fees. This commenter noted that the combined disclosure would not likely reduce compliance burdens for providers because State laws may already mandate a post-transaction receipt. Another consumer group commenter argued that two disclosures were necessary to perform two different legal functions. This commenter stated that a pre-transaction disclosure serves as an offer that provides terms of written contract, and a receipt indicates that the contract has been agreed upon. This commenter believed a combined disclosure would be too confusing to senders and that the proposed rule did not address how the combined disclosure will ensure information is accurate. Some industry commenters argued that the Bureau should permit the combined disclosure, but maintained that it should be permitted to be provided after payment is made. <em data-original="E-03">See also</em> § 1005.31(e), discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Some consumer testing participants stated that they would prefer to receive a pre-payment disclosure and a receipt because they were concerned that the combined disclosure would not provide proof of payment for the remittance transfer. Therefore, in the proposal, the Board solicited comment on whether proof of payment should also be required for remittance transfer providers using the combined disclosure and, if so, solicited comment on appropriate methods of demonstrating proof of payment for the combined disclosure. Consumer group commenters contended that methods for providing proof of payment could not be adequately set forth in the final rule. An industry commenter argued against requiring proof of payment for the combined disclosure, based on the challenges posed by the required timing of combined disclosures. Another industry commenter maintained that senders were satisfied with the existing proof of payment provided to them.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes a combined disclosure has benefits. Based on the Board's consumer testing, the Bureau believes that senders will understand the combined disclosures provided to them and that some senders will prefer to receive disclosures in a combined format. As discussed with respect to § 1005.31(f), below, the provider must ensure that the combined disclosure is accurate when payment is made. Moreover, the Bureau believes that the combined disclosure could reduce the compliance burden for some providers because the provider would only be required to provide one disclosure, rather than two, with mandated content in a specified format. Therefore, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to permit this alternative disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>However, the Bureau also believes that senders need to be able to confirm that they have completed the transaction. A proof of payment enables senders to demonstrate that the combined disclosure they received was part of a completed transaction. A proof of payment would also help remittance transfer providers determine which transfers have actually been completed, so that a sender cannot assert error resolution rights based on a combined disclosure, where a sender has not made payment for the transfer. Thus, the Bureau is adding a proof of payment requirement to the final rule.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to finalize the combined disclosure requirement. Section 1005.31(b)(3) states that as an alternative to providing the disclosures described in § 1005.31(b)(1) and (2), a remittance transfer provider may provide the disclosures described in § 1005.31(b)(2), as applicable, in a single disclosure pursuant to the timing requirements of § 1005.31(e)(1). If the remittance transfer provider provides the combined disclosure and the sender completes the transfer, the remittance transfer provider must provide the sender with proof of payment when payment is made for the remittance transfer. The proof of payment must be clear and conspicuous, provided in writing or electronically, and provided in a retainable form. The final rule also adds new comment 31(b)(3)-1, which clarifies that the combined disclosure must be provided to the sender when the sender requests the remittance transfer, but prior to payment for the transfer, pursuant to § 1005.31(e)(1), and the proof of payment must be provided when payment is made for the remittance transfer. The comment also clarifies that the proof of payment for the transaction may be provided on the same piece of paper as the combined disclosure or on a separate piece of paper. For example, a provider may feed a combined disclosure through a computer printer when payment is made to add the date and time of the transaction, a confirmation code, and an indication that the transfer was paid in full. A provider may also provide this additional information to a sender on a separate piece of paper when payment is made.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that the use of the term “proof of payment” does not suggest or establish an evidentiary standard. The requirement to provide a sender with proof of payment is only intended to convey to a sender that payment has been received. To this end, new comment 31(b)(3)-1 also clarifies that a remittance transfer provider does not comply with the requirements of § 1005.31(b)(3) by providing a combined disclosure with no further indication that payment has been received.</analysisParagraph>

Section 1005.31(b)(3) provides that if the provider chooses to provide a combined disclosure, the provider must also provide the sender a proof of payment for the transfer when payment is made for the remittance transfer. As described in the February Final Rule, the Bureau issued § 1005.31(b)(3) pursuant to its authority under EFTA sections 919(a)(5)(C), and 904(a) and (c).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to the same authority, the Bureau is revising § 1005.31(b)(3) to allow a remittance transfer provider to provide a confirmation of scheduling in lieu of the proof of payment with combined disclosures for transfers scheduled before the date of transfer in order to facilitate compliance and enhance consumer protection. The Bureau is redesignating § 1005.31(b)(3) from the February Final Rule as § 1005.31(b)(3)(i) and is adopting a new § 1005.31(b)(3)(ii). Section 1005.31(b)(3)(ii) states that if the disclosure described in § 1005.31(b)(3)(i) is provided in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) (which concerns one-time transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer or the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers) and payment is not processed by the remittance transfer provider at the time the remittance transfer is scheduled, a remittance transfer provider may provide confirmation that the transaction has been scheduled in lieu of the proof of payment otherwise required by § 1005.31(b)(3)(i). The confirmation of scheduling must be clear and conspicuous, provided in writing or electronically, and provided in a retainable form.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Although the February Proposal did not propose changes to § 1005.31(b)(3), it sought comment generally on the form of disclosures for transfers scheduled before the date of transfer. 77 FR 6310, 6317. The Bureau believes that adjustments are necessary to § 1005.31(b)(3) because while comment 31(e)-2 in the final rule states that payment is made for purposes of subpart B of Regulation E when payment is authorized, this does not necessarily mean that providing “proof of payment” at the time of authorization will make sense for either the provider or the sender for a one-time remittance transfer that is scheduled before the date of transfer or the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers when payment may not be processed until closer to the date of such transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For many remittance transfers, senders tender payment for immediate processing once they authorize the remittance transfer provider to complete the transfer (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> by paying cash or by providing a payment device). In those situations, the Bureau does not believe there would be any downside for the sender or the remittance transfer provider if the provider provided proof of payment at the time that payment is made, <em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> authorized. These situations are distinct from the case in which a sender arranges with the provider to have funds deducted from the sender's account with the provider or to process a payment with a payment device at some later time, closer to the date of a transfer. In such an instance, the Bureau is concerned that providing a sender with “proof of payment” could confuse the sender. Furthermore, the Bureau is concerned that providers may not wish to provide “proof of payment” in such instances.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 31(b)(3)-2 provides additional guidance regarding the confirmation of scheduling. This comment explains that, as discussed in comment 31(e)-2, payment is considered to be made when payment is authorized for purposes of various timing requirements in subpart B, including with regard to the timing requirement for provision of the proof of payment described in § 1005.31(b)(3)(i). However, where a transfer (whether a one-time remittance transfer or the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers) is scheduled before the date of transfer and the provider does not intend to process payment until at or near the date of transfer, the provider may provide a confirmation of scheduling in lieu of the proof of payment required by § 1005.31(b)(3)(i). No further proof of payment is required when payment is later processed.</analysisParagraph>

Comment 33(a)-8 states that, for purposes of the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D), the terms account number and recipient institution identifier refer to alphanumerical account or institution identifiers other than names or addresses, such as account numbers, routing numbers, Canadian transit numbers, ISO 9362 or 13616 codes (including International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs) and Business Identifier Codes (BICs)) and other similar account or institution identifiers.  In addition, for purposes of this exception, the term designated recipient's account refers only to an account held in the recipient's name at a bank, credit union, or equivalent institution that maintains savings or checking accounts or accounts used for the purchase or sale of securities.  An account for purposes of this definition is not limited to accounts held by consumers.

      <title>32(b)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(iii)</title>
      <analysisParagraph>To accommodate the allowance for estimates of exchange rates in certain disclosures for remittance transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer, several additional provisions are included in § 1005.32(b)(2) regarding other information disclosed in pre-payment disclosures and receipts.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.32(b)(2)(ii) permitted a remittance transfer provider to estimate taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider for transfers scheduled more than ten days before the date of transfer only if those taxes were a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient and are to be disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be received. Proposed § 1005.32(b)(2)(iii)(A) similarly permitted a remittance transfer provider to estimate fees imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider for transfers scheduled more than ten days before the date of transfer only if those fees were a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient and are to be disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be received. Unlike proposed § 1005.32(b)(2)(ii), proposed § 1005.32(b)(2)(iii) contained an additional provision—§ 1005.32(b)(2)(iii)(B)—that, in effect, reasserted the temporary exception (in § 1005.32(a)) for “insured institutions” to estimate fees. Because § 1005.32(a) remains unchanged in the final rule and continues to apply regardless of the application of § 1005.32(b)(2), the Bureau believes it unnecessary to include a provision incorporating that exception.<footnote ref="14">For the same reasons, the Bureau is not adopting the proposed change to comment 32(c)(1)-1, concerning potential transmittal routes or proposed comment 32(b)(2)-1 concerned fees imposed on the remittance transfer provider by a person other than the remittance transfer provider. The Bureau received no comments regarding comment 32(b)(2)-1. Nevertheless, the Bureau is not adopting the proposed comment because it is duplicative. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; § 1005.32(a) and (b)(2)(ii). The final rule continues, in effect, to allow estimates for the fees described in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) in two circumstances: (i) Where the fees are calculated as a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2)(ii); or (ii) where an “insured institution” as defined in § 1005.32(a)(3) is permitted to estimate fees under the temporary exception in § 1005.32(a).</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As a result, there is no longer a need for separate provisions for estimation of the fees and taxes in the disclosure required under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). In place of proposed § 1005.32(b)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(iii)(A), as well as proposed comment 32(b)(2)-7, the Bureau adopts § 1005.32(b)(2)(ii), which provides that fees and taxes described in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) may be estimated under § 1005.32(b)(2)(i) only if the exchange rate is also estimated under § 1005.32(b)(2)(i) and the estimated exchange rate affects the amount of fees and taxes under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). The revised provision expands the ability to estimate fees and taxes to cover not just situations in which the tax or fee is a percentage of the amount of the funds transferred, but also to cover situations in which a tax or fee may otherwise vary depending on the exchange rate (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.</em> a tax is only charged on transfers that exceed a certain threshold denominated in the currency in which the funds will be received, and that amount depends on the exchange rate).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The final rule also includes § 1005.32(b)(2)(iii). This provision allows remittance transfer providers to estimate fees and taxes in certain disclosures provided for remittance transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer, when a remittance transfer provider agrees to a sender's request to fix the amount to be transferred in the currency in which the remittance transfer will be received and not the currency in which it is funded. But § 1005.32(b)(2)(iii) explains that fees and taxes described in § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) may be estimated under § 1005.32(b)(2)(i) only if the amount that will be transferred in the currency in which it is funded is also estimated under § 1005.32(b)(2)(i), and the estimated amount affects the amount of such fees and taxes.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Disclosure of Formulas Used To Calculate the Exchange Rate</title>
        <analysisParagraph>In the February Proposal, the Bureau sought comment on whether, in lieu of providing an estimate of the exchange rate for a remittance transfer scheduled before the date of transfer, the Bureau should allow providers to disclose a formula that will be used to calculate the exchange rate that will apply to such a transfer, and that is based on information that is publicly available prior to the time of transfer. The sender could then use that formula to calculate the exchange rate that will apply to the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several industry and consumer group commenters supported the use of such a formula although they disagreed on whether its use should be optional. One industry commenter stated that the disclosure of a formula could eliminate the need for remittance transfer providers to manage exchange rate risk and would reduce the burden on providers as compared to a rule that required providers to disclose actual exchange rates for transfers scheduled before the date of transfer. Another industry commenter favored disclosure of formulas rather than estimates for remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer because the volatility of currency markets makes disclosure of estimates of limited utility to senders trying to gauge the pricing of a particular provider's services. Other industry commenters stated that either a formula or use of estimates could reduce compliance burden on providers. One consumer group favored the use of formulas whenever the Bureau would also permit estimates on disclosures provided more than ten days before the date of transfer because formulas may make comparison shopping easier for consumers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In contrast, one industry commenter preferred disclosure of estimates to formulas because, the commenter stated, for remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer, it would be easier to provide an estimate of an exchange rate to senders and such an estimate would be easier for a sender to understand.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that, in some cases, compared to either an estimated or an actual exchange rate, a well-designed formula could better serve consumers and potentially reduce burden on remittance transfer providers. The Bureau believes that, given the nature of foreign currency markets, in many cases, any estimate of the exchange rate for a remittance transfer scheduled days or weeks in the future may not provide a highly precise indication to the sender of the exchange rate that would actually be applied to the sender's transfer. By contrast, a formula that will be used to calculate the exchange rate applicable to a transfer could provide more certainty to a sender as to relative prices or the pricing mechanism used and allow the sender to calculate the actual exchange rate that will apply to a transfer, before the date of the transfer. In addition, disclosing a formula would reduce the need for a remittance transfer provider to manage the currency risk associated with providing an accurate exchange rate for a transfer scheduled before the date of transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Nevertheless, the Bureau does not believe it is appropriate to allow for the use of formulas in disclosures at this time. First, the Bureau is concerned that the disclosure of formulas themselves could be confusing to senders if not designed in a way that consumers can understand. Second, if a formula was not required to be disclosed by all remittance transfer providers, the Bureau is concerned that consumer confusion could be a problem if some providers disclose formulas while others disclose estimates. However, the Bureau expects to continue evaluating how disclosures can most effectively inform senders without imposing undue burden on remittance transfer providers.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(b)(2)(ix) Disclosure of Additional Fee Types</title>
      <analysisParagraph>As explained at the beginning of the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii) above, the proposal would have required two distinct disclosures in the short form designed to alert consumers to other fees financial institutions may charge in addition to the standardized static fees disclosed at the top of the short form. First, following the static fee disclosures, pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">8</em>), the proposed short form would have disclosed up to three fees incurred most frequently by consumers of that particular prepaid card program that were not otherwise disclosed on the short form (referred to as incidence-based fees). Second, pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">10</em>), the short form would have disclosed a statement in bold-faced type near the bottom of the disclosure stating: “We charge [X] other fees not listed here.” As described herein, the Bureau believed that these two elements would help emphasize to consumers that the short form disclosure was not a comprehensive list of all fees, provide consumers with specific information about the additional fees that they were most likely to encounter, and encourage consumers to review the long form or otherwise seek additional information about the prepaid account's features and costs.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in connection with both final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii) and (ix), the Bureau is adopting both proposed disclosures with substantial revisions and is placing them together on the short form to provide greater clarity to consumers and enhance the impact of each disclosure relative to the proposed version. Other adjustments made to the final rule to improve consumer comprehension and reduce implementation burdens for financial institutions include, for example, requiring disclosure of the number of additional types of fees charged in connection with the prepaid account program, rather than counting each variation in fees toward the total as proposed and requiring disclosure of specific fee types on the short form based on revenue, rather than frequency, and only if in excess of a de minimis threshold. The Bureau believes that these and other changes will make the disclosures easier for financial institutions to prepare and more meaningful for consumers.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition to the fees that all financial institutions would have had to disclose in the static portion of the short form disclosure pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) through (<em data-original="E-03">7</em>), the Bureau also proposed that financial institutions disclose up to three additional “incidence-based” fees not already disclosed elsewhere on the short form that are incurred most frequently for that particular prepaid account product. If a financial institution offered several prepaid account products, the incidence-based fees analysis would have had to be conducted separately for each product, based on usage patterns in the prior 12-month period, and updated annually. Thus, the incidence-based fees that would have been disclosed to a consumer on the short form could have varied from one product to the next depending on which fees consumers incurred most frequently for each product.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed this disclosure because it was concerned that, while the fee disclosures in the static portion of the short form under the proposed rule would have included the key fees on most prepaid accounts, that list is not comprehensive and there could be other fees that consumers might incur with some frequency. The Bureau also had concerns that, absent this incidence-based disclosure, there was a risk of evasion whereby a financial institution trying to gain an advantage relative to its competitors could restructure its fee schedule to make the fees disclosed in the static portion of the short form lower, while structuring its pricing to make up or even increase overall revenue by imposing fees that would not otherwise be disclosed on the short form. The Bureau believed that requiring financial institutions to disclose other fees that are frequently paid by consumers would limit the ability of financial institutions to avoid having to disclose relevant fee information up front on the short form disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Additionally, the Bureau believed that the incidence-based portion of the short form, though it would have mandated a specific metric to determine which additional fees may be listed, would have provided some flexibility to industry participants to disclose up to three more fees on the short form particular to each prepaid account product and that may be imposed for features that could be appealing to consumers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8)(I).</em> Accordingly, proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">8</em>)(I) would generally have required disclosure of up to three fees, other than any of those fees disclosed pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) through (<em data-original="E-03">7</em>), that were incurred most frequently in the prior 12-month period by consumers of that particular prepaid account product.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For existing prepaid account products, proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">8</em>)(I) would have required that, at the same time each year, a financial institution assess whether the incidence-based fees disclosed pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">8</em>)(I) were the most frequently incurred fees in the prior 12-month period by consumers of that particular prepaid account product. In accordance with the timing requirements of proposed § 1005.18(h), a financial institution would have had to execute any updates required by the rules within 90 days for disclosures provided in written, electronic, or oral form pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(1)(i). Disclosures provided on the packaging material of prepaid account access devices, for example, in retail stores pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii), or in other locations, would have had to be revised when the financial institution printed new packaging material for its prepaid account access devices, in accordance with the timing requirements in proposed § 1005.18(h). All disclosures provided pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">8</em>)(I) and created after a financial institution makes an incidence-based fee assessment and determines changes are necessary would have had to include such changes, in accordance with the timing requirements in proposed § 1005.18(h).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believed that it was important for the incidence-based fee disclosure to list a prepaid account product's most commonly incurred fees. The Bureau, however, recognized that financial institutions would need time to update disclosures upon assessing whether any changes to the incidence-based fee disclosure are needed, although the Bureau expected such changes would be infrequent. The Bureau believed such updates would be easier for disclosures provided in electronic form or in written form outside of a retail setting. Thus, the Bureau proposed that financial institutions would have had to make updates to written, electronic, and oral disclosures within 90 days to ensure that consumers receive up-to-date incidence-based fee disclosures. The Bureau, however, recognized that it could be more complicated and time-consuming for financial institutions to make updates to packages used to market prepaid accounts in retail stores, and therefore proposed that financial institutions would have been able to implement updates on packaging material whenever they are printing new stock during normal inventory cycles. The Bureau acknowledged that the proposal could result in some disclosures for the same prepaid account product (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> electronic disclosures provided online or printed disclosures provided in person without the use of packaging) having different incidence-based fee disclosures on the short forms provided on retail store packaging material. The Bureau, however, did not believe that this discrepancy would significantly impact a consumer's decision regarding which prepaid account product to acquire since consumers would most likely be comparing the disclosures for two distinct products, and not reviewing disclosures side-by-side for the same prepaid account product found in different acquisition channels.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also recognized that allowing financial institutions to continue to use packaging with out-of-date incidence-based fee disclosure in retail stores could reduce the effectiveness of this disclosure. The Bureau, however, believed that imposing a cut-off date after which sale or distribution of out-of-date retail packages would be prohibited could be overly burdensome.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also proposed to adopt several comments to provide additional guidance on incidence-based fee disclosures. Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">8</em>)-1 would have provided guidance regarding the number of incidence-based fees to disclose in the short form, including when no fees, more than three, or less than three fees meet the criteria in the definition of incidence-based fees. Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">8</em>)-2 would have set forth how to determine which fees were incurred most frequently in the prior 12-month period and would have also clarified that the price for purchasing or activating a prepaid account could qualify as an incidence-based fee. Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">8</em>)(I)-3 would have provided guidance regarding the disclosure of incidence-based fees in accordance with the proposed effective date regime in proposed § 1005.18(h). Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">8</em>)(I)-4 would have explained how to disclose incidence-based fees when disclosing multiple service plans on a short form disclosure that would have been permitted by proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(iii)(B). Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">8</em>)(I)-5 would have explained that proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">8</em>)(I) would have permitted a reprint exception that would not have required that financial institutions immediately destroy existing inventory in retail stores or elsewhere in the distribution channel, to the extent the disclosures on such packaging materials were otherwise accurate, but would have required that, if a financial institution determines that an incidence-based fee listed on a short form disclosure in a retail store no longer qualified as one of the most commonly incurred fees and made the appropriate change when printing new disclosures, any packages in retail stores that contained the previous incidence-based fee disclosure could still be sold in compliance with proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">8</em>)(I).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(8)(II).</em> Recognizing that new prepaid products have no prior fee data history, the Bureau also proposed additional requirements to address such circumstances. Proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">8</em>)(II) would have required that, if a particular prepaid account product was not offered by the financial institution during the prior 12-month period, the financial institution would have to disclose up to three fees other than any of those fees disclosed pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) through (<em data-original="E-03">7</em>) that it reasonably anticipates will be incurred by consumers most frequently during the next 12-month period. The incidence-based fee disclosures for newly-created prepaid account products would have to be included on all disclosures created for the prepaid account product, whether the disclosure is written, electronic, or on the packaging material of a prepaid account product sold in a retail store, in accordance with the timing requirements in proposed § 1005.18(h). Although financial institutions do not have actual fee data for new prepaid account products, the Bureau believed that they nonetheless would have a reasonable expectation as to which fees would be incurred most frequently. Thus, financial institutions would have been required, for those prepaid account products without prior fee data, to estimate in advance the fees that should be disclosed in the incidence-based portion of the short form disclosure. Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">8</em>)(II)-1 would have explained that the financial institution should use available data to reasonably anticipate what fees should be disclosed and provided an example to illustrate.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(8)(III).</em> The Bureau also proposed additional requirements for when a particular prepaid account product's fee schedule changes. Specifically, proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">8</em>)(III) would have required that, if a financial institution changes an existing prepaid account product's fee schedule at any point after assessing its incidence-based fee disclosure for the prior 12-month period pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">8</em>)(I), it would have had to determine whether, after making such changes, it reasonably anticipates that the existing incidence-based fee disclosure would represent the most commonly incurred fees for the remainder of the current 12-month period. If the financial institution reasonably anticipates that the current incidence-based fee disclosure would not have represented the most commonly incurred fees for the remainder of the current 12-month period, it would have had to update the incidence-based fee disclosure within 90 days for disclosures provided in written or electronic form, in accordance with the timing requirements in proposed § 1005.18(h).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">8</em>)(III) also would have required that disclosures provided on a prepaid account product's packaging material, for example, in retail stores pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii), or in other locations, must be revised when the financial institution is printing new packaging material, in accordance with the timing requirements of proposed § 1005.18(h). All disclosures provided pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">8</em>)(III) and created after a financial institution makes an incidence-based fee assessment and determines changes are necessary must include such changes, in accordance with the timing requirements of proposed § 1005.18(h). Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">8</em>)(III)-1 would have provided an example demonstrating the impact of a fee change on an existing prepaid account product's incidence-based fee disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau noted in the proposal that its proposed model forms did not isolate or identify these incidence-based fees in a way that would have distinguished them from the other fees, outside the top-line, disclosed under proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">5</em>) through (<em data-original="E-03">7</em>). Thus, the Bureau explained, a consumer comparing two different prepaid account products may see some types of fees that are the same (the seven standardized fees disclosed pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) through (<em data-original="E-03">7</em>)) and may see some that differ (the three incidence-based fees disclosed pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">8</em>)). During its pre-proposal consumer testing, the Bureau tested language identifying the incidence-based fees as such, but this language was often ignored or misunderstood by participants.<footnote ref="408">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report I at 35.</footnote>
             Nevertheless, the Bureau recognized that some variation on the short form fee disclosure could lead to confusion, and thus the Bureau sought comment on whether the model forms should more clearly indicate to a consumer the meaning of the incidence-based fees.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also recognized that the proposed procedure for determining and disclosing incidence-based fees could be complicated in some instances, particularly for new prepaid accounts or those with revised fee schedules. Further, the Bureau acknowledged that basing the incidence-based fees determination on fee incidence might not make sense for all prepaid products. Thus, the Bureau sought comment on all aspects of this incidence-based fees proposal. Among other things, the Bureau specifically solicited feedback on whether other measures, such as fee revenue, would be better measures of the most important remaining fees to disclose to consumers considering a prepaid account, and whether there should be a de minimis threshold below which changes to the incidence ranking would not require form revisions, and if so, what that threshold should be.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Numerous industry commenters spanning a panoply of interests in the prepaid industry including trade associations, issuing banks, credit unions, program managers, a law firm commenting on behalf of a coalition of prepaid issuers, and other parties involved in the prepaid industry, as well as several employers, addressed the proposed requirement to disclose incidence-based fees, with the vast majority recommending the Bureau eliminate this aspect of the short form disclosure. Their specific concerns and criticisms are discussed in detail below. Industry commenters, however, generally supported the proposed reprint exception. That exception would have excused financial institutions from annually updating the incidence-based fees for disclosures provided on a prepaid account product's packaging material, for example, in retail stores, until the financial institution prints new packaging material.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters offered myriad reasons in support of their recommendation that the Bureau not finalize the requirement to disclose incidence-based fees. Industry commenters' concerns, summarized here, are discussed in more detail in the paragraphs that follow. Some said that the disclosure would heavily burden industry with what they viewed to be little, if any, benefits to consumers and, if finalized as proposed, would likely cause some prepaid providers to exit the market. Many said that this disclosure defeats the uniformity in the short form and thus could inhibit consumers' ability to comparison shop. Many others asserted that the disclosure would create a discrepancy between fees disclosed online and those disclosed on packaging for financial institutions taking advantage of the reprint exception. Some industry commenters suggested that the incidence-based fees disclosed may not be germane to all consumers. Some also asserted the disclosure would be redundant because the incidence-based fees can be found elsewhere, such as on the long form disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Specifically, some industry commenters voiced concern regarding consumer comprehension of the significance of incidence-based fees. They said that the disclosure defeats uniformity within and comparison shopping among short form disclosures because incidence-based fees would vary among different prepaid account programs and over time even for the same program, which they contended would mislead consumers into thinking that absence of a certain fee on the short form may mean the feature is not offered. A few commenters said that because of differences in customer usage, some of the disclosed incidence-based fees would not be germane to some consumers. Some industry commenters contended that the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing showed that consumers did not understand if they would incur incidence-based fees, that frequency of incidence determined disclosure of one feature over another, or how the information was relevant to them in selecting a prepaid account. One industry commenter said that addressing this confusion with an explanation of these topics in the short form disclosure would take up valuable space and create its own confusion, but that eliminating the requirement to disclose incidence-based fees would solve this problem while reducing the overwhelming amount and complexity of the information required in the short form disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters questioned the Bureau's rationale for the disclosure of incidence-based fees in the proposed rule, saying that the risk of fee evasion by industry is unwarranted in the current competitive prepaid marketplace.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters questioned the validity of the data upon which incidence-based fees would be calculated, saying incidence-based fees were unlikely to change significantly absent structural changes to the program and that, because prepaid accounts are typically short-lived, annual assessment would not provide a sufficient basis from which to extrapolate meaningful information.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters, including issuing banks, credit unions, and industry trade associations, asserted that requiring disclosure of incidence-based fees for products distributed in bank branch settings is unnecessary as availability of the long form disclosure prior to acquisition and bank personnel to answer questions both encourage more thoughtful consumer review. Some of these industry commenters claimed incidence-based disclosures would disproportionately burden community banks and credit unions because they use outside vendors to handle disclosures, creating higher costs and unfair due diligence demands on banks to oversee the vendors. Some said that, without an exemption for small issuers, compliance costs may force these providers out of the market. A program manager for government benefit account programs recommended an exemption for accounts arranged for or issued by government agencies, saying agencies usually each offer only one prepaid account program and consequently, consumers do not need disclosures to be provided in a format designed to facilitate comparison of multiple prepaid accounts offered by the agency. Alternatively, the commenter recommended permitting government agencies to aggregate their data for incidence-based fees rather than analyzing each program separately.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters focused on the perceived burden of this proposed requirement, saying the disclosure would be complex, costly, and difficult to implement. One industry commenter said the fear that any changes to incidence-based fees will require changes to packaging and marketing materials would stifle innovation and development of new services or new prepaid products. Another recommended the Bureau commission a study to confirm that the benefits of the incidence-based disclosure outweigh the burden. Many industry commenters said it would be a major undertaking to identify and calculate incidence-based fees, with some saying the proposed annual update alone would necessitate a massive amount of new procedures, controls, system updates, and packaging design changes.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Some questioned the meaning in the proposed rule of the term “separate prepaid account program,” saying initial and ongoing identification and calculation of incidence-based fees would be particularly cost prohibitive for entities with hundreds or thousands of separate prepaid account programs, as they said is the case with certain companies that issue or manage payroll card account programs. Some commenters involved in payroll card account programs queried whether the proposed rule would require them to calculate incidence-based fees for each individual program negotiated separately with an employer or whether they could aggregate data across programs. For example, one payroll card account program manager with 4,000 individual employer programs said every annual printing would cost $1 per cardholder such that annual printing costs alone would be a multimillion dollar undertaking.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters questioned specific aspects of the proposed incidence-based fee disclosure. A few commenters questioned the proposed 90-day period for updates, saying it was unclear whether both assessing and updating incidence-based fees would be required in that time frame and recommended various extensions of the period, for example, to 120 days for both assessment and updating, 12 months after analysis to update, or within a reasonable time after a change. A trade association commenter said the requirement to disclose additional fee types would pose a “compliance trap” because financial institutions could be second-guessed on how they categorized them.<footnote ref="409">While proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;8&lt;/em&gt;)(I) would have required disclosure of up to three &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;fees,&lt;/em&gt; proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;8&lt;/em&gt;)(I)-2 would have explained that, in determining incidence-based fees, financial institutions would have had to total the incidence for each &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;fee type&lt;/em&gt; incurred during the prescribed period.</footnote>
             Another industry commenter said financial institutions would have to justify their categorization and tracking of fees to examiners, even when vendors perform that service (as, they said, is the case with many small banks). Another commenter said the “reasonable” standard for estimating incidence for new products would be complicated and inexact, with no guarantee of accuracy but would function as a de facto strict liability standard.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters responded to the Bureau's solicitation of comments regarding alternatives to the proposed incidence-based fee disclosure. They variously recommended the following in the short form disclosure: A general statement that other fees may apply, disclosing all fees, or adding to the static fees already disclosed on the short form up to three more common fees chosen by the financial institution or determined by the Bureau on the basis of research. Some industry commenters recommended modifying the proposed update schedule by requiring the update every two years, or requiring it only when there is a fee change which would require the financial institution to update the prepaid account terms, packaging, and disclosures in any case.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A few industry commenters addressed the Bureau's queries regarding whether the disclosure should be based on assessment of fee frequency, as proposed, or fee revenue. A trade association and an issuing bank said they had no preference, as long as the criteria are clear, easy to determine, and not subject to annual updating. A program manager also said it had no preference as it has the data necessary for either calculation, and the cost and compliance burden would be the same either way.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The proposal sought comment on a de minimis threshold below which changes to the incidence ranking would not require form revisions. While some industry commenters supported this idea, others went further and advocated for a general de minimis threshold that would not require disclosure of additional fee types below a threshold set by the Bureau. A trade association, a payment network, an issuing bank, and several program managers urged the Bureau to adopt a general de minimis exclusion from the incidence-based fee requirement. The issuing bank said this would help to ensure that consumers are provided with information on the short form disclosure that is most likely to be relevant to their actual use of the prepaid account. Other commenters explained that, in general, very little revenue is generated from fees paid by consumers that are not already reflected on the proposed short form, other than from the purchase price and activation fees (when charged), though there are outliers in certain circumstances. One commenter expressed concern that because so few consumers use the services associated with these other fees, the incidence-based fees required to be disclosed would likely change every year due to small shifts in consumer usage.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A trade association recommended the Bureau adopt a safe harbor to the proposed incidence-based fee requirement that allows financial institutions to disclose all fees on the short form, with a de minimis exception for fees that are imposed on fewer than 25 percent of accounts. A credit union similarly recommended that the Bureau give financial institutions the option of listing all fees on the short form, which it said would be more transparent to consumers and more beneficial particularly for issuers who charge a limited number of fees on their prepaid accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several consumer group commenters, on the other hand, supported the proposed disclosure of incidence-based fees. These commenters said that requiring disclosure of incidence-based fees would prevent financial institutions from designing their fee schedules to minimize fees required to be disclosed on the short form and to maximize those that are only listed on the long form disclosure, where consumers are less likely to see them. They also said the disclosure of incidence-based fees would help consumers evaluate and avoid the most-commonly charged fees.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The consumer group commenters also recommended some changes to the proposed requirement. They all recommended requiring calculation of the fees based on revenue, rather than frequency of incidence, saying it is more important to warn consumers about high fees that impact small numbers of consumers rather than small fees charged often. They warned that placing more importance on a commonly incurred but inexpensive fee, rather than a rare expensive fee, could result in consumers paying more for fees that are not prominently displayed. They said the rule could incent some providers to bring down cost of the most common fees in favor of higher fees on those incurred less often, thus hiding potential costly charges.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One consumer group commenter recommended eliminating the 12-month lookback period for assessment of incidence-based fees because an expensive fee, such as a legal process fee, may be charged sporadically but could devastate a consumer. That commenter also argued against a de minimis exception, saying any fee so small or so rarely incurred should be eliminated. Moreover, it said, a de minimis threshold would likely eliminate disclosure of infrequent but costly fees, such as legal fees for garnishment. The consumer group also suggested requiring standardized use of the term “bill payment” for incidence-based fees. Another consumer group recommended permitting a financial institution that charges a total of four other fees to disclose all four of those fees in lieu of disclosing three of those fees and the statement regarding other fees.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Regarding purchase price, one consumer group commenter agreed that, as the Bureau had proposed, the purchase price for a prepaid account should be a potential incidence-based fee and not be required as a static fee because of the limited space in the short form and other parts of the packaging can disclose this information. Moreover, the commenter said, it is a one-time fee and consumers will take notice of the price they have to pay for the prepaid account. On the other hand, another consumer group commenter recommended that the purchase price be required to be disclosed as a static fee on the short form or, alternatively, as an incidence-based fee. It said disclosure of this fee was important because almost half of regular GPR card users buy a new card when their funds are exhausted, so the purchase price is a frequent expense. Further, it stated that simply because the purchase price is deducted from the amount of cash loaded onto a prepaid card does not mean that consumers understand this fee.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">8</em>), renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix), with substantial modifications, largely in response to comments received. First, as discussed above, the Bureau is moving the disclosure's location on the short form so that it appears immediately after the statement regarding the number of additional fee types charged pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A). The Bureau believes that locating these disclosures together will help consumers see their connection and increase understanding of why the fee information specified under final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) may vary among prepaid account programs, and thus enhance the use of short form disclosures for comparison shopping. The Bureau believes this will also make the disclosure of the total number of additional fee types under final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii) more valuable to consumers by providing some additional specific information.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Second, the Bureau is finalizing several changes to the nature of the disclosure. In particular, the Bureau is requiring disclosure of two fee types <footnote ref="410">See comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-2 for an explanation of the term “fee type” and a list of examples of fee types and fee variations within those fee types that a financial institution may use when determining both the number of additional fee types pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) and any additional fee types to disclose pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). Final comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-4 also clarifies that a financial institution must use the same categorization of fee types in the number of additional fee types disclosed pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii) and in its determination of which additional fee types to disclose pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix).</footnote>
             instead of three, and has renamed this requirement the “disclosure of additional fee types.” In addition, the Bureau is requiring that the criteria for determining fee types be based on which categories generate the highest revenue from consumers, rather than highest incidence of consumer use as proposed. As discussed above, the Bureau compiled a list of fee type examples to provide guidance to financial institutions and to help facilitate their categorization of additional fee types for satisfying the requirements in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) and (ix).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Third, the Bureau has made a number of other adjustments intended to reduce compliance burden relative to the proposal regarding the tracking and reporting of the additional fee types. These adjustments are in addition to proposed burden-reducing measures that the Bureau is adopting in the final rule, such as the exemption from having to update the listing of additional fee types on previously printed packaging materials, pursuant to the update printing exception in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">4</em>). Additional burden-reducing measures in the final rule include a 24-month (rather than annual) cycle for assessing and updating the disclosures and permitting financial institutions to track revenue on a consolidated basis across multiple prepaid account programs that share the same fee schedule. The final rule also permits issuers not to provide disclosures for any fee categories that fall below 5 percent of consumer-generated revenues, as well as excluding certain other fee categories. Finally, the Bureau has replaced the proposed commentary with a number of new comments to provide additional clarification and guidance on the requirements set forth in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has considered the industry comments objecting to the proposed disclosure of incidence-based fees <footnote ref="411">Hereinafter, the Bureau uses the final rule term “additional fee types” in place of “incidence-based fees,” unless the discussion calls for specific reference to the term from the proposed rule.</footnote>
             and recommending their elimination from the final rule. It has also considered the alternatives recommended by some industry commenters and suggestions for improvement by consumer group commenters. The Bureau has made extensive refinements to the proposed framework based in substantial part on this feedback but continues to believe that there is value to maintaining a dynamic element on the short form and that disclosing specific additional fee information that is updated on a periodic basis is the best way to provide such dynamic information, as discussed further below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in detail in the next few paragraphs, the Bureau continues to believe it is important that financial institutions disclose to consumers certain fee types not otherwise listed on the short form. The Bureau believes that this may be particularly important for certain virtual wallets and other products covered by this final rule that may have pricing structures that do not mirror those of GPR cards or other more traditional prepaid products, as well as for capturing potential major evolutions in pricing structures on traditional products that may occur in the future. Further, the final rule provides some flexibility to financial institutions that have fewer than two fee types required to be disclosed pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(B) to disclose additional fee types of their choice, such as those particular to their prepaid account program and imposed for features that could be appealing to consumers. It also provides additional flexibility for financial institutions to disclose the names and fee amounts of the discrete fee variations for additional fee types with two or fewer fee variations pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(C).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>First, as pointed out by some consumer group commenters, the requirement to disclose additional fee types in the short form disclosure creates a dynamic disclosure designed to reduce incentives for manipulating fee structures to reduce the cost of the most common fee types in favor of higher fees on fee types incurred less often, thus hiding potential costly charges. The Bureau is not convinced, as asserted by some industry commenters, that market forces alone would adequately control for potential fee manipulation. Requiring disclosure of additional fee types in the short form will help prevent financial institutions from minimizing the cost of the fees required to be disclosed in and outside the short form by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (vii) and (5) in favor of higher fees for fee types that would only be required to be disclosed in the comprehensive long form disclosure, where the Bureau believes consumers are much less likely to see them before acquiring a prepaid account. In particular for prepaid accounts sold at retail, consumers may not see the additional fee types disclosed only in the long form and, thus, could be more likely to incur such fees unknowingly. Putting consumers on notice of additional fee types that, outside of those excluded from disclosure pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) through (<em data-original="E-03">3</em>), generate the highest revenue from consumers for the particular prepaid account or across prepaid account programs that share the same fee schedule will alert consumers to account features for which they may end up incurring a significant cost.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Second, eschewing full standardization in a static short form disclosure in favor of the dynamic disclosure of additional fee types enables the disclosure to capture market changes and innovations. In this way, the short form is capable of reflecting over time significant changes in consumer use patterns that affect the amount of revenue generated for new features. Disclosing additional fee types in the short form allows the disclosure to reflect the advent of new fee types that consumers may come to incur frequently and for significant cost that, without this requirement, otherwise would be prohibited from disclosure in the short form and thus could render it outdated and of diminished value to consumers over time. This same dynamism also permits disclosure of fees for certain types of prepaid accounts, such as mobile wallets, whose currently scant fee structures may not otherwise be represented in the short form. Further, requiring disclosure of additional fee types allows the short form to capture future fee types charged by new products and under new pricing models that emerge over time. Without this mechanism, the information provided to consumers in the short form disclosure may become ossified and anachronistic over time absent additional rulemakings by the Bureau to update the required elements of the short form.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau recognizes that there are some tradeoffs for consumers and for industry in providing the disclosures, but believes those disadvantages are outweighed by the benefits of these disclosures to consumers. Moreover, the Bureau believes that the changes it has made in the final rule address many of the concerns raised by industry commenters and also substantially reduce the burden on financial institutions related to providing these disclosures relative to the proposal.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One objection raised by industry commenters is that, because the additional fee types disclosures will be the only non-standardized elements of the short form, the lack of uniformity will cause consumer confusion and prevent comparison shopping. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii) above, the Bureau had consumer tested language to explain how the incidence-based fees were selected for disclosure on the short form but found that the information did not track well with consumers. The Bureau believes that the final rule substantially reduces this problem by linking the disclosures in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii) and (ix) by using a transition statement between the two (“Here are some of them:”) as discussed above, making clear that the specific additional fee types listed are examples of additional types of fees not otherwise disclosed on the short form. While the short form will not specifically explain why those two particular fee types were selected for disclosure, consumers will be able to understand that this portion of the form is variable across prepaid account programs, evaluate the specific information provided for potential applicability to their expected prepaid account use, and seek more information. The Bureau does not believe it necessary for consumers to understand the calculations behind and the specific purpose of the additional fee types to benefit from their disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Some commenters said the proposed reprint exemption would create discrepancies among short form disclosures for the same prepaid account program depending on where a consumer views the form (for example, at retail versus online). However, in addition to the modifications to the final rule discussed above adding an explanatory heading above the listing of additional fee types, the Bureau believes it unlikely most consumers will be comparing short form disclosures for the same prepaid account program in different mediums. Moreover, a large majority of industry commenters favored the reprint exemption, as it reduces burden, and the Bureau believes it is preferable to retain this exemption in the final rule as opposed to removing it. The Bureau does not believe that the additional fee type disclosures required by the final rule will stifle innovation, as suggested by industry commenters, particularly given the reprint exemption and the additional explanation the Bureau has provided in the supplementary information for this final rule regarding use of change-in-terms notices pursuant to § 1005.8(a) and notice of new EFT services pursuant to § 1005.7(c). See, <em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<em data-original="E-03">4</em>) below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With regard to comparison shopping, the Bureau believes that having the same disclosures in the bulk of the short form, including the static fees and informational statements, will create more than sufficient consistency to facilitate consumer comparison shopping based on key fees in the marketplace, despite some variance introduced by the disclosure of two additional fee types. At the same time, the disclosure of additional fee types will ensure that consumers are made aware of significant fee types relating to each particular prepaid account program. Also, the transition statement linking the statement regarding the number of additional fee types and the disclosure of additional fee types provides sufficient information to orient consumers to these disclosures and will help dispel the consumer confusion that concerned industry commenters, particularly in light of consumer testing of explanations of the criteria for selection of additional fee types that proved ineffective.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>To preserve standardization and consistency across short form disclosures, the Bureau declines to exempt prepaid accounts distributed in branches, particularly those of community banks and credit unions, and by government agencies from the requirement to disclose additional fee types. In addition to preserving standardization across short form disclosures, the Bureau is concerned that creating an individualized disclosure regime for different acquisition settings would create a patchwork regulatory regime, which is what this rule seeks to eliminate. The Bureau believes it is important to make the short form disclosure as informative as possible considering its space constraints; the disclosures regarding additional fee types will encourage consumers to review the long form for more detailed information in a way that simply providing the long form disclosure will not do.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In finalizing this provision, the Bureau attempted to maximize the usefulness of the disclosure for consumers while exacting the minimum burden on industry. As discussed above and below, the final rule incorporates many burden-reducing measures relative to the proposal, such as excluding certain fees from potential disclosure as additional fee types altogether (final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) and (<em data-original="E-03">3</em>)), allowing for a consolidated calculation of additional fee types to occur across all prepaid account programs that share the same fee schedule (final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)), increasing the timeframe for data collection and assessment/update from one year to 24 months (final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D) and (E)), and incorporating a de minimis revenue threshold to exclude from potential disclosure fee types that fall below this threshold (final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>)). The Bureau is skeptical that this disclosure requirement will prompt financial institutions to exit the prepaid market as suggested by some commenters. Rather, the Bureau believes that the burden imposed on financial institutions by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) is manageable. Also, with regard to comments that the disclosure of additional fee types in the short form is redundant of information found in the long form disclosure, the Bureau believes these fees merit disclosure in the short form as it is the disclosure most likely to be reviewed pre-acquisition by consumers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Each aspect of final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) is addressed in turn below, together with other specific comments from both industry and consumer groups.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>1005.33(a)(1) Types of Transfers or Inquiries Covered</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(B) provides that a delay is not an “error” if it is related to the remittance transfer provider's fraud screening procedures or in accordance with the Bank Secrecy Act, 31 U.S.C. 5311, et seq., Office of Foreign Assets Control requirements, or similar laws or requirements. Section 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(B). In the April Proposal, the Bureau explained that it did not intend for this provision to apply to delays related to routine fraud screening procedures; accordingly, the Bureau proposed to revise § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(B) to apply only to delays related to individualized investigation or other special action. To provide additional guidance, the Bureau proposed a new comment 33(a)-7, which would have explained that a delay is not an error where it is caused by an investigation or other special action necessary to address potentially suspicious, blocked, or prohibited activity.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The proposed comment included two examples of the types of delays that would not constitute an error under proposed § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(B), namely, a delay that occurs after a screening process flags a designated recipient's name as a potentially blocked individual, and a delay that occurs because the transfer is flagged as being similar to previous fraudulent activity. The proposed comment contrasted these two examples with delays caused by “ordinary fraud or other screening procedures, where no potentially fraudulent, suspicious, blocked or prohibited activity is identified,” which would not have qualified for the exception.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau sought comment on whether the proposed change to the regulatory text and related examples and description in the commentary accurately reflected industry practice and/or provided sufficient guidance on the types of permissible delays. The single consumer group that commented on this issue expressed its support for the proposed changes. Some industry commenters, including a large bank and a community bank, generally expressed support for the Bureau's effort to provide further clarity on the types of delays that qualify for the error exception, opining that the revisions suggested would cover the majority of relevant, screening-related delays.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The majority of commenters who addressed the issue, however, opposed the Bureau's proposed changes, for a variety of different reasons. Commenters, including State and national trade associations, credit unions, small and large banks, and a bank holding company, generally expressed concern that the revised language would discourage important fraud, terrorism, and anti-money laundering screenings by exposing providers that regularly conduct such screenings to liability under Regulation E. Other commenters, including a large money transmitter and a number of State credit union trade associations, argued that there is a false dichotomy between procedures that are “necessary” or “special” and those that are “ordinary.” They noted that enhanced screening procedures are a standard, routine part of most remittance transfer providers' “ordinary” business, and that whether or not such procedures are “necessary” cannot always be determined at the outset of an investigation.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>A similar concern was expressed by a large money transmitter commenter. Among other concerns, it argued that the two examples proposed by the Bureau in proposed comment 33(a)-7 were too narrow, and the commenter opposed the use of the term “individualized” to characterize the types of procedures that would qualify for the exception under revised § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(B). According to this commenter's description of its standard fraud screening procedures, the Bureau's choice of examples and terminology did not adequately capture screening procedures that apply to certain categories of transfers—known as “block screenings”—rather than only to a particular transfer. For example, the commenter explained that remittance transfer providers sometimes receive real-time information from law enforcement that transfers going to a certain geographic area (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> a particular country or part of a country) could have a high percentage likelihood of being related to a criminal operation. When the provider receives such information, it may temporarily delay all transfers that fit the characteristics identified by law enforcement. According to the commenter, under the proposed language, it would be unclear whether when such “block screenings” resulted in a delay, the commenter could would be able to rely on the § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(B) exception.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is mindful that commenters are wary of any requirement that they view as creating potential liability for what they deem to be standard operational procedures. The Bureau believes, however, that the commenters have largely based their concerns on an inaccurate and overly narrow interpretation of the proposed revisions. The Bureau's proposal was related to disclosure; it did not dictate to remittance transfer providers the type of screening procedures they could adopt. The proposal would simply have required that, where a provider ordinarily applies a certain type of procedure in connection with a certain type of transfer, the provider account for any additional length of time associated with that screening into its disclosure of the estimated date of availability. This requirement would have applied whether the additional time was 30 minutes or five days—in other words, if the provider knew that a procedure would apply to a particular remittance transfer and would delay that remittance transfer for a period of time (whether it be 30 minutes or five days), the provider would have been required to adjust the disclosed date of availability accordingly.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Nonetheless, the Bureau understands that its attempt in proposed comment 33(a)-7 to draw a distinction between “ordinary” and “necessary” investigations could be construed as not accurately or completely capturing the types of procedures that the Bureau believes could qualify as an exception under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(B). Accordingly, the Bureau is finalizing comment 33(a)-7 with a modification to clarify whether the remittance transfer provider could have reasonably foreseen the delay at the time the provider provided the date of availability disclosure. Specifically, comment 33(a)-7 now explains that a delay does not constitute an error, if such delay is related to the provider's or any third party's investigation necessary to address potentially suspicious, blocked or prohibited activity, and the provider did not, and could not have reasonably foreseen the delay so as to enable it to timely disclose an accurate date of availability when providing the sender with a receipt or combined disclosure. In addition, the Bureau is adding two additional examples to comment 33(a)-7 to illustrate the application of the revised language. The first example clarifies that there is no error where a provider delays a remittance transfer in order to investigate specific law enforcement information indicating that a remittance transfer may match a pattern of fraudulent activity if it was not reasonable to disclose that delay when the provider disclosed the date of availability. The second example states that, if a provider knows in time to make a timely disclosure that all remittance transfers to a certain area undergo a two-day long screening procedure, the provider must include an additional two days in its disclosure of the date of availability.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that these examples do not represent the only situations that could satisfy this exception. The unique nature of the screenings at issue and the variety of business practices and technical capabilities among remittance transfer providers do not allow the Bureau to address every possible scenario. Furthermore, the Bureau emphasizes that nothing in the changes adopted herein should be construed as limiting a provider's ability to perform necessary screenings. Instead, the Bureau intends the revision to clarify that providers cannot avoid liability for an error in situations where they could have reasonably foreseen the delay so as to enable them to timely disclose an accurate date of availability but failed to disclose that date to the sender. Whether a provider could have reasonably foreseen a delay in time to make changes to its disclosure depends on the facts and circumstances surrounding the transfer. The Bureau believes that its approach in the final rule, as opposed to the April Proposal, responds to commenters' concerns that the proposed language was perhaps too narrow and did not allow for flexibility arising out of the varied nature of fraud and other screenings.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, as proposed, the Bureau is renumbering existing comments 33(a)-7 through -10 as comments 33(a)-8 through -11, respectively, to reflect the insertion of new comment 33(a)-7.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>15(c) Pre-Acquisition Disclosure Requirements</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed new disclosure requirements for government benefit accounts that would be provided before a consumer acquired a government benefit account. The requirements in proposed § 1005.15(c) would have been in addition to the initial disclosure requirements in existing § 1005.7(b) and corresponded to the requirements in proposed § 1005.18(b) for prepaid accounts generally.<footnote ref="342">The Bureau also proposed, for purposes of government benefit accounts, to expand the requirement in existing § 1005.7(b)(5) to disclose fees related to EFTs to cover all fees related to the government benefit account, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.15(f)(1) below. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See also&lt;/em&gt; § 1005.18(f)(1) (finalizing the same requirement for prepaid accounts).</footnote>
             EFTA section 905(a) sets forth disclosure requirements for accounts subject to the Act.<footnote ref="343">Specifically, EFTA section 905(a) states that “[t]he terms and conditions of electronic fund transfers involving a consumer's account shall be disclosed at the time the consumer contracts for an electronic fund transfer service, in accordance with regulations of the Bureau.” 15 U.S.C. 1693c(a).</footnote>
             In addition to these disclosures, the Bureau proposed to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c), and 905(a), and section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act to require government agencies to provide disclosures prior to the time a consumer acquires a government benefit account. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(1)(i) below for prepaid accounts, the Bureau believed that adjustment of the timing requirement was necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of government benefit account consumers, because the proposed revision would have assisted consumers' understanding of the terms and conditions of their government benefit accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed new § 1005.15(c) to extend to government benefit accounts the same pre-acquisition disclosure requirements the Bureau proposed for prepaid accounts, as discussed in detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b) below. Specifically, proposed § 1005.15(c)(1) would have stated that before a consumer acquired a government benefit account, a government agency must comply with the pre-acquisition disclosure requirements applicable to prepaid accounts as set forth in proposed § 1005.18(b), in accordance with the timing requirements of proposed § 1005.18(h).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>To address issues of compulsory use (<em data-original="E-03">see</em> existing § 1005.10(e)(2) and new comment 10(e)(2)-2)), the Bureau proposed that a notice be provided at the top of the short form disclosure to highlight for consumers that they were not required to accept the government benefit account. As it noted in the proposal, the Bureau believed it was important for consumers to realize they had the option of not accepting a government benefit account before they acquired the account, and that receiving such notice at the top of the short form would help to ensure consumers were aware of this right. To that end, proposed § 1005.15(c)(2) would have stated that before a consumer acquired a government benefit account, the agency must provide a statement pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(A) that the consumer did not have to accept the government benefit account and that the consumer could ask about other ways to get their benefit payments from the agency instead of receiving them through the account, in a form substantially similar to proposed Model Form A-10(a).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 15(c)-1 would have explained that proposed Model Form A-10(a) contained a model form for the pre-acquisition short form disclosure requirements for government benefit accounts pursuant to proposed § 1005.15(c), and that government agencies could use Sample Form A-10(e) to comply with the pre-acquisition long form disclosure requirements of proposed § 1005.15(c)(1). Proposed comment 15(c)-2 would have reiterated that proposed § 1005.18(b)(1)(i) generally required delivery of both the short form and long form disclosures before a consumer acquired a prepaid account, and provided, in comment 15(c)-2.i, an example illustrating when a consumer received disclosures before acquisition of an account for purposes of proposed § 1005.15(c)(1). Proposed comment 15(c)-3 would have explained that the disclosures and notice required by proposed § 1005.15(c)(1) and (2) could be given in the same process or appointment during which the consumer acquired or agreed to acquire a government benefit account. When a consumer received benefits eligibility information and signed up or enrolled to receive benefits during the same process or appointment, a government agency that gave the disclosures and notice required by proposed § 1005.15(c)(1) and (2) before issuing a government benefit account would have complied with the timing requirements of proposed § 1005.15(c).</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Several industry and government commenters objected to the wholesale application of the proposed pre-acquisition disclosures to government benefit accounts. Specifically, several trade associations, a program manager for government benefit accounts, and two State government agencies urged the Bureau to exempt government benefit accounts from the proposed disclosure regime altogether, or to exempt them from the requirement to provide the short form disclosure. These commenters argued that the timing requirements proposed by the Bureau were too difficult to implement and unnecessary, since consumers could not in fact shop for alternative government benefit cards. One State government agency commenter argued that the application of the proposal to its program could necessitate revisions to its vendor contracts. In addition, commenters argued that most of the information that would be required by the proposed disclosures is already disclosed to consumers of government benefit accounts in the initial disclosures required by existing § 1005.7(b)(5) or would be disclosed via the proposed long form disclosure. Receiving duplicative information in the short form and long form disclosures, these commenters asserted, would lead to consumer confusion and information overload.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Other industry and government commenters did not object to the general application of the pre-acquisition disclosure requirements to government benefit accounts, but urged the Bureau to modify the requirements to better suit the government benefit account context. For example, several industry trade associations, a law firm writing on behalf of a coalition of prepaid issuers, a program manager for government benefit card programs, and State government agencies argued that consumers would be confused if they saw certain fees listed on the government benefit account disclosures that did not in fact apply to their government benefit account program. These commenters urged the Bureau to allow agencies and financial institutions to omit such fees rather than disclose them with a corresponding “N/A” or “$0,” as required under proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) and comment 18(b)(2)(i)-1. Likewise, certain commenters objected to the proposed requirement that the disclosures for government benefit account programs disclose the maximum amount that could be charged for each fee, since such a disclosure would in some cases misinform consumers as to the actual fee charged in connection with their account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The program manager commenter and a State government agency commenter argued that government benefit accounts should be exempt from the proposed incidence-based fee disclosure requirements. They argued that the calculation required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">8</em>) would be too difficult to complete for government benefit accounts, especially since it was unclear whether the calculation must include every distinct program the issuer offers (of which there could be dozens), or only different types of programs. Oftentimes, the commenters noted, issuers offer only one type of program, but that program is customized for individual government agency clients. The commenters argued in addition that government benefit accounts should be exempted from the segregation requirement in proposed § 1005.18(b)(4), so that the short form disclosure accompanying them can include additional information about how consumers can use their accounts with minimal fee charges.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A large number of commenters, including payment networks, issuing banks, program managers, industry trade associations, a member of Congress, and several government agencies, urged the Bureau to revise the language of the notice requirement in proposed § 1005.15(c)(2) to inform a consumer that he or she was not required to accept the government benefit account. They argued that the proposed language was overly negative in tone and would dissuade consumers from choosing prepaid accounts by giving them the impression that prepaid products were unsafe or less preferable than other payment options. A program manager for government benefit accounts and a State government agency also urged the Bureau to remove the requirement that the banner notice for government benefit accounts include a sentence encouraging consumers to “ask about other ways to get” their payments. These commenters argued that this language would lead consumers to contact the government agency or their individual caseworkers to get information about the prepaid account program. Such outreach by consumers would place a further burden on already strained resources without aiding consumers, since agencies or caseworkers were unlikely to have the information the consumer is seeking. Consumer group commenters also asked the Bureau to revise the notice language to include information about what alternative payment methods the consumer could choose, arguing that the onus should not be on the consumer to seek out information about what other payment options are available.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also received numerous comments, from both industry and consumer groups, regarding the timing requirements of the pre-acquisition disclosures and their application in the government benefit context. As stated above, the Bureau proposed comments 15(c)-2 and -3 to clarify when a consumer enrolling to receive government benefits via a prepaid account received the disclosures in compliance with the timing requirements of § 1005.18(b)(1)(i). An industry trade association, two issuing banks, a program manager for government benefit accounts, and a State government agency, argued that the proposed comments did not provide sufficient clarity. Specifically, they were concerned that proposed comment 15(c)-2.i suggested that “acquisition” in the government benefit context meant the consumer's physical acquisition of the card. According to these commenters, entities charged with administering government benefit account programs often distribute inactive government benefit cards to consumers at the same time as they distribute accompanying disclosures and other paperwork. The commenters were concerned that, as proposed, the commentary would disrupt current practices and place additional implementation burdens on government agencies. Further, they argued that the practice of providing consumers with an inactive card does not harm consumers, since consumers do not accrue any fees or undertake any obligations until the card is activated. Instead, the industry and government commenters urged the Bureau to clarify in revised commentary that acquisition for purposes of government benefit accounts was the point at which the consumer agreed or elected to be paid via a government benefit card. One trade association argued instead that the Bureau should define acquisition in this context as the point at which the consumer activates the government benefit account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several consumer group commenters agreed that the Bureau should provide greater clarity regarding what it meant to “acquire” a government benefit account, but argued that the point of acquisition should be defined as earlier in the enrollment process. Two consumer groups specified further that the disclosures should be provided before the consumer acquired the physical (if un-activated) card.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, an industry trade association and an issuing bank argued that the Bureau should exempt government benefit accounts from the requirement in proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">12</em>) that the short form disclosure include a statement communicating to the consumer that a prepaid account must register with a financial institution or service provider in order for the funds loaded onto it to be protected. As stated in the proposal, the Bureau believed this disclosure was necessary because many consumer protections set forth in the proposal would not have taken effect until the consumer registered the account. The Bureau acknowledged, however, that the disclosure would be less useful for government benefit account recipients, since consumers have to register with the agency in any event in order to receive their benefits. Commenters noted in addition that the notice was not necessary for government benefit accounts because, as discussed in greater detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(e)(3) below, government agencies are required to provide error resolution and limited liability protections to government benefit account consumers regardless of whether those consumers have registered their accounts.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is finalizing the general requirement in § 1005.15(c) that government agencies comply with the pre-acquisition disclosure requirements in final § 1005.18(b), with a number of revisions, as explained below. The Bureau is finalizing this provision pursuant to its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c), and 905(a), and section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Bureau believes that extending the disclosure requirements in § 1005.18(b) is necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of government benefit account consumers, by assisting consumers' understanding of the terms and conditions of their government benefit accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Largely similar to proposed § 1005.15(c), final § 1005.15(c)(1) states that before a consumer acquires a government benefit account, a government agency shall comply with the pre-acquisition disclosure requirements applicable to prepaid accounts as set forth in § 1005.18(b). As discussed in more detail below, the Bureau is adopting new § 1005.15(c)(2)(i) and (ii), which largely mirror final § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(xiv)(A) and (B). Section 1005.15(c)(2)(i) reflects several changes to the proposed requirement to inform consumers that they are not required to accept the government benefit account, while § 1005.15(c)(2)(ii) provides that agencies may include additional information about how consumers can access their government benefit account funds or balance information for free or for a reduced fee. The Bureau is also adopting new § 1005.15(c)(3) to address the form of the pre-acquisition disclosures required for government benefit accounts pursuant to final § 1005.15(c). Second, the Bureau is not finalizing proposed comment 15(c)-1; accordingly, it has renumbered proposed comments 15(c)-2 and -3 as final comments 15(c)-1 and -2, respectively. Third, the Bureau is adopting new comment 15(c)-3. Finally, the Bureau is finalizing certain revisions to those comments to provide further guidance on when a consumer acquires a government benefit account for purposes of the pre-acquisition disclosure requirements.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Although the Bureau understands that government benefit accounts are distinguishable from other prepaid accounts in several material respects, including the way they are distributed and marketed and the fees associated with them, the Bureau declines to exempt government benefit accounts from the general requirement to provide both a short form and long form disclosure before the consumer acquires the account. The Bureau notes that, pursuant to final § 1005.18(h) and as discussed in the section-by-section analysis thereof, agencies are not required to pull and replace prepaid account packaging materials with non-compliant disclosures that were produced in the normal course of business prior to October 1, 2017.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau continues to believe that consumers who use these accounts will benefit from the ability to review a set of uniform disclosures regarding their accounts. First, the disclosures provide a clear and conspicuous disclosure of consumers' right under § 1005.10(e)(2) to receive their payment in some other form. The Bureau believes that this important disclosure may be less conspicuous, and therefore potentially less effective, if it were disclosed on the long form disclosure, since the long form disclosure contains far more information in a format that is less hierarchical than the short form disclosure. Second, the new disclosures highlight information that, according to the Bureau's consumer testing, was the most important information consumers needed to inform their decision-making with respect to their preferred payment method.<footnote ref="344">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report I at 7.</footnote>
             Third, although consumers may not be able to shop for alternative government benefit cards, the short form disclosure facilitates comparison shopping between the government benefit card and, for example, the consumer's own prepaid card or a prepaid card sold at retail. With respect to the comments that the pre-acquisition timing requirements would be particularly difficult to implement in the government benefit context, the Bureau notes that the revisions it is making to proposed comment 15(c)-2 (re-numbered as comment 15(c)-1) in the final rule, as discussed below, will provide government agencies and financial institutions with more flexibility to design efficient and practical enrollment procedures that comply with § 1005.15(c).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau likewise disagrees with industry commenters' suggestion that the statement regarding benefit payment options is negative and implies that government benefit accounts are inferior products, thereby discouraging consumers from using them. As discussed in greater detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv) below, the Bureau examined this issue in its post-proposal consumer testing and found that participants did not construe the language negatively, confirming the Bureau's original understanding from the proposal.<footnote ref="345">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report II at 16-17 and 27.</footnote>
             Nonetheless, the Bureau has decided to include in the final rule an alternative version of the statement language which the Bureau believes would address commenters' concerns. Moreover, unlike the proposed statement, this added alternative has the advantage of providing concrete options to consumers regarding other ways to receive their funds. The Bureau is thus finalizing § 1005.15(c)(2)(i), which mirrors final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(A), and provides that as part of its short form pre-acquisition disclosures, the agency must provide a statement that the consumer does not have to accept the government benefit account and directing the consumer to ask about other ways to receive their benefit payments from the agency instead of receiving them via the account, using the following clause or a substantially similar clause: “You do not have to accept this benefits card. Ask about other ways to receive your benefits.” Alternatively, an agency may provide a statement that the consumer has several options to receive benefit payments, followed by a list of the options available to the consumer, and directing the consumer to indicate which option the consumer chooses using the following clause or a substantially similar clause: “You have several options to receive your payments: [list of options available to the consumer]; or this benefits card. Tell the benefits office which option you choose.” Final § 1005.15(c)(2)(i) also provides that this statement must be located above the information required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (iv). This statement must appear in a minimum type size of eight points (or 11 pixels) and appear in no larger a type size than what is used for the fee headings required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (iv).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>To address comments arguing that agencies should be permitted to include additional information on the short form disclosure for government benefit accounts about how consumers can use their accounts with minimal fee charges, the Bureau is adopting new § 1005.15(c)(2)(ii), which states that an agency may, but is not required to, include a statement in one additional line of text in the short form disclosure directing the consumer to a particular location outside the short form disclosure for information on ways the consumer may access government benefit account funds and balance information for free or for a reduced fee. This statement must be located directly below any statements disclosed pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(3)(i) and (ii), or, if no such statements are disclosed, above the statement required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(x). This statement must appear in the same type size used to disclose variable fee information pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(3)(i) and (ii), or, if none, the same type size used for the information required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(x) through (xiii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>To provide greater clarity and additional guidance on the specific form and formatting requirements that must apply to government benefit account disclosures, the Bureau is moving the reference to Model Form A-10(a) to new § 1005.15(c)(3). New § 1005.15(c)(3) mirrors several form and formatting requirements in final § 1005.18(b). Specifically, it states that when a short form disclosure required by final § 1005.15(c) is provided in writing or electronically, the information required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (ix) shall be provided in the form of a table. Except as provided in final § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B), the short form disclosure required by final § 1005.18(b)(2) shall be provided in a form substantially similar to final Model Form A-10(a). Final Sample Form A-10(f) provides an example of the long form disclosure required by final § 1005.18(b)(4) when the agency does not offer multiple service plans.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Because the Bureau has added format requirements for government benefit account disclosures in new § 1005.15(c)(3), proposed comment 15(c)-1 is now superfluous; accordingly, the Bureau is not finalizing that comment. The Bureau has therefore renumbered proposed comments 15(c)-2 and -3 as final comments 15(c)-1 and -2, respectively.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to comments regarding the timing of acquisition requirements in § 1005.15(c), the Bureau agrees that the final rule should provide greater clarity with respect to when a consumer acquires a government benefit account. The Bureau believes that, in providing such clarity, the rule should strike a balance between avoiding significant disruption of current benefit enrollment practices and ensuring that consumers receive the new disclosures early enough in the enrollment process to inform their decision of how to receive their payments, thereby furthering the goals of the compulsory use provision in § 1005.10(e)(2). Accordingly, the Bureau declines to define acquisition as, for example, the point at which the consumer obtains physical possession of a government benefit card, or the point at which a consumer signs an enrollment form, because such a rule could be overly prescriptive and could disrupt current practices and delay benefit disbursement. On the other hand, the Bureau also declines to define acquisition as the point at which a consumer receives his or her first payment on the government benefit card, because it believes that by the time a consumer receives funds via a particular payment method, he or she is less likely to consider alternative options for how to get paid, thereby reducing the value of the pre-acquisition disclosures. Furthermore, the Bureau notes that, pursuant to the compulsory use prohibition in § 1005.10(e)(2), discussed above, consumers cannot be required to receive government benefits by direct deposit to any particular institutions, including a specific prepaid account. In other words, consumers who have the option to receive their government benefits via a government benefit account must be provided with at least one alternative payment method. The Bureau believes that, particularly in such scenarios, the proposed disclosures should be provided in time to help a consumer decide between the alternative payment methods available to him or her.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, and in consideration of the comments above, the Bureau is finalizing revisions to proposed comments 15(c)-2 and -3 (re-numbered as comments 15(c)-1 and -2, respectively) to clarify that a consumer acquires a government benefit account when he or she <em data-original="E-03">chooses</em> to receive benefits via the government benefit account. Specifically, final comment 15(c)-1 has been revised to state that, for purposes of final § 1005.15(c), a consumer is deemed to have received the disclosures required by § 1005.18(b) prior to acquisition when the consumer receives the disclosures before choosing to receive benefits via the government benefit account. The Bureau recognizes that consumers may indicate their choice to be paid via a government benefit card in various ways, including, for example, by signing or filling out an enrollment form or by calling the financial institution to activate the card. The final rule does not specify what actions manifest a consumer's choice regarding how to get paid.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is finalizing the first example in comment 15(c)-1.i generally as proposed. The second example in final comment 15(c)-1.i (which as proposed would have stated that the short form and long form disclosures are provided post-acquisition if a consumer receives them after receiving the government benefit card) has been revised to state that if the consumer does not receive the disclosures required by final § 1005.18(b) to review until the time at which the consumer received the first benefit payment deposited into the government benefit account, these disclosures were provided to the consumer post-acquisition, and were not provided in compliance with final § 1005.15(c). Under the final rule, therefore, a government agency can provide the short form and long form disclosures in the same package as the physical prepaid card and still comply with the requirement in final § 1005.15(c) that the forms be provided prior to acquisition. Likewise, a government agency can provide the pre-acquisition disclosures at the same appointment during which the consumer acquires the government benefit account so long as the disclosures are provided before the consumer actually chooses to receive payments via the account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Final comment 15(c)-2 also reflects certain other technical revisions for clarity and consistency with the above changes. Specifically, this comment states that the disclosures and notice required by final § 1005.15(c) may be given in the same process or appointment during which the consumer receives a government benefit card. When a consumer receives benefits eligibility information and enrolls to receive benefits during the same process or appointment, a government agency that gives the disclosures and notice required by final § 1005.15(c) before the consumer chooses to receive the first benefit payment on the card complies with the timing requirements of final § 1005.15(c).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has added new comment 15(c)-3 to provide clarification regarding the form and formatting requirements for government benefit account disclosures. This comment explains that the requirements in § 1005.15(c) correspond to those for payroll card accounts set forth in § 1005.18(b). The comment also cross-references final comments 18(b)(2)(xiv)(A)-1 and 18(b)(2)(xiv)(B)-1 for additional guidance regarding the requirements set forth in final § 1005.15(c)(2)(i) and (ii), respectively. The Bureau has also added new comment 15(c)-4 to clarify the application of the requirement in § 1005.18(b)(5) that the name of the financial institution be disclosed outside the short form disclosure for government benefit accounts. Pursuant to new comment 15(c)-4, the financial institution whose name must be disclosed pursuant to the requirement in § 1005.18(b)(5) is the financial institution that directly holds the account or issues the account's access device. Also pursuant to comment 15(c)-4, the disclosure provided outside the short form may, but is not required to, include the name of the government agency that established the government benefit account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau agrees with commenters that the notice regarding registration of the prepaid account that would have been required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">12</em>) is likely not necessary for government benefit accounts, as the registration process is typically completed before the account is opened. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(2)(xi) below, the final rule does not require the statement regarding registration where customer identification and verification occurs for all prepaid accounts within the prepaid program before the account is opened.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(b)(2)(iv) Cash Reload Fee</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">4</em>) would have required disclosure of a fee for loading cash into a prepaid account using the term “Cash reload” or a substantially similar term. Cash reloads are one of the primary ways for a consumer to add funds to a prepaid account. As such, the Bureau believed that the existence of a cash reload service and the fee for using such a service, if any, is important for consumers to know insofar as this is a key feature of many prepaid accounts. Proposed Model Forms A-10(a) through (d) would have disclosed the cash reload fee on the top line of the short form disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also proposed to adopt comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">4</em>)-1, which would have provided guidance on what would be considered a cash reload fee. Specifically, the proposed comment explained that the cash reload fee, for example, would include the cost of adding cash at a point-of-sale terminal, the cost of purchasing an additional card or other device on which cash is loaded and then transferred into a prepaid account, or any other method a consumer may use to load cash into a prepaid account. This proposed comment would have also clarified that if a financial institution offers more than one method for a consumer to load cash into the prepaid account, proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(C) would have required that it only disclose the highest fee on the short form. The Bureau noted that consumers may incur additional third-party fees when loading cash onto a card or other access device; these expenses are typically not controlled by the financial institution or program manager and instead are charged by the entity selling the cash reload product. Such fees would not be disclosed on the proposed short form pursuant to proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(C)-2. The Bureau noted, however, that, pursuant to proposed comment 18(b)(2)(ii)(A)-3, fees imposed by third parties acting as an agent of the financial institution would always have to be disclosed in the long form.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As described in the proposal, the Bureau considered requiring financial institutions to list on the short form disclosure both cash reload methods discussed in proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">4</em>)-1: Loads via a point-of-sale terminal and loads via an additional card or other device. The Bureau, however, believed it was important to limit the amount of information on the short form disclosure to maintain its simplicity in order to facilitate consumer understanding of the information that is included. Further, in its pre-proposal consumer testing, the Bureau found that participants consistently understood a disclosure containing a single cash reload fee, and therefore the Bureau did not believe it was as important to include two fees for this fee type.<footnote ref="390">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report I at 20, 29, and 30.</footnote>

        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>One issuing bank and a number of consumer groups expressed concern that failing to reflect third-party fees in connection with the proposed disclosure of the cash reload fee in the short form might create consumer confusion given that it is a standard industry practice for reload network providers or third-party retailers, not the financial institutions that issue prepaid accounts, to provide and charge for the reloading of cash into prepaid accounts. In such circumstances, due to the prohibition on inclusion of third-party fees in the short form pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(C), a financial institution that does not offer proprietary cash reloading capabilities would typically disclose the cash reload fee as “$0,” while a financial institution that offers proprietary cash reloading capabilities would have to disclose the cost for the cash reload. In addition to confusing consumers, commenters suggested this outcome would result in a competitive disadvantage for financial institutions that offer proprietary systems, which are usually less expensive than third-party systems, and thereby dissuade financial institutions from offering this service. A trade association recommended eliminating the term “cash reload” fee in favor of “deposit” fee for consistency and clarity. An issuing bank recommended disclosure of a range of fees for cash reloads and a statement explaining where to find reload locations as well as allowing disclosure of the conditions under which the cash reload fee could be waived instead of the asterisk and linked statement for variable fees pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(C). A program manager commenter recommended permitting disclosure of a disclaimer for third-party charges for cash reloads. An office of a State Attorney General recommended prohibiting cash reload fees, particularly for payroll card accounts, but otherwise supported the disclosure.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">4</em>), renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(2)(iv), with certain modifications as described below. As in the proposal, the Bureau is requiring in the final rule disclosure of the cash reload fee in the top line of the short form because it is one of the primary ways consumers fund their prepaid accounts. The Bureau believes the disclosure in the short form of a single cash reload fee balances the most important information for consumers with the brevity and clarity necessary for optimal consumer comprehension and therefore declines to require disclosure of additional content in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(iv) as requested by commenters.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting the final rule with a notable change from the proposal. The final rule requires disclosure of the cash reload fee as the total of all charges from the financial institution and any third parties for a cash reload. <em data-original="E-03">See also</em> final § 1005.18(b)(3)(iv) and (v). The Bureau had intended the proposed rule to require disclosure of the complete cost of reloading cash. While the Bureau believes that a general prohibition on the disclosure of third-party fees in the short form is appropriate, the Bureau also believes that it is important to reflect the cost of a cash reload via a non-proprietary cash reload network and to avoid disfavoring particular prepaid market participants in connection with reload systems, which is a concern raised by several commenters. By requiring inclusion of the full cost of cash reloads, including third-party fees, consumers will receive full information about the amount of this key fee as well as ensuring standardized disclosure requirements among market participants. Final § 1005.18(b)(2)(iv) also reflects minor technical modifications for clarity.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">4</em>)-1, renumbered as comment 18(b)(2)(iv)-1, with modifications to reflect the above-referenced modification to the regulatory text. The comment provides several examples illustrating how financial institutions must disclose cash reload fees.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is persuaded that labeling this fee as “cash deposits,” rather than “cash reloads,” may be more meaningful to consumers in certain circumstances. Final comment 18(b)(2)(iv)-2 thus allows a financial institution that does not permit cash reloads via a third-party reload network but instead permits cash deposits, for example, in a bank branch, to use the term “cash deposit” instead of “cash reload.” Regarding the comment requesting that the Bureau ban fees for cash reloads, such request is outside the scope of this rulemaking.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The disclosure and updating of third-party cash reload fees is discussed in further detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(3) below.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, Regulation E currently contains provisions in § 1005.15 that are specifically applicable to an account established by a government agency for distributing government benefits to a consumer electronically. While such accounts are currently defined only in existing § 1005.15(a)(2), the Bureau stated its belief in the proposal that given the other modifications to Regulation E proposed therein, it was appropriate to explicitly add such accounts used for the distribution of government benefits as a stand-alone sub-definition of prepaid account as well. Specifically, the Bureau proposed to have § 1005.2(b)(3)(iii) state that the term prepaid account includes a government benefit account, as defined in existing § 1005.15(a)(2).</analysisParagraph>

             Consistent with its overall approach in specifying particular product types that are “prepaid accounts” before defining an additional, narrower category for the balance of covered accounts, the Bureau is finalizing the proposed language concerning government benefit accounts as § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(B) without any other changes. Relatedly, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.2(b)(3)(ii)(E) below, the Bureau has added an exclusion from the definition of government benefit accounts for accounts used to distribute needs-tested benefits in a program established by under State or local law or administered by a State or local agency. That exclusion is part of the existing definition of government benefit account in § 1005.15(a)(2), and the Bureau believes it should be repeated as part of final § 1005.2(b)(3).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>17(a) Definition</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1005.17 sets forth requirements that financial institutions must follow in order to provide an “overdraft service” to consumers related to consumers' accounts. Under existing § 1005.17, financial institutions must provide consumers with a notice describing the institution's overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions, and obtain the consumer's affirmative consent, before fees or charges may be assessed on the consumer's account for paying such overdrafts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1005.17(a) currently defines “overdraft service” to mean a service under which a financial institution assesses a fee or charge on a consumer's account held by the institution for paying a transaction (including a check or other item) when the consumer has insufficient or unavailable funds in the account. Existing § 1005.17(a) also provides that the term “overdraft service” does not include any payment of overdrafts pursuant to: (1) A line of credit subject to Regulation Z, including transfers from a credit card account, home equity line of credit, or overdraft line of credit; (2) a service that transfers funds from another account held individually or jointly by a consumer, such as a savings account; or (3) a line of credit or other transaction exempt from Regulation Z pursuant to existing Regulation Z § 1026.3(d). In adopting the provisions in what is now existing § 1005.17, the Board indicated that these methods of covering overdrafts were excluded because they require the express agreement of the consumer.<footnote ref="355">74 FR 59033, 59040 (Nov. 17, 2009).</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the <em data-original="E-03">Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z</em> section, in the proposal, the Bureau declined to extend the current regulatory scheme governing overdraft services on checking accounts to prepaid accounts, and instead proposed to regulate these types of services generally under Regulation Z (as well as Regulation E's compulsory use provision). The proposal would have amended existing § 1005.17(a)(1) to explain that the term “overdraft service” does not include credit plans that are accessed by prepaid cards that are credit cards under Regulation Z. Specifically, the proposal would have amended existing § 1005.17(a)(1) to provide that the term “overdraft service” does not include any payments of overdrafts pursuant to a line of credit or credit plan subject to Regulation Z, including transfers from a credit card account, home equity line of credit, overdraft line of credit, or a credit plan that is accessed by an access device for a prepaid account where the access device is a credit card under Regulation Z. Similar to the other exemptions from the definition of “overdraft service,” under proposed Regulation Z § 1026.12(a)(1) and proposed comment 12(a)(1)-7, credit card plans in connection with prepaid accounts would have required the express agreement of consumers in that, under the proposal, such plans could be added to previously issued prepaid accounts only upon a consumer's application or request. In addition, under proposed § 1005.18(g)(1) and proposed Regulation Z § 1026.12(h), a credit card account could not have been added to a previously issued prepaid account until 30 days after the prepaid account has been registered.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In the proposal, the Bureau also noted that the opt-in provision in existing § 1005.17 would not have applied to credit accessed by a prepaid card that would not have been a credit card under the proposal because the card could have only accessed credit that is not subject to any finance charge, as defined in Regulation Z § 1026.4, or any fee described in Regulation Z § 1026.4(c), and is not payable by written agreement in more than four installments. Specifically, existing § 1005.17(a) applies only to overdraft services where a financial institution assessed a fee or charge for the overdraft. For prepaid accounts under the proposal, any fees or charges for ATM or one-time “debit card” transactions (as that term is used in existing § 1005.17) that access an institution's overdraft service would have been considered “finance charges” under the proposal. Thus, under the proposal, a prepaid card that is not a credit card could not be charging any fees or charges for ATM or one-time “debit card” transactions (as that term is used in existing § 1005.17) for accessing the overdraft service, such that the opt-in provision in existing § 1005.17 would apply. Under the proposal, if a prepaid card were charging any fees or charges for ATM or one-time “debit card” transactions (as that term is used in existing § 1005.17) that accessed the overdraft service, the prepaid card would have been a credit card under Regulation Z. In that case, the prepaid card would not have been subject to the opt-in requirement in existing § 1005.17, but would be subject to provisions of Regulation Z, as discussed above.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Comments Received and the Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive specific comment on the proposed changes to existing § 1005.17(a)(1), other than those related to general comments from industry not to cover overdraft plans offered on prepaid accounts under Regulation Z and instead cover these overdraft plans under Regulation E § 1005.17. See the <em data-original="E-03">Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z</em> section for a discussion of those comments.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail below, the final rule moves the language in proposed § 1005.17(a)(1) that specifically would have provided that credit plans accessed by prepaid cards that are credit cards are exempt from the definition of “overdraft service” to new § 1005.17(a)(4) and revises it to be consistent with new Regulation Z § 1026.61. New § 1005.17(a)(4) provides that a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61 is not a “overdraft service” under final § 1005.17(a).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, as discussed in more detail below, consistent with the proposal, new § 1005.17(a)(4) also provides that credit extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of a prepaid account that meets the conditions of new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(4) is not an “overdraft service” under final § 1005.17(a). As discussed below, a prepaid card that accesses such credit is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new Regulation Z § 1026.61.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Covered separate credit features accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card.</em> Consistent with the proposal, the opt-in provisions in final § 1005.17 will not apply to the payment of overdrafts pursuant to a credit feature that is accessible by a prepaid card that is a credit card. The final rule moves the language in proposed § 1005.17(a)(1) that specifically would have provided that credit plans accessed by prepaid cards that are credit cards are exempt from the definition of “overdraft service” to new § 1005.17(a)(4) and revises it to be consistent with new Regulation Z § 1026.61. New § 1005.17(a)(4) provides that a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61 is not a “overdraft service” under final § 1005.17(a). This exception is consistent with existing § 1005.17(a)(1) which exempts from the term “overdraft service” under existing § 1005.17(a) any payment of overdrafts pursuant to a line of credit subject to Regulation Z § 1026, including transfers from a credit card account, home equity line of credit, or overdraft line of credit. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new Regulation Z § 1026.61 and a credit card under final Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature. Thus, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card is a credit card account subject to Regulation Z.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Credit features on prepaid accounts not accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card.</em> As discussed above, in the proposal, the Bureau also noted that the opt-in provision in existing § 1005.17 would not have applied to credit accessed by a prepaid card that would not have been a credit card under the proposal because the card only accesses credit that is not subject to any finance charge, as defined in Regulation Z § 1026.4, or any fee described in Regulation Z § 1026.4(c), and is not payable by written agreement in more than four installments.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z § 1026.61 below, the Bureau has decided to exclude prepaid cards from being covered as credit cards under Regulation Z when they access certain specified types of credit. First, under new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii), a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a “non-covered separate credit feature,” which means that the separate credit feature either (1) cannot be accessed in the course of a prepaid card transaction to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers, or (2) is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. Second, under new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(4), a prepaid card also is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card when the prepaid card accesses incidental credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account where the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit. A prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new Regulation Z § 1026.61 or a credit card under final Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) when it accesses credit from these types of credit features. For more detailed explanations of when prepaid cards are not credit cards under Regulation Z, see the section-by-section analyses of Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(2) and (4) below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consistent with the proposal, the Bureau is adding new § 1005.17(a)(4) to provide that the term “overdraft service” does not include any payment of overdrafts pursuant to credit extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of a prepaid account that meets the conditions set forth in new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(4). As discussed above, a prepaid card would not be a hybrid prepaid-card when it accesses this credit. With respect to such an overdraft credit that meets the conditions for the exception in new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(4), a prepaid account issuer could still qualify for this exemption if the issuer is charging a per transaction fee for paying a transaction on the prepaid account, so long as the amount of the per transaction fee is not higher based on whether the transaction only accesses asset funds in the prepaid account or also accesses credit. For example, assume a $1.50 transaction charge is imposed on the prepaid account for each paid transaction that is made with the prepaid card, including transactions that only access asset funds, transactions that take the account balance negative, and transactions that occur when the account balance is already negative. A prepaid account issuer could still qualify for the exception under new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(4) even if it was charging this $1.50 transaction fee, so long as the prepaid account issuer meets the conditions of new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(4).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adding new § 1005.17(a)(4) to provide that credit which is exempt from Regulation Z under new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(4) is not an overdraft service under final § 1005.17(a) and thus would not be subject to the opt-in requirements in final § 1005.17. This is true even though the prepaid account issuer may be charging a per transaction fee as described above on the prepaid account, including for transactions that access incidental credit as described above. The Bureau believes that the opt-in requirements in final § 1005.17 are not necessary for this types of overdraft credit given that the per transaction fee is the same amount regardless of whether the transaction is only accessing funds in the prepaid account or is also accessing credit.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that a prepaid account issuer does not satisfy the exception in new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(4) from the definition of “hybrid prepaid-credit card” if it charges on a prepaid account transaction fees for credit extensions on the prepaid account where the amount of the fee is higher based on whether the transaction accesses asset funds in the prepaid account or accesses credit. For example, assume a $15 transaction charge is imposed on the prepaid account each time a transaction is authorized or paid when there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset balance of the prepaid account at the time of the authorization or settlement. Also assume, a $1.50 fee is imposed each time a transaction on the prepaid account only accesses funds in the asset balance of the prepaid account. The $15 charge would disqualify the prepaid account issuer for the exception under new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(4) and the prepaid card would be a “hybrid prepaid-credit card” with respect to that prepaid account. In that case, the prepaid account issuer still would not be subject to final § 1005.17, but would be subject to Regulation Z. In that case, under final Regulation Z § 1026.61(b), the credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card must be structured as a “covered separate credit feature” as discussed above.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>While overdraft credit described in new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(4) is exempt from final § 1005.17, this incidental credit generally is covered under Regulation E. For example, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.12(a) above, Regulation E's provisions in final §§ 1005.11 and 1005.18(e) regarding error resolution would apply to extensions of this credit. In addition, such credit extensions would be disclosed on Regulation E periodic statements under final § 1005.18(c)(1) or, if the financial institution follows the periodic statement alternative in final § 1005.18(c)(1), on the electronic and written histories of the consumer's prepaid account transactions. This overdraft credit, however, is exempt from the compulsory use provision in final § 1005.10(e)(1). See the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.10(e)(1) above.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Non-covered separate credit features that are functioning as an overdraft credit features with respect to prepaid accounts also typically will not be subject to final § 1005.17 because these credit features typically will be lines of credit that are subject to Regulation Z, which are expressly exempt from the definition of “overdraft service” under final § 1005.17(a)(1).</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(A) would have defined a prepaid account as either issued on a prepaid basis to a consumer in a specified amount or not issued on a prepaid basis but capable of being loaded with funds thereafter. This portion of the proposed definition expanded upon the phrase “issued on a prepaid basis” used in the Gift Card Rule's definition of general-use prepaid card in § 1005.20(a)(3),<footnote ref="302">Section 1005.20(a)(3) defines the term general use prepaid card as “a card, code, or other device that is: (i) Issued on a prepaid basis primarily for personal, family, or household purposes to a consumer in a specified amount, whether or not that amount may be increased or reloaded, in exchange for payment; and (ii) Redeemable upon presentation at multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, or usable at automated teller machines.”</footnote>
             by also including a prepaid product that was “not issued on a prepaid basis but capable of being loaded with funds thereafter.”</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As it explained in the proposal, the Bureau sought to ensure that accounts that are not loaded at acquisition are nonetheless eligible to be prepaid accounts. The Bureau proposed this approach to address concerns that prepaid providers could restructure existing products to avoid coverage by the proposed rule if they were to separate account acquisition from initial funding. In addition, the Bureau believed the proposed provision would have ensured that consumers who used prepaid accounts received the protections in the proposed rule—particularly the pre-acquisition disclosures regarding fees and other key terms—prior to and upon establishment of the account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 2(b)(3)(i)-3 would have clarified that to be “issued on a prepaid basis,” a prepaid account had to be loaded with funds when it was first provided to the consumer for use. For example, if a consumer purchased a prepaid account and provided funds that were loaded onto a card at the time of purchase, the prepaid account would have been issued on a prepaid basis. A prepaid account offered for sale in a retail store would not have been issued on a prepaid basis until it was purchased by the consumer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 2(b)(3)(i)-4 would have explained that a prepaid account that was not issued on a prepaid basis but was capable of being loaded with funds thereafter included a prepaid card issued to a consumer with a zero balance to which funds could be loaded by the consumer or a third party subsequent to issuance. This would not have included a product that could never store funds, such as a digital wallet that only held payment credentials for other accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 2(b)(3)(i)-5 would have clarified that to satisfy proposed § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(A), a prepaid account would have to either be issued on a prepaid basis or be capable of being loaded with funds. This would have meant that the prepaid account had to be capable of holding funds, rather than merely acting as a pass-through vehicle. For example, if a product was only capable of storing a consumer's payment credentials for other accounts but was incapable of having funds stored on it, such a product would not have been a prepaid account. However, if a product allowed a consumer to transfer funds, which could be stored before the consumer designated a destination for the funds, the product would have satisfied proposed § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(A).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With these examples, the Bureau sought to make clear that it did not intend to extend the proposed definition of prepaid account to a product that could never store funds. To the extent that a digital wallet, for example, merely stores payment credentials (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> a consumer's bank account or payment card information), rather than storing the funds themselves, the digital wallet would not have been considered a prepaid account under the proposed rule. If, however, a digital wallet allowed a consumer to store funds in it directly, then the digital wallet would have been a prepaid account if the other criteria of the proposed definition were also met. Finally, proposed comment 2(b)(3)(i)-6 would have provided that prepaid accounts did not have to be reloadable by the consumer or a third party.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, some industry commenters urged the Bureau to limit the final rule to those products that could be reloaded by a consumer, arguing that such products were more likely to act as transaction account substitutes. Those comments are summarized in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.2(b)(3) above. In short, these commenters argued that, to the extent the Bureau was seeking to create a uniform regulatory regime for like products, non-reloadable products did not function like other accounts already covered by Regulation E and thus should be excluded from coverage. They noted, for example, that non-reloadable cards were not generally accompanied by an expectation of a continued relationship between the financial institution and the consumer. In addition, these commenters argued, such accounts were largely used as a substitute for cash, such that adding disclosure and other substantive requirements to these cards would add unnecessary complexity that would far outweigh consumer expectations or needs with respect to these products. Commenters also noted that with respect to many types of non-reloadable cards, such as cards used to disburse insurance claim proceeds or tax refunds, consumers did not in fact have a choice with respect to which card they received. Comparison shopping in such circumstances, they argued, was unhelpful. Finally, with respect to the Bureau's proposed rationale that including non-reloadable accounts in the definition of prepaid account would help prevent evasion, a trade association stated that they believed that such evasion was unlikely, and further argued that the Bureau could address this risk through the adoption of an anti-evasion provision specifically aimed at preventing financial institutions from morphing their products to avoid coverage under this rule.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to the clarification in proposed comment 2(b)(3)(i)-5 that the prepaid account definition only covered accounts that were capable of holding funds (rather than just acting as a pass-through), several commenters, including issuing banks, a payment network, a digital wallet provider, and a consumer group, agreed with the proposed approach. These commenters asserted that, to the extent a digital wallet was simply acting as a pass-through of credentials for accounts that were already protected under Regulation E (or other regulations), consumers using those digital wallets were already receiving sufficient protections. As stated in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.2(b)(3) above, other commenters objected to the Bureau's decision to cover digital wallets under the rule in any respect.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is finalizing the general content of proposed § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(A), renumbered as § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>), with minor edits to streamline the language. Specifically, final § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) defines a prepaid account, in part, as an account that is issued on a prepaid basis in a specified amount or not issued on a prepaid basis but capable of being loaded with funds thereafter. In addition, the Bureau is finalizing proposed comments 2(b)(3)(i)-3, -4, -5, and -6, renumbered as comments 2(b)(3)(i)-4, -5, -6, and -7, largely as proposed, with some minor revisions for clarity.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau continues to believe that it would be inappropriate to exclude a product from the definition of prepaid account based on whether it can be reloaded or who can (or cannot) load funds into the account. The Bureau notes that products that may limit consumers from loading funds include payroll card accounts, which are already subject to Regulation E. Other products reloadable only by a third party also may hold funds which similarly represent a meaningful portion of a consumer's available funds. This may be true, for example, for students receiving financial aid disbursements or a consumer receiving worker's compensation payments. The Bureau believes that, like consumers relying on payroll card accounts,<footnote ref="303">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 71 FR 51437, 51441 (Aug. 30, 2006).</footnote>
             consumers may use these products as transaction account substitutes for a substantial period of time even when consumers cannot reload the cards themselves, and thus such products should be similarly protected. In addition, while it is true that non-reloadable products are distinct from transaction accounts (to the extent that the funds will eventually be spent down in their entirety and the account abandoned), while the accounts are in use, they may be used to conduct a significant portion of a consumer's transactions or hold a substantial portion of a consumer's funds, and as such the Bureau believes that they warrant the protections of Regulation E, including error resolution in particular. Furthermore, the Bureau believes that extending protections to all broadly usable prepaid accounts is necessary to avoid consumer confusion as to what protections apply to similar accounts. Finally, the Bureau remains concerned that, if it were to exclude non-reloadable cards from the definition of prepaid account, a financial institution could evade the Bureau's rulemaking on prepaid accounts by issuing non-reloadable cards repeatedly to the same consumer, such as to provide repeated disbursements (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> providing a new student loan disbursement card each semester). The Bureau does not believe that an anti-evasion provision is the optimal method for dealing with this concern; rather, the Bureau is concerned that, at this time, such a provision would in fact cause some uncertainty without addressing all other concerns.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also is not persuaded by commenters' objections to the Bureau's proposal to cover digital wallets that can hold funds under the definition of prepaid account. The Bureau continues to believe that digital wallets that can hold funds operate in large part in a similar manner to physical or online prepaid accounts—a consumer can load funds into the account, spend the funds at multiple, unaffiliated merchants (or conduct P2P transfers), and reload the account once the funds are depleted. Accordingly, the Bureau believes that consumers who transact using digital wallets deserve the same protections as consumers who use other prepaid accounts. Indeed, as with other prepaid accounts, a consumer's digital wallet could fall victim to erroneous or fraudulent transactions. In addition, while the Bureau understands that most digital wallets available today do not typically charge many fees (with few exceptions, such as, for example, foreign exchange fees in certain circumstances or a fee for having funds from the account issued to the consumer in the form of a check), it is impossible to rule out that existing or new digital wallet providers will charge such fees in the future. If fees do become standard in this space, consumers ought to know what those fees are and when they will be imposed.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in greater detail in the section-by-section analyses of § 1005.2(b)(3) and (3)(i)(C) above, the Bureau received several comments requesting that it revise the proposed definition of prepaid account to provide a clearer line between accounts that were already covered by the existing definition of account in § 1005.2(b) and accounts that would be covered by the newly created prepaid account definition. A number of commenters, including a payment network and an industry trade association, noted a specific lack of clarity with respect to products that could arguably qualify as both. To illustrate, they noted that some prepaid accounts offer preauthorized check-writing capability, while some checking accounts allow consumers to transact using the ACH routing number or online passcode. These commenters asked the Bureau to resolve this ambiguity.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As set forth in the section-by-section analyses of § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(C) and (D)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) above, the Bureau is finalizing several changes to the proposed definition of prepaid account to provide a clearer delineation between accounts that are covered by Regulation E generally and accounts that will be covered as prepaid accounts. In addition to those changes, the Bureau is also adding a third prong to § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D). Pursuant to final § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>), only accounts that are not otherwise a checking account, a share draft account, or a NOW account will qualify as a prepaid account. For purposes of this element, the Bureau does not consider the capability to issue preauthorized checks to qualify an account as checking, share draft, or NOW accounts. The Bureau notes that it intended to exclude checking and other demand deposit accounts from the proposed definition of prepaid account by including the phrase “not otherwise an account under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.” The Bureau acknowledges, however, that its proposed approach did not sufficiently resolve the potential ambiguity referenced by commenters. The Bureau believes that its express reference in final § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">3</em>) to the account not being a checking, share draft, or NOW account, together with the primary function test in final § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), more directly address these concerns.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Comment 31(b)-1 Disclosures Provided as Applicable</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)-1 to the 2012 Final Rule provides examples of when certain disclosures may not be applicable and therefore need not be disclosed.  Because of the changes that the Bureau is making with respect to the disclosure of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider, the 2013 Final Rule makes certain revisions to the commentary in the 2012 Final Rule for consistency and clarification.  Comment 31(b)-1 clarifies that for disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(i) through (vii), a provider may disclose a term and state that an amount or item is “not applicable,” “N/A,” or “None.”  Consistent with the changes made in the 2013 Final Rule regarding the disclosure of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, comment 31(b)-1 is revised to state that if fees are not imposed or taxes are not collected in connection with a particular transaction the provider need not provide the disclosures about fees and taxes generally required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii), the disclosures about covered third-party fees generally required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), or the disclaimers about non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the provider generally required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii). </analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(b)(2)(ii) Per Purchase Fee</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) would have required disclosure of two fees for making a purchase using a prepaid account, both for when a consumer uses a PIN and when a consumer provides a signature, including at point-of-sale terminals, by telephone, on a Web site, or by any other means, using the term “Per purchase fee” or a substantially similar term, and “with PIN” or “with sig.,” or substantially similar terms.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The proposal explained that, although the Bureau understands that most prepaid accounts do not charge per transaction fees for purchases of goods or services from a merchant, some do. The Bureau said that the impact of these fees could be substantial for consumers who make multiple purchases. Often these fees are charged when periodic fees are not, and thus a consumer may be choosing between a prepaid account that has no monthly fee but charges for each purchase and a prepaid account that has a monthly fee but no per purchase charge. Therefore, the Bureau believed it appropriate for all prepaid accounts to disclose on the short form both whether there is a per purchase fee and, if so, the fee for making those purchases. Proposed Model Forms A-10(a) through (d) would have disclosed the per purchase fees on the top line of the short form.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau's proposed rule further recognized that a handful of prepaid accounts charge a different per purchase fee depending on whether the purchase is processed as a signature or PIN transaction. While PIN debit transactions require input of the accountholder's PIN code at the time of authorization of the transaction, for a signature transaction, the accountholder may sign for the transaction but does not need to enter his or her PIN code. The Bureau therefore proposed model forms for prepaid accounts that disclose both fees for these two authorization methods.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>No commenters objected to inclusion of per purchase fees generally in the short form disclosure. An industry trade association, an issuing bank, and a program manager commented on the relevance of requiring the separate disclosure of per purchase fees for PIN and signature. These commenters said that such methods may become obsolete with the evolution of new cardholder verification methods (CVMs) and that many current transactions do not technically require either PIN or signature, such as online purchases. These commenters, plus another industry trade association and the office of a State Attorney General, suggested permitting disclosure of one per purchase fee if the PIN and signature fees are the same. The office of a State Attorney General also urged the Bureau to ban per purchase fees for payroll card accounts.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii), with certain modifications as described below. Because a per purchase fee could be significant for consumers who make multiple purchases with their prepaid card, the Bureau continues to believe it appropriate for all prepaid accounts to disclose on the short form whether there is a per purchase fee and, if so, the fee for making a purchase. However, the Bureau understands that most prepaid accounts do not charge fees for each purchase transaction and, for those that do, the Bureau believes that distinguishing between PIN and signature when other methods of cardholder verification may now or in the future be available may be confusing to consumers. The Bureau further understands that new cardholder verification methods are rapidly evolving. For these reasons, the Bureau believes disclosure of the breakdown of specific per purchase fees has less consumer benefit than disclosure of one per purchase fee, <em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the highest fee charged for making a purchase as required pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(3)(i), which is discussed in detail below. Thus, the Bureau is finalizing this provision as proposed, except it is requiring disclosure of only a single fee for making a purchase using the prepaid account instead of requiring disclosure of two fees (both for when a consumer uses a PIN and when a consumer uses a signature to verify the purchase). The Bureau has also made other technical revisions to this provision for clarity.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>With regard to the comment recommending that the Bureau ban per purchase fees for payroll card accounts, such a request is outside the scope of this rulemaking.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>31(b)(1)(iv) Exchange Rate</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(iv) required the disclosure of any exchange rate used by the provider for the remittance transfer, rounded to the nearest 1/100th of a decimal point, consistent with EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(iii). The proposed rule stated that the exchange rate must be described using the term “Exchange Rate” or a substantially similar term. The proposed rule did not permit floating rates, where the exchange rate is set when the designated recipient claims the funds.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters strongly supported the prohibition of unknown or floating exchange rates. Many industry commenters, however, urged that the final rule should accommodate floating rates and other circumstances in which an exchange rate may not be known at the time the sender requests the remittance transfer. A few industry commenters argued that the statute does not require the disclosure of an exchange rate set by institutions other than the remittance transfer provider. The commenters stated that by requiring the disclosure of the exchange rate to be used by the remittance transfer provider for the remittance transfer, EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(iii) only requires disclosure of an exchange rate that the remittance transfers provider itself set for the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For example, industry commenters stated that most credit unions offering international transfers do not perform currency conversions themselves, but instead rely on correspondent banks or other business partners to do so. Some industry commenters also stated that most credit unions offering international transfers work with currency providers in real time to contract for exchange rates. The commenters argued that this allows the credit unions to provide their members with the most competitive exchange rates. However, in such an arrangement the exchange rate that will be applied is only known at the time the contract is accepted, and would not be known at the time disclosures are provided to the senders. Similarly, other industry commenters stated that with their current processes and systems, they would know an exchange rate once a remittance transfer is processed, but not when the remittance transfer is requested.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters also stated the exchange rate cannot be determined at the time of the request when a sender designates the receipt of a transaction in one currency, but the receiving account is denominated in another currency. In those cases, the receiving institution must convert the funds into another currency in order to complete the transfer. One industry commenter stated that its customers sometimes request remittance transfers to be sent to their foreign accounts in U.S. dollars. These senders, however, have arrangements with the recipient institutions holding their foreign accounts to convert the funds to the currencies of the accounts either at the spot rates available at the time the accounts are credited or at rates pre-arranged by contracts between the senders and the recipient institutions. One industry commenter stated that, in some countries, a recipient may choose to be paid in one of multiple currencies. The commenter also stated that it permits consumers to change the designated country for pick up. In these cases, the currency in which funds will be received may change at the option of the recipient.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>A Federal Reserve Bank commenter, as well as industry commenters, argued that requiring a fixed exchange rate for purposes of providing an exchange rate disclosure would result in less favorable exchange rates for senders. These commenters stated that if providers are required to fix the exchange rate, they will increase the spread they use in order to minimize the risks associated with rate volatility, so the cost of sending remittance transfers would increase for senders. One money transmitter commenter argued that requiring a disclosure of a fixed rate could also lead remittance transfer providers to stop providing services to some locations in which they have historically used floating rates. This commenter noted that such a requirement would require it to renegotiate its contracts with approximately 100 foreign agents representing about 10,000 locations that currently offer only floating rates. This commenter stated that this change would affect about a half million customers annually.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter believed that a remittance transfer provider should instead be permitted to disclose that the exchange rate will be changed at the rate set by a daily central bank or other official rate plus or minus a fixed offset, such as a commission. Other industry commenters suggested permitting disclosure of an estimated exchange rate, as long as the provider also discloses that the rate is subject to change. A Federal Reserve Bank commenter believed that floating exchange rate products should be exempted from the disclosure provisions in the rule.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau interprets the statute to require a remittance transfer provider to disclose to the sender the exchange rate to be used for the remittance transfer to the sender, both at the time the sender requests the remittance transfer and when the sender pays for the transfer. This interpretation is based on several factors. First, the fact that the exchange rate may be set by another institution involved in the remittance transfer does not change the fact that it will be used by the remittance transfer provider in effectuating the sender's request. Second, the statute specifically requires disclosure of the amount to be received by the designated recipient, using the values of the currency into which the funds will be exchanged. This disclosure requires a provider to determine the exchange rate to be used to effectuate the transfer, whether that rate is set by the remittance transfer provider or a third party.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The purpose of the statute supports the same conclusion. As discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the disclosure was intended to provide senders with certainty regarding the exchange rate and the amount of currency their designated recipients would receive. Senders would not be able to tell, for example, whether the funds they transmit are sufficient to pay household expenses and other bills where remittance products are based on floating rates.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau understands, however, that there may be instances in which a sender will request funds to be delivered in a particular currency, but the funds are later converted into another currency due to facts that cannot be known to the provider. In these circumstances, the Bureau believes the remittance transfer provider complies with the requirement to disclose the exchange rate when it discloses information based on the request of the sender, even if the funds are ultimately received in a different currency. If the sender does not know the currency in which the funds will be received or requests funds to be received in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, the Bureau believes that the provider may assume that the currency in which funds will be received is the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded. <em data-original="E-03">See also</em> comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-1, below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(b)(iv) of the final rule requires disclosure of the exchange rate used by the provider for the remittance transfer, as proposed. Comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-1 clarifies that if the designated recipient will receive funds in a currency other than the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, a remittance transfer provider must disclose the exchange rate to be used by the provider for the remittance transfer. An exchange rate that is estimated must be disclosed pursuant to the requirements of § 1005.32, discussed below. A remittance transfer provider may not disclose, for example, that an exchange rate is “unknown,” “floating,” or “to be determined.”</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-1 further clarifies that if a provider does not have specific knowledge regarding the currency in which the funds will be received, the provider may rely on a sender's representation as to the currency in which funds will be received for purposes of determining whether an exchange rate is applied to the transfer. For example, if a sender requests that a remittance transfer be deposited into an account in U.S. dollars, the provider need not disclose an exchange rate, even if the account is actually denominated in Mexican pesos and the funds are converted prior to deposit into the account. If a sender does not know the currency in which funds will be received, the provider may assume that the currency in which funds will be received is the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded. The Bureau notes that if a provider does not independently have specific knowledge of the currency in which funds will be received, the provider may rely on the sender's representation as to the currency in which funds will be received. For example, the rule does not impose on providers a duty to inquire about this information with a third party.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters also argued that the exchange rate should be permitted to include more than two decimal places, consistent with their current disclosure practices. One industry commenter stated that providing exchange rates that include more than two decimal places provides senders with more accurate and detailed exchange rate information.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees that it may be appropriate for some providers to disclose an exchange rate that includes more than two decimal places, because a provider may determine that the disclosure would provide a sender with a more accurate representation of the remittance transfer's cost, based on the particular type of transaction or type of currency being used. However, the Bureau also believes that some providers may determine that rounding to fewer digits may sufficiently inform senders of the cost of the exchange. The Bureau is also mindful that a disclosure that includes a long string of numbers could confuse some senders. The Bureau believes it is appropriate to permit a remittance transfer provider to disclose an exchange rate rounded to a number of decimal places that best reflects the cost to the sender, within a range that will not potentially confuse the sender.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) authority in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) to permit the exchange rate to be rounded consistently for each currency to no fewer than two decimal places and no more than four decimal places. The exchange rate must be disclosed using the term “Exchange Rate” or a substantially similar term. Comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-2 of the final rule is revised to reflect the more flexible rounding requirements. Comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-2 clarifies that the exchange rate disclosed by the provider for the remittance transfer is required to be rounded. The provider may round to two, three, or four decimal places, at its option. For example, if one U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9483779 Mexican pesos, a provider may disclose that the U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9484 Mexican pesos. The provider may alternatively disclose, for example, that the U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.948 pesos or 11.95 pesos. On the other hand, if one U.S. dollar exchanges for exactly 11.9 Mexican pesos, the provider may disclose that “US$1=11.9 MXN” in lieu of, for example, “US$1=11.90 MXN.”</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Though the Bureau is permitting flexibility for rounding exchange rate disclosures, the Bureau believes that each provider should disclose its exchange rates in a consistent manner. The Bureau believes that if a provider were permitted to round exchange rates for a particular currency on a transaction-by-transaction basis, a provider could round exchange rates differently in order to make the exchange rate appear to be more favorable. For example, the Bureau does not believe a provider that typically rounds to four decimal places for a specific currency (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> the U.S. dollar exchanges for 0.7551 Euros) should be permitted to round to two decimal places for some of those currency transactions (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> the U.S. dollar exchanges for 0.76 Euros). Comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-2 thus clarifies that the exchange rate disclosed for the remittance transfer must be rounded consistently for each currency. For example, a provider may not round to two decimal places for some transactions exchanged into Euros and round to four decimal places for other transactions exchanged into Euros.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, a provider may use an exchange rate that is not necessarily set by the provider itself. The final rule adds a new comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-3 to clarify that the exchange rate used by the provider and applied to the remittance transfer need not be set by that provider. For example, an exchange rate set by an intermediary institution and applied to the remittance transfer would be the exchange rate used for the remittance transfer and must be disclosed by the provider.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters and an industry trade association asked the Bureau to clarify how the exchange rate requirements would apply when a remittance transfer involves a prepaid card. These commenters asked how disclosures, such as the exchange rate, could be provided in accordance with the timing provisions in the May 2011 Proposed Rule when a provider would not know when the recipient would withdraw funds abroad or how much the recipient would withdraw. To the extent a prepaid card is covered by the rule, <em data-original="E-03">see</em> § 1005.30(e), the funds that will be received by the designated recipient are those that are loaded on to the prepaid card by the sender at the time of the transaction. Often a prepaid card is both funded and loaded in U.S. dollars, and funds remain on the card in U.S. dollars until a cardholder withdraws funds in a foreign country. In these instances, a provider need not provide the exchange rate disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), because a recipient will receive the currency in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 31(b)-1.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, a Federal Reserve Bank commenter noted that the exchange rate cannot be determined when a sender initiates payment on a recurring basis. The Bureau recognizes the unique challenges relating to recurring payments, and the final rule provides alternative provisions for these circumstances in § 1005.36, discussed below.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>Specifically, the Bureau proposed § 1005.15(f), which would have cross-referenced proposed § 1005.18(f) to require that, in addition to disclosing any fees imposed by a government agency for EFTs or the right to make such transfers, the agency would have also had to provide in its initial disclosures given pursuant to § 1005.7(b)(5) all other fees imposed by the agency in connection with a government benefit account. For each fee, an agency would have had to disclose the amount of the fee, the conditions, if any, under which the fee may have been imposed, waived, or reduced, and, to the extent known, whether any third-party fees would have been applied. These disclosures pursuant to proposed §§ 1005.15(f) and 1005.18(f) would have had to include all of the information required to be disclosed pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii)(B) and would have needed to be provided in a form substantially similar to proposed Sample Form A-10(e). Further, for consistency purposes and to facilitate consumer understanding of a government benefit account's terms, the fee disclosure provided pursuant to § 1005.7(b)(5), as modified by proposed § 1005.18(f), would have to be in the same format of the long form disclosure requirement of proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii)(A).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive any comments regarding this portion of the proposal. Thus, to further the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account users, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to finalize an adjustment of the requirement implemented in existing § 1005.7(b)(5) for government benefit accounts. Accordingly, it is adopting § 1005.15(f) largely as proposed to cross-reference the requirements set forth in final § 1005.18(f), with revisions for parity with the final text of § 1005.18(f).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that it is also finalizing certain revisions to proposed § 1005.18(f). The specific revisions and their respective rationales are discussed in detail the section-by-section analyses of § 1005.18(f) and (f)(3) below. In summary, the Bureau has revised proposed § 1005.18(f), renumbered as § 1005.18(f)(1), to require that a financial institution include, as part of the initial disclosures given pursuant to § 1005.7, all of the information required to be disclosed in its pre-acquisition long form disclosure pursuant to final § 1005.18(b). The Bureau has added new § 1005.18(f)(2) to make clear that a financial institution must provide a change-in-terms notice, pursuant to § 1005.8(a), for any change in a term or condition required to be disclosed under §§ 1005.7 or 1005.18(f)(1). Finally, § 1005.18(f)(3) sets forth the required disclosures that must appear on prepaid account access devices (in the proposal, these requirements would have been set forth in proposed § 1005.18(b)(7)). To clarify the application of the requirement in § 1005.18(f)(3) that the name, Web site URL, and telephone number of the financial institution be disclosed on the prepaid account access device to government benefit accounts, the Bureau is adding new comment 15(f)-1. Pursuant to new comment 15(f)-1, the financial institution whose name must be disclosed pursuant to the requirement in § 1005.18(f)(3) is the financial institution that directly holds the account or issues the account's access device.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(b)(2)(v) ATM Balance Inquiry Fees</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Directly below the top line in the short form disclosure, the Bureau proposed to include balance inquiry fees charged by a financial institution for inquiring into the prepaid account's balance at an ATM. Specifically, proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">5</em>) would have required disclosure of two fees for using an ATM to check the balance of a consumer's prepaid account, both within and outside of the financial institution's network or a network affiliated with the financial institution, using the term “ATM balance inquiry” or a substantially similar term, and “in-network” or “out-of-network,” or substantially similar terms. Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">5</em>)-1 would have clarified that if the fee imposed on a consumer for using an ATM in a foreign country to check the balance of a consumer's prepaid account is different from the fee charged for using an ATM within or outside the financial institution's network or a network affiliated with the financial institution in the United States, a financial institution would not disclose the foreign ATM balance inquiry fee pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">5</em>), but could be required to do so as part of the proposed incidence-based fee disclosure pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">8</em>).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believed that, just as it is important for consumers to know that different fees could be imposed for ATM withdrawals depending on whether the ATM is in-network or out-of-network, it is also important for consumers to know that different fees could be imposed when requesting balance inquiries at an ATM in a financial institution's network or outside of the network. However, the Bureau did not propose to include balance inquiry fees in the top line of the short form disclosure, because it believed that it is less common for consumers to initiate ATM balance inquiry transactions compared to withdrawals at ATMs.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received comments about the proposed ATM balance inquiry fees disclosure from several industry and consumer group commenters, and an office of a State Attorney General. In response to the Bureau's question regarding placement of ATM balance inquiry fees on the short form disclosure, a program manager stated that placing these fees below the top line of the short form disclosure is sufficient, because consumers are not assessed this fee frequently enough to justify its inclusion in the top line. According to this commenter, as well as a trade association and issuing bank, an ATM is one of the most expensive ways for consumers to check their balance on a prepaid card. The program manager added that consumers generally use free and more convenient methods to obtain balance information such as via interactive voice response, the internet, email, and text message.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A consumer group suggested that the Bureau either eliminate the disclosure to save space or require financial institutions to disclose all methods a consumer may use to check the consumer's prepaid account balance to make consumers aware of free balance inquiry methods. Another consumer group recommended that the Bureau replace the “or” in the text of the ATM balance inquiry fee disclosure in the proposed model short form disclosure with a slash (“/”) to distinguish between in- and out-of-network fees. If there are two fees listed, the commenter stated that the use of “or,” as opposed to “/,” may create uncertainty with respect to which fee is the in-network fee, and which fee is the out-of-network fee.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>An office of a State Attorney General supported the Bureau's proposal as an alternative to its primary recommendation that the Bureau ban ATM balance inquiry fees for payroll card accounts. The commenter further suggested that the Bureau require financial institutions to list the in-network and out-of-network ATM balance inquiry fee on separate lines of the short form to enhance consumer comprehension.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">5</em>), renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(2)(v), with minor technical modifications for clarity. The Bureau continues to believe consumers should know the different fees they could be charged for in-network versus out-of-network ATM balance inquiries but that these fees are not incurred frequently enough to merit disclosure in the top line of the short form. The Bureau is also adopting proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(5)-1, renumbered as comment 18(b)(2)(v)-1, with several revisions. Final comment 18(b)(2)(v)-1 explains that a financial institution may not disclose its fee (if any) for using an ATM to check the balance of the prepaid account in a foreign country in the disclosure required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(v), although it may be required to disclose that fee as an additional fee type pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes the final rule's ATM balance inquiry fee disclosure requirement balances the most important information for consumers with the brevity and clarity necessary for optimal consumer comprehension and therefore declines to require disclosure of additional content in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(v) as requested by one of the commenters. Regarding the recommendation that the Bureau use a slash (“/”) instead of “or” to distinguish between in- and out-of-network fees, the Bureau notes that in post-proposal consumer testing of prototype short forms nearly all participants were able to correctly identify the ATM balance inquiry fee when using “or” and showed no indication of misunderstanding the distinction between in- and out-of-network fees, confirming the Bureau's understanding from pre-proposal testing.<footnote ref="391">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report II at 10 and 21.</footnote>
             Thus, the Bureau declines to make this change. Regarding the request that the Bureau ban fees for balance inquiries for payroll card accounts, such request is outside the scope of this rulemaking.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>Under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(ii), an “error” also included “a computational or bookkeeping error made by a remittance transfer provider relating to a remittance transfer.” This provision is similar to an existing computational or bookkeeping error provision for EFTs in § 1005.11(a)(iv). In implementing this provision of Regulation E, the Board noted that § 1005.11(a)(iv) (formerly § 205.11(a)(iv)) is intended to include “arithmetical errors, posting errors, errors in printing figures, and figures that were jumbled due to mechanical or electronic malfunction.” <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 44 FR 59480 (Oct. 15, 1979). Proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(ii) was meant to cover similar types of errors with respect to remittance transfers, such as circumstances in which a remittance transfer provider fails to reflect all fees that will be imposed in connection with the transfer or misapplies the applicable exchange rate in calculating the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient. As noted in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, notwithstanding that the designated recipient may receive the amount of currency stated on the receipt or combined disclosure, an error could be asserted because the provider incorrectly calculated the amount that should have been received. The Bureau did not receive any comments on proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(ii). The Bureau adopts this provision as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(a)(1)(ii).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(b)(4) Long Form Disclosure Content</title>
      <analysisParagraph>In addition to the short form, the proposed rule would have required financial institutions to provide a long form disclosure providing all fees and certain other specified information prior to the consumer's acquisition of a prepaid account. Proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii) would have provided that, in accordance with proposed § 1005.18(b)(1), a financial institution shall provide the disclosures listed in proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii)(A) through (E). In contrast to the short form, where the Bureau proposed very specific formatting requirements and model forms that would provide a safe harbor for compliance, the Bureau did not specify as detailed formatting requirements with regard to the long form in the proposal. It included proposed Sample Form A-10(e) as one possible way to organize the detailed fee information, but noted that long forms might vary more widely depending on the number of fees and conditions and therefore solicited comment on whether to provide a model form.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive any comments specifically regarding whether to provide a long form as a sample form or a model form. More general comments received regarding the Bureau's proposal to require financial institutions to provide long form disclosures pre-acquisition, and the Bureau's reasons for finalizing that requirement overall, are discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b) above.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii), renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(4), with minor modifications for clarity. The final rule requires that, in accordance with final § 1005.18(b)(1), a financial institution shall provide a disclosure setting forth the fees and information listed in final § 1005.18(b)(4)(i) through (vii) for a prepaid account, as applicable. Specific revisions and additions to the enumerated list of fees and information required in the long form disclosure are discussed in the section-by-section analyses of § 1005.18(b)(4)(i) through (vii) below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is finalizing Sample Form A-10(f) rather than providing a specific model long form (which would have provided safe harbor). In light of the variation in long forms that may occur where financial institutions have different fee structures and conditions, the Bureau has also revised the text of the final rule from the proposed version to remove language that would have required the long form to be in substantially similar format to the sample form. The Bureau believes this change will further underscore the fact that financial institutions are afforded discretion in formatting the long form in a way that will best convey the amount and nature of the information that is required to be provided under the rule. Thus, Sample Form A-10(f) is provided as an example that financial institutions may, but are not required to, incorporate or emulate in their own long form disclosures.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>33(a)(1)(iv)(D) </title>
      <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) of the 2012 Final Rule defines as an error a remittance transfer provider's failure to make funds available to the designated recipient by the date of availability stated on the receipt or combined disclosure, subject to three listed exceptions, including an exception for remittance transfers made with fraudulent intent by the sender or a person working in concert with the sender. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C).  Comment 33(a)-5 to the 2012 Final Rule elaborates on the definition of the term “error” under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) and explains that such errors under subpart B of Regulation E include, among other things, the late delivery of funds, the total non-delivery of a remittance transfer, and the delivery of funds to the wrong account. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comments 33(a)-5.1 and .ii.  The commentary further notes that if only a portion of the funds are made available by the disclosed date of availability, then § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) does not apply, but § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) may apply instead.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As explained under comment 33(c)-2 in the 2012 Final Rule, an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) would include situations where a remittance transfer provider failed to make funds in connection with a remittance transfer available to a designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability because the sender provided an incorrect account number to the remittance transfer provider.  After issuance of the 2012 Final Rule, the Bureau received comments from industry that providers often have no means to verify designated recipients' account numbers for remittance transfers into foreign bank accounts.  As a result, providers could have to bear the potentially significant costs of their customers' mistakes in cases in which funds were deposited in the wrong account and could not be recovered as a result of the sender's provision of an incorrect account number.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In the December Proposal, the Bureau proposed to revise the definition of error in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) by adding a fourth, conditional exception.  Proposed § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) would have excluded from the definition of error a failure to make funds available to the designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability, where such failure resulted from the sender having given the remittance transfer provider an incorrect account number, provided that the provider met the conditions set forth in proposed § 1005.33(h).  These proposed conditions, would have required providers to notify senders of the risk that their funds could be lost, to investigate reported errors, and to attempt to recover the missing funds.  In addition, the exception would have been limited to situations in which the funds were actually deposited into the wrong account.  Where these conditions were met, the proposed exception would not have required providers to bear the cost of refunding or resending transfers. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau sought comment on the proposed exception generally and whether it should be limited to mistakes regarding account numbers or expanded to include other incorrect information provided by senders in connection with remittance transfers, such as routing numbers.  Each of these is discussed below. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Exception for Senders' Mistakes Regarding Account Numbers</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters uniformly supported the addition of the proposed exception to the definition of error where the error was caused by the sender's provision of an incorrect account number.  They put forth a number of reasons why they favored the proposed change.  In many respects, these comments expanded upon those received prior to the December Proposal. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters reiterated earlier concerns about the large potential exposure given their general inability of remittance transfer providers to validate the accuracy of a designated recipient's account number provided in connection with a wire transfers and similar types of open network transfers sent to accounts at banks and other institutions abroad.  These commenters argued that providers sending these transfers over open networks generally have limited ability to cross-check account numbers with the names of accountholders prior to sending transfers because they often have no direct relationships with recipient institutions and thus no means of accessing those institutions' account information.  Commenters further stated that as a result, the only way for a provider to validate such numbers may be to contact the recipient institution manually, which may be time-consuming and difficult due to language and time zone issues.  Such validation would necessitate manual handling of remittance transfers and limit the ability of providers to use automated systems, which are less costly than manual handling of each transfer.  Commenters stated their concern that manual validation could substantially increase costs to senders and delay the processing of remittance transfers.  Relatedly, several commenters claimed that it was infeasible to expect providers to develop account number verification systems, automated or otherwise, before the effective date of the 2012 Final Rule (which was scheduled to take effect on February 7, 2013) due to the number of institutions worldwide that would need to adjust their systems used for transmitting wires.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters also reiterated concerns expressed prior to the issuance of the December Proposal regarding the potential for fraud if a sender's provision of an incorrect account number is considered an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv).  As discussed in the December Proposal, commenters had stated that the 2012 Final Rule could enable fraudulent activity to flourish because, if unscrupulous senders provided incorrect account numbers and funds were sent to a coconspirator, remittance transfer providers might have to send transfer amounts again to another coconspirator without first recovering them.  Commenters argued that the fraud exception in the 2012 Final Rule—§ 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C)—is insufficient because for providers to use the exception would be difficult in most circumstances.  Many industry commenters stated that providers in the United States typically have a limited ability to gather evidence of fraud from a recipient institution abroad or to mandate cooperation from foreign institutions with whom they have no direct relationship.  Industry commenters also noted that even if a provider suspected fraud, the lack of evidence would cause providers to hesitate to accuse one of its own customers of fraud.  Industry commenters also stated that the 2012 Final Rule departed from current industry practice by requiring that remittance transfer providers resend or refund a remittance transfer even when a sender's mistake results in mis-delivery of funds that cannot be recovered. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters expressed concern that in light of the significant exposure under the 2012 Final Rule's sender error provisions, if the Bureau did not revise the error resolution procedures as it proposed to do in the December Proposal, many remittance transfer providers would curtail their remittance transfer offerings such as by limiting the amount permitted per transfer, limiting transfers to certain trusted customers, or by exiting the remittance transfer business altogether. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters also argued that the Bureau should not have adopted the approach taken in the 2012 Final Rule to sender error because it was not mandated by statute.  One of these commenters opined that because the Dodd-Frank Act was not specific with respect to who must bear the cost of a mis-directed remittance transfer, the Bureau's legal authority to require remittance transfer providers to bear the cost of mistakes made by senders was questionable. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In contrast to comments from industry, consumer group commenters were divided on whether the Bureau should adopt the proposed exception for certain sender errors.  Two consumer groups supported the proposed change because, they contended, the proposed rule achieved the appropriate allocation of risk between senders and remittance transfer providers and incentivized providers to minimize the occurrence of errors.  These commenters also stated that it would be difficult for providers, particularly small providers, to retrieve funds sent to the wrong account.  They further asserted that it would be difficult for providers, and particularly credit unions, to accuse their customers or members of fraud in order to avail themselves of the fraud exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(C).  As a result, these consumer group commenters argued that absent the proposed revision, many providers might choose to exit the remittance transfer business altogether, resulting in a loss of access to senders. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Other consumer groups opposed the proposed changes and urged the Bureau not to amend the 2012 Final Rule with respect to sender mistakes regarding account numbers that result in the loss of the transfer amount.  First, some of these groups argued that the Bureau would be undermining the intent of Congress, which, they argued, was to motivate industry to change existing practices to develop more secure means of sending remittance transfers.  By adopting the proposed exception, these commenters argued, the Bureau would eliminate any incentive for remittance transfer providers to develop enhanced security procedures.  Relatedly, some consumer groups also argued that the existing definition of error in subpart A of Regulation E, specifically § 1005.11(a)(ii), already addresses the situation in which a consumer provides an incorrect recipient account number by creating an error for “incorrect” electronic fund transfers.<footnote ref="8">Section 1005.11 of subpart A of Regulation E contains error resolution provisions for electronic fund transfers.  Section 1005.11(a)(ii) states that a potential error under the rule is an “incorrect electronic fund transfer to or from the consumer's account.”</footnote>
             These commenters noted that insofar as § 1005.11(a)(ii) is phrased in general terms and refers to an “incorrect electronic fund transfer” by its plain language it does not exclude incorrect information provided by a consumer (or any other party).  Insofar as § 1005.11(a)(ii) has long applied to a portion of remittance transfers, the commenters contended that had Congress intended to deny the protections of this provision to consumers, it would have done so more explicitly. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, some consumer group commenters suggested that the Bureau should not adopt the proposed exception to the definition of error, even if the 2012 Final Rule would result in some remittance transfer providers exiting the market because they are unable to implement adequate verification procedures today.  Alternatively, these commenters suggested that, in order to reduce the risk of market exit, that the Bureau could adopt the proposed revisions, but limit the proposed exception to the definition of error to transfers over a certain dollar amount so that senders of smaller transfers would still benefit from the error provisions in the 2012 Final Rule. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Upon consideration of these comments and further consideration and to facilitate compliance, the Bureau is finalizing § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) with several changes from the proposed provision, which are discussed below.  As in the December Proposal, the exception as finalized will only apply if a remittance transfer provider can meet certain conditions including warnings to senders and use of reasonable validation methods where available.  These conditions are set forth in § 1005.33(h) and also are discussed in detail below.  Where the exception applies, providers will not be required to bear the cost of refunding or resending transfers if funds ultimately cannot be recovered. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As it noted in the December Proposal, the Bureau believes that this exception appropriately allocates risk based on remittance transfer providers' existing methods for sending transfers, which often do not allow for or facilitate verification of designated recipients' account numbers.  The Bureau continues to believe it is important for industry to develop improved security procedures and expects to engage in a dialogue with industry about how to encourage the growth of improved controls and communication mechanisms.  But the Bureau understands that industry is unlikely to be reasonably able to implement such changes in the near future.  Subpart B of Regulation E does not regulate most recipient institutions, and the Bureau has concluded that individual providers, and particularly those sending transfers through open networks have limited ability to influence the practices of financial institutions worldwide in the short term. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Absent such changes, the Bureau is concerned that remittance transfer providers will exit the market or reduce remittance offerings rather than risk having to bear the cost of the entire transfer amount where funds are deposited into the wrong  account due to the sender's provision of an incorrect account number.  The Bureau believes such an interim disruption would not be in consumers' best interests, and thus has finalized the proposed exception as discussed below.  The Bureau, however, will continue to evaluate the development of procedures as it monitors providers' implementation of and compliance with the 2013 Final Rule.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau disagrees with those consumer group commenters that the 2012 Final Rule should be allowed to take effect absent the proposed exception for sender account number mistakes, and that the Bureau should instead monitor whether the concerns summarized in the December Proposal—such as increased fraud and remittance transfer providers exiting the market—actually materialize.  As stated above and in the December Proposal, the Bureau is concerned that absent the proposed change, some providers would severely curtail their offerings or withdraw from the remittance transfer business altogether, and such a market change could have a negative impact on senders.  The Bureau also does not believe, as commenters suggested, that it is appropriate to limit the scope of the exception to larger value transfers, because doing so could potentially encourage providers to limit senders' access to smaller value transfers.  In addition, the Bureau does not believe it appropriate to engage in line drawing or to provide differential protections in this circumstance.  Furthermore, the Bureau disagrees that the proposed exception would harm senders in that the exception in many ways maintains the status quo insofar as the Bureau believes that, today, senders typically bear the loss when their mistake leads to a mis-deposit.  Nor does the Bureau believe that the problem of senders losing the transfer amount is particularly widespread today; insofar as the status quo is maintained, the Bureau does not expect this to change.  The Bureau's outreach confirmed that in most cases where there is a problem in the transmission of a remittance transfer, the provider is able to retrieve the funds or have them routed properly. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With regard to commenters' arguments about the Bureau's statutory authority, the Bureau disagrees both with industry participant and consumer group arguments that the EFTA or section 1073 of the Dodd-Frank Act specifies which party must bear the cost of a sender's mistake with respect to remittance transfer.  Rather, EFTA section 919 gives the Bureau broad discretion to set standards for remittance transfer providers with respect to error resolution, including to define errors, and does not mandate a specific result with regard to which party should bear the risk of loss under any particular circumstances.  Nor does the Bureau believe that the definition of error in subpart A of Regulation E, which does not apply to all remittance transfers, precludes the Bureau from adopting more specifically tailored error resolutions, and corresponding definitions, applicable to all remittance transfers under subpart B of Regulation E. <em data-original="E-03">See also</em> § 1005.33(f).  Accordingly, the Bureau has adopted the proposed exception for sender account number mistakes subject to specific conditions discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Scope of the Sender Error Exception</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As noted above the Bureau also sought comment on the scope of the proposed exception to the definition of error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) and whether it should apply to incorrect information provided by senders in addition to designated recipients' account numbers and, in particular, whether the proposed exception should apply in cases in which senders make mistakes regarding routing numbers or similar institution identifiers in addition to mistakes regarding account numbers. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In response, many industry commenters suggested that the proposed exception be expanded to refer to sender mistakes regarding any information provided by a sender in connection with a remittance transfer rather than just mistaken account numbers, as proposed.  Other commenters listed specific types of incorrect information that should be addressed by the exception to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv), such as:  Routing numbers, Business Identifier Codes (BICs), Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication codes (SWIFT codes), International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs), local bank codes, prepaid, debit or credit card account numbers, recipient institutions' names, designated recipients' names, escrow account numbers, currencies in which transfers will be received, incomplete wire instructions, and recipients' email addresses, phone numbers, and addresses.  Commenters offered different reasons as to why the proposed exception should be expanded to include sender mistakes regarding each suggested type of information.  In addition to considering these comments, the Bureau conducted additional outreach to understand the nature of errors related to the suggested types of information and why remittance transfer providers thought they should be included in any exception to an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) in the 2012 Final Rule. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Many of the industry commenters that urged that the proposed exception should be extended to all mistakes made by senders argued, as noted above, that there is no statutory basis to make remittance transfer providers bear the cost of all senders' mistakes.  Relatedly, one commenter argued that no other consumer finance statute protects consumers from their own errors and that there is a distinction between allocating risk to a provider for mistakes by third parties, or where fault cannot be determined, and requiring providers to bear the cost of senders' mistakes. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As for the specific types of information provided by senders, nearly all industry commenters and some consumer group commenters favored expanding the proposed exception to apply to sender mistakes regarding routing numbers and other recipient institution identifiers.  Commenters explained that for many remittance transfers into accounts, remittance transfer providers request, in addition to the number of the designated recipient's account, an alphanumeric identifier of the recipient institution, similar to the routing numbers used to identify depository institutions in the United States.<footnote ref="9">For example, in order to route a wire transfer to a foreign bank, a bank in the United States may require that the sender provide the name of the designated recipient and the recipient's institution as well as the BIC for the recipient's institution, and the recipient's account number.</footnote>
             Providers, and any other intermediaries involved in the transfer, then use this identifier to determine the institution to which the transfer should be sent.  Commenters further explained that, in many cases, a sender's mistake regarding the identifier of a bank could pose a similar problem for a provider as an incorrect account number.  The commenters stated that, like account numbers, many providers lack the ability to verify the accuracy of alphanumerical identifiers related to recipient institutions that are provided by senders.  If a recipient institution identifier is incorrect and the provider does not match it with an institution name, funds could conceivably be mis-deposited if the institution represented by the incorrect routing number has an account matching the number provided by the sender. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition to sender  mistakes regarding account numbers and recipient institution identifiers, several commenters asked that the Bureau exclude from the definition of error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) senders' mistakes regarding correspondent routing instructions (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> if the sender suggests that the remittance transfer provider send the transfer through a particular correspondent that is unable to complete the transfer).  Several commenters stated that generally this sort of mistake generally would lead to a delay of a transfer and not its mis-deposit into the wrong account. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, several industry commenters argued that the proposed exception should be expanded to apply to senders' mistakes regarding designated recipients' names and information that the designated recipient themselves might need to apply the proceeds of remittance transfers after receipt.  For example, a trade association commenter asked that the Bureau expand the proposed exception to include sender mistakes about additional information a designated recipient needs to process a transfer it receives.  The commenter stated that if, for example, the designated recipient is an insurer, it might need the designated recipient's policy number to process the funds received.  Similarly, one commenter stated that if a designated recipient is a property lessor, the lessor might need an identifying apartment number in order to process a transfer that is a rent payment. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>After careful consideration of the comments received and upon further consideration, the Bureau is expanding the exception to the definition of error in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to include situations where a sender has provided an incorrect recipient institution identifier in addition to situations where a sender provides an incorrect account number, as long as the error results in a mis-deposit of the funds and that the remittance transfer provider meets the conditions set forth in § 1005.33(h).  As discussed below, the 2013 Final Rule includes as one such condition, that the provider use reasonably available means to verify the recipient institution identifier provided by the sender. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(h)(2). </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Based on its monitoring of the remittance market, review of comment letters, and other outreach, the Bureau believes that situations in which an incorrect recipient institution identifier could result in a transfer being deposited into the wrong account are exceedingly rare but not unheard of.  More typically, the Bureau understands, a mistaken identifier will result in a transfer that is returned to the remittance transfer provider because either the identifier does not match any institution or the account number does not match an account at the institution to which the transfer is mistakenly directed.  Nevertheless, the Bureau is expanding the exception in the 2013 Final Rule beyond what was proposed because, upon further consideration, it believes that it is appropriate to treat mistakes in recipient institution identifiers similarly to mistakes in account numbers.  The two types of identifiers are similar in purpose and, in some cases, are combined into one.  In addition, these identifiers may not be easily verifiable by providers sending remittance transfers over an open network and are used in straight-through, automated processing of transfers.  Additionally, although less likely than as with respect to account numbers, under the 2012 Final Rule an unscrupulous sender could potentially provide an incorrect routing number to perpetrate a fraud with a coconspirator abroad. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Contrary to requests by commenters that the Bureau extend the proposed exception for sender mistakes regarding account numbers to mistakes regarding all types of information, the Bureau is limiting the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to sender mistakes regarding account numbers and recipient institution identifiers because it does not believe it is appropriate to extend the exception to all mistakes a sender might make in connection with a remittance transfer for several reasons.  While the chance of mis-deposit is limited for all sender mistakes, the Bureau believes there is a greater risk for mistakes regarding account numbers and recipient institution identifiers.  However, for most other types of sender mistakes identified by commenters, such as mistakes regarding the recipient's address or wire instructions, the Bureau does not believe that the incorrect information would usually result in a mis-deposit of a remittance transfer.  Instead, the Bureau believes that these mistakes will at most result in a delay of delivery or in non-delivery of the remittance transfer.  In situations where the recipient institution identifies a customer with the same name as the designated recipient but is unable to match that customer's name to the provided account number, the Bureau believes that the recipient institution will generally be unable to apply the funds and that the transfer will be returned or otherwise delayed but that the funds will not be mis-deposited. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe that it is warranted to extend the exception to those sender mistakes that are likely to result only in either a delay or a return of the transfer to the remittance transfer provider, and not the loss of funds, because the cost to the provider of delay or non-delivery differs markedly from the cost of lost transfers.  Under the 2012 Final Rule, when a transfer is delayed or returned to the provider, the provider must refund its fee to the sender. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii).  Additionally, when the transfer is returned to the provider, the sender can request that the transfer be resent at no charge (although third-party fees may be imposed on the resend) or have the transfer amount refunded. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii).  The cost to the provider in these circumstances differs markedly from the cost to the provider under the 2012 Final Rule for a transfer that is mis-deposited into the wrong account and cannot be retrieved.  When a mis-deposit occurs, absent an exception, the provider may have to resend or refund the entire transfer amount if the transfer could not be retrieved from the wrong account rather than merely refund its fee or send a transfer at no cost. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii) and comment 33(c)-2 in the 2012 Final Rule.  Thus, for mis-deposited transfers, the fact that the provider is potentially at risk of having to absorb a loss of principal is far higher than for other types of errors and thus is far more likely to lead to a significant curtailment of services.  Furthermore, the Bureau believes that, in many respects, the remedy under the 2012 Final Rule for non-delivery is similar to many providers' existing practices in that they now resend funds at no charge with the corrected information.  Therefore, to maintain as an error sender mistakes that merely result in delay or non-delivery of the remittance transfer as part of this final rule would not require a significant adjustment for those providers.  Finally, the 2012 Final Rule already allows providers a mechanism to manage uncertainty regarding the date of delivery of funds. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) and comment 32(b)(2)-1 (interpreting § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) to allow a provider to disclose the “latest date on which funds will be available”).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters suggested that the Bureau should make senders, rather than providers, bear the costs of their own mistakes because no other consumer protection regimes makes the regulated entities bear the costs of consumers' mistakes.  The Bureau does not think it is necessary or appropriate that the remittances rules' remedy provisions match perfectly those in other consumer protection regimes, given the unique statutory structure and nature of the transactions at issue.  The Bureau is maintaining the 2012 Final Rule's error provisions regarding sender mistakes other than those covered by the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D), because it believes providers are generally in the best position to institute systems to limit their occurrence and to work with other industry participants to resolve particular mistakes in transmissions. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to those mistakes that are likely to result only in a delay or non-delivery of a remittance transfer (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> mistakes other than those regarding account number or the recipient institution identifier), the Bureau believes that retaining the current rule, which does not include an exception for such mistakes, strikes the appropriate balance been protecting senders and encouraging providers to limit the incidence of such errors without exposing providers to the risk of loss of the transfer amount.  With respect to those sender mistakes that make it impossible for the recipient (as opposed to the recipient institution) to know how to use the funds received (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> an apartment number to apply a rent payment), the Bureau does not believe that such mistakes would give rise to an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv).  This is true because the 2013 Final Rule only does not define as an error the inability of the designated recipient to timely apply the funds for a particular purpose once a transfer is received. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also does not believe that a sender's provision of an incorrect name would result in an error under the 2013 Final Rule, and thus a sender's provision of an incorrect name need not be included in the exception from the term error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D).  As defined under § 1005.30(c), a designated recipient is “any person specified by the sender as the authorized recipient of a remittance transfer to be received at a foreign country.”  As noted above, comment 30(c)-1 in the 2012 Final Rule stated that a designated recipient can be either a natural person or an organization, such as a corporation.  The Bureau is further clarifying this comment in the 2013 Final Rule to explain that the designated recipient is identified by the name of the person provided by the sender to the remittance transfer provider and disclosed by the provider to the sender pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(iii). <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 30(c)-1.  Thus, assume for example that a sender tells a remittance transfer provider to send a transfer to “Jane Doe” at a foreign bank, the provider discloses “Jane Doe” pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(2)(iii), and the transfer is timely deposited by that bank into Jane Doe's account.  If the sender later asserts that an error occurred because the sender in fact intended the transfer to be sent to “John Doe” but had not communicated that to the provider, no error has occurred under the final rule because “Jane Doe” was the name of the designated recipient stated on the receipt provided to the sender. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In some cases, however, a sender's name can result in an error.  If, for example, the recipient institution could not deliver the remittance transfer described above because no one named “Jane Doe” had an account at the recipient institution, or more than one person named “Jane Doe” had an account at that institution such that the funds could not be applied, the transfer would be delayed or rejected resulting in an error because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information.  Insofar as this would not lead to the deposit of the transfer in the wrong account, the Bureau is not inclined to include these mistakes in the exception. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Commenters also urged the Bureau to include in the exception to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) to mistakes regarding mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and debit, credit and prepaid card numbers, arguing that these additional categories of identifiers warrant the same treatment as those covered by proposed § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D).  Commenters supporting expansion of the exception to include these identifiers generally put forth the same reasons as those discussed above regarding account numbers and recipient institution identifiers.  These commenters generally did not address the practical differences between transfers sent between bank accounts and those sent to other types of accounts. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not think it appropriate to extend the exception to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to these sorts of identifiers for several reasons.  First, § 1005.31(b)(2)(iii) requires that a remittance transfer provider disclose the name of the designated recipient to the sender and comment 30(c)-1 now clarifies that the designated recipient is identified by the name of the person stated on the disclosure provided pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(iii) regardless of what other identifying information that the sender may also have provided to the provider.  Insofar as a provider must disclose the name of the designated recipient on the receipt provided to the sender, the provider is not permitted to process a remittance transfer under the 2013 Final Rule by only disclosing a non-name identifier, such as a card number, email address, or mobile number.  To the extent providers currently send transfers without disclosing a name to the sender, they will not be able to continue doing so once the 2013 Final Rule takes effect. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Second, the Bureau believes that in the current market, only a small number of providers send remittance transfers to designated recipients who are identified by mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and debit, credit and prepaid card numbers.  These providers are often conducting transfers between two of their own customers through a closed network, and thus are in position to verify designated recipients' identities.  In other words, for transfers conducted through these closed-networks, both the sender and recipient will have agreed to sign on to the provider's network in order to send or receive funds.  The Bureau understands that, today, a number of the providers using these identifiers may not verify that the identifier matches the name of the designated recipient in every instance.  However, the Bureau believes that unlike providers using account numbers to identify designated recipients in transfers through the open network system, these providers have a reasonable ability to implement security measures in order to limit the possibility that senders make mistakes regarding designated recipients' mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and debit, credit and prepaid card numbers.  These measures might include confirmation codes, test transactions, or other methods to prevent transfers from being sent to the wrong person. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Third, the Bureau believes that the systems are still limited and nascent for transfers in which the mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and debit, credit and prepaid card numbers are used to identify designated recipients and the transfer is not sent entirely over the remittance transfer provider's own network.  As these systems grow, the Bureau expects that providers can proactively design systems in such a way as to allow for the development of better verification protocols.  If, in the future, providers intend to develop new systems to allow transfers using only names and mobile phone numbers to identify designated recipients, for example, the Bureau believes that such systems should be designed to verify that the provided names and numbers match before recipients can receive transfers.  The Bureau does not believe that such methods can be implemented for most transfers sent to bank accounts.  As described above, such transfers are generally sent as wire transfers, through an open network system. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As noted, the Bureau has limited the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to account numbers and recipient institution identifiers in order to encourage the growth of improved controls and communication mechanisms that may generally limit the possibility of other errors in the transmission of remittance transfers.  Furthermore, the Bureau intends to monitor closely industry's ability to verify account numbers and recipient institution identifiers and will consider modifying this exception if it thinks such verification methods become reasonably available and are able to prevent most errors from occurring. </analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(b)(4)(iii) Statement Regarding Registration and FDIC or NCUA Insurance</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii)(D) would have required that the long form also include the disclosure required in the short form under proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">13</em>) regarding FDIC (or NCUSIF) pass-through deposit (or share) insurance, when appropriate.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received one comment regarding the disclosure of FDIC or NCUSIF insurance in the long form. A consumer group recommended that, in addition to requiring disclosure of the statement regarding insurance eligibility required in the short form (<em data-original="E-03">see</em> final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xi)), the Bureau require disclosure of additional information about the benefit of the insurance or the consequence of the lack of such coverage in a separate box for important notices. The consumer group also recommended specific language for such a notice.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As noted above, one consumer group also requested that the Bureau consider adding additional information to the registration and insurance disclosure in the short form, such as an explanation of what protections in addition to insurance eligibility registration provides or more fulsome information about the implications of insurance coverage. As discussed in connection with § 1005.18(b)(2)(xi), the Bureau is declining to add any more information to the registration/insurance disclosure in the short form disclosure, but has concluded that it would be useful to require financial institutions to provide more detailed information about insurance coverage in the long form disclosure. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> final § 1005.18(b)(4)(iii).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Thus, for the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is finalizing proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii)(D), renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(4)(iii), with substantial modifications. Specifically, the Bureau is requiring a more fulsome disclosure regarding insurance, as well as the statement directing the consumer to register the account, where applicable. The Bureau has made other technical modifications to the rule for conformity and clarity.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Unlike the proposal, final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xi) requires that financial institutions disclose a statement regarding eligibility for FDIC deposit insurance or NCUA share insurance, as appropriate, rather than just a statement in situations where the prepaid account was not eligible for insurance. Final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xi) also requires that the statement direct the consumer to register the prepaid account for insurance and other account protections, where applicable, which had been a separate provision in the proposal. In addition, final § 1005.18(b)(4)(iii) requires an explanation of FDIC or NCUA insurance coverage and the benefit of such coverage or the consequence of the lack of such coverage, as applicable. New comment 18(b)(4)(iii)-1 provides examples illustrating how this disclosure might be made for FDIC and NCUA insurance in certain circumstances, and cross-references final comment 18(b)(2)(xi)-1 for guidance as to when NCUA insurance coverage should be disclosed instead of FDIC insurance coverage.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(2)(xi), the Bureau is persuaded by commenters, the results of its post-proposal consumer testing, and information received during the interagency consultation process that the registration and insurance disclosures should be combined, and that both the existence as well as the lack of insurance eligibility should be disclosed. The Bureau also believes that mirroring the § 1005.18(b)(2)(xi) disclosure in the long form will assist consumers in comparison shopping and reinforce the need to register prepaid accounts, where applicable.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, while the Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing confirmed that some consumers erroneously equate FDIC coverage with fraud or theft protection, a number of participants understood that the insurance protects consumers' funds in the case of bank insolvency.<footnote ref="454">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report II at 15 and 26. In the first round of post-proposal testing, two out of nine participants understood that FDIC insurance is meant to protect their money in case of a bank failure; in the second round, approximately half of the 11 participants understood this.</footnote>
             Absent the space limitations of the short form disclosure, the Bureau believes the long form disclosure provides an optimal opportunity to briefly, but more fully, explain the implications of insurance coverage or lack thereof. The Bureau does not believe it necessary to prescribe the exact content of this disclosure because circumstances may vary for a particular prepaid account program; thus, the final rule requires only that the long form include (in addition to the statement required in the short form pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xi)) an explanation of FDIC or NCUA insurance coverage and the benefit of such coverage or the consequence of the lack of such coverage, as applicable.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As noted above in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(2)(xi), the final rule refers to NCUA, rather than NCUSIF, insurance for credit unions. After further consideration and based on information received during the interagency consultation process, the Bureau believes the term “NCUA” may be more meaningful to consumers than “NCUSIF” and has revised the disclosures accordingly in both final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xi) and (4)(iii).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(b)(4)(ii) Fees</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii)(A) would have required the financial institution to disclose in the long form all fees that may be imposed by the financial institution in connection with a prepaid account. For each fee type, the financial institution would have had to disclose the amount of the fee and the conditions, if any, under which the fee may be imposed, waived, or reduced. This would include, to the extent known, any third-party fee amounts that may apply. Proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii)(A) would also have required that if such third-party fees may apply but the amount of those fees are not known, a financial institution would have had to instead include a statement indicating that third-party fees may apply without specifying the fee amount. Under the proposal, a fee imposed by a third party that acts as an agent of the financial institution for purposes of the prepaid account always would have had to be disclosed.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii)(A) would have also stated that a financial institution may not utilize any symbols, such as asterisks, to explain the conditions under which any fee may be imposed. The Bureau believed it is important that consumers be able to easily follow the information in the long form, and that, when financial institutions do not face space constraints like on the short form, text should be used to explain any information about fees, instead of relying on a consumer first to notice symbols and then associate them with text in a footnote.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also proposed to add commentary to explain the format of the long form disclosure. Specifically, proposed comment 18(b)(2)(ii)(A)-1 would have explained that, for example, if a financial institution charges a cash reload fee, the financial institution must list the amount of the cash reload fee and also specify any circumstances under which a consumer can qualify for a lower fee. The proposed comment would have further explained that relevant conditions to disclose could also include, for example, if there is a limit on the amount of cash a consumer may load into the prepaid account in a transaction or during a particular time period.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(ii)(A)-2 would have explained that a financial institution may, at its option, choose to disclose pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii)(A), any service or feature it provides or offers even if it does not charge a fee for that service or feature. The proposed comment would have clarified that, for example, a financial institution may choose to list “online bill pay service” and indicate that the fee is “$0” or “free” when the financial institution does not charge consumers a fee for that service or feature. By contrast, where a service or feature is available without a fee for an introductory period, but where a fee may be imposed at the conclusion of the introductory period for that service or feature, the financial institution could not indicate that the fee is “$0.” The proposed comment would have clarified that the financial institution should instead list the main fee and explain in the separate explanatory column how the fee could be lower during the introductory period, what that alternative fee would be, and when it will be imposed. Similarly, if a consumer must enroll in an additional service to avoid incurring a fee for another service, neither of those services should disclose a fee of “$0,” but should instead list each fee amount imposed if a consumer does not enroll. The proposed comment also would have provided an example that if the monthly fee is waived once a consumer receives direct deposit payments into the prepaid account, the monthly fee imposed upon a consumer if they do not receive direct deposit would be disclosed in the long form, and an explanation regarding how receiving direct deposit might lower the fee should be included in the explanatory column in the long form.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(ii)(A)-3 would have provided guidance on the disclosure of third-party fees in the long form disclosure. Specifically, the proposed comment would have explained that, for example, a financial institution that offers balance updates to a consumer via text message would disclose that mobile carrier data charges may apply for each text message a consumer receives. Regarding the requirement in proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii)(A), a financial institution must always disclose in the long form any fees imposed by a third party who is acting as an agent of the financial institution for purposes of the prepaid account product, the proposed comment would have provided an example that any fees that the provider of a cash reload service who has a relationship with the financial institution may impose would have had to be disclosed in the long form.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>In the context of recommending against requiring the long form disclosure altogether, a number of industry commenters—including an industry trade association, program managers, and issuing banks—asserted that the amount and complexity of the information proposed to be included in the long form disclosure would overwhelm consumers. See the section-by-section analysis § 1005.18(b) above for discussion of such comments and the Bureau's reasoning for finalizing the overall requirement to disclose the long form.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With regard to recommendations for the specific content of the long form disclosure, two issuing banks requested that the Bureau limit the proposed requirement to disclose on the long form all fees that may be imposed in connection with a prepaid account by eliminating disclosure of optional, incidental services. The commenters said such features generally are not available at the time of purchase and are disclosed in a prepaid account program's terms and conditions at the time the consumer elects such services. The commenter asserted that mandating disclosure of fees connected with such services would add complexity to the long form disclosure and discourage financial institutions from creating new features and enhanced functionality due to the burden of having to update the disclosure and distribute new packaging.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Two consumer group commenters and individual consumers who submitted comments as part of a comment submission campaign organized by a national consumer advocacy group generally supported the long form disclosures' proposed scope and urged the Bureau to add additional content requirements, such as disclosure of when funds become available after consumer deposits via ATM, teller, and remote deposit capture; free ways to get cash such as cash back at point of sale when making a purchase; and the number of surcharge-free ATM withdrawals available to the consumer. One consumer group commenter suggested that the Bureau's proposed sample long form disclosure was ambiguous in certain places regarding fees disclosure, particularly with respect to payroll card account fees.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>An industry trade association recommended that free services and features be disclosed as “$0” in the long form instead of the two options in proposed comment 18(b)(2)(ii)(A)-2 of “$0” or “free.”</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters, including trade associations, issuing banks, program managers, and a payment network recommended eliminating the requirement to disclose third-party fees in the long form disclosure. They said it is not practical to disclose third-party fees because the amount, timing, and frequency of such fees are outside of the control of the financial institution and because any changes in such fees would require updates to the long form disclosure and change-in-fee notices. Some industry commenters urged the Bureau to require instead a general disclosure that third-party fees may apply or a more specific disclosure that third-party fees apply with information on how to obtain the specific fee information. A consumer group supported the disclosure of third-party fees in the long form as a method of creating a fair comparison among financial institutions that use third parties to load cash into prepaid accounts and those with proprietary cash reload systems.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii)(A), renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii), with certain modifications. Most significantly, as explained below, the final rule contains several additional accommodations regarding disclosure of third-party fees in the long form. The Bureau is also adopting proposed comments 18(b)(2)(ii)(A)-1 through -4, renumbered as 18(b)(4)(ii)-1 through -4, with certain revisions as discussed below. Finally, the Bureau has made technical modifications to the rule and commentary for conformity and clarity.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting this provision pursuant to its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c), and 905(a), and section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Bureau believes that pre-acquisition disclosures of all fees for prepaid accounts will, consistent with EFTA section 902 and section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, assist consumers' understanding of the terms and conditions of their prepaid accounts, and ensure that the features of prepaid accounts are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the account. The Bureau also believes that the long form disclosure will, in many ways, be similar to what many financial institutions currently disclose regarding prepaid accounts' fee structures in their prepaid account agreements, although pursuant to final § 1005.18(b) the long form disclosure will be provided to consumers as a stand-alone document before they acquire a prepaid account (unless the exception in final § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii) or (iii) applies).<footnote ref="453">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; also final § 1005.18(f)(1) regarding requirements for initial disclosures.</footnote>

        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Disclosure of all fees and conditions and disclosure of features without a charge.</em> Final § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) requires disclosure in the long form of all fees that may be imposed in connection with a prepaid account, including fees that may be imposed by a third party, if known by the financial institution. The Bureau is finalizing as proposed the requirement that the financial institution disclose the amount of each fee and the conditions, if any, under which the fee may be imposed, waived, or reduced. The final rule also requires that a financial institution may not use any symbols, such as an asterisk, to explain conditions under which any fee may be imposed. The final rule further states that a financial institution may, but is not required to, include in the long form disclosure any service or feature it provides or offers at no charge to the consumer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, some industry commenters urged the Bureau not to require disclosure of <em data-original="E-03">all</em> fees on the long form. The Bureau believes that this requirement is necessary to help consumers understand, both prior to and after purchase, the terms and conditions of their prepaid accounts and ensure that account features are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed in a manner that permits consumer understanding of the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the prepaid account. Furthermore, because the short form discloses a limited number of fees and few conditions, this requirement is necessary so that the long form disclosure can provide the full amount of information unabridged.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b) above, the Bureau believes there should be a comprehensive disclosure to which a consumer can turn prior to purchasing a prepaid account for straightforward information on all fees and the circumstances under which they may be imposed. The Bureau is not requiring disclosure in the long form of additional information related to fees as requested by some commenters because the Bureau believes disclosing fee amounts and the conditions under which they may be imposed provides consumers with the most important information they need to have access to pre-acquisition. The Bureau has observed that many financial institutions include details in their account agreements' fee schedules about free services, and the Bureau encourages financial institutions to continue to do so. To provide support to the proposed commentary regarding how to disclose free services and features, the Bureau has added to the regulatory text a sentence stating that a financial institution may, but is not required to, include in the long form disclosure any service or feature it provides or offers at no charge to the consumer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>While the Bureau is generally permitting formatting flexibility on the long form disclosure, the Bureau also is adopting the prohibition in the proposed rule against using any symbol, such as an asterisk, to explain the conditions in the long form disclosure under which any fee may be imposed. The Bureau continues to believe that it is important that consumers can easily follow the information in the long form disclosure and, absent the space constraints of the short form disclosure, the financial institution is able to explain any information about fees directly instead of relying on consumers to notice symbols and then associate them with explanatory text.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Regarding the consumer group's comment that the Bureau's proposed sample long form disclosure was ambiguous in certain places regarding fees disclosure, particularly with respect to payroll card account fees, the Bureau notes that the sample long form is meant to provide an example to aid financial institutions in complying with the requirements of final § 1005.18(b)(4). Financial institutions, including those offering payroll card accounts, should ensure that their long form disclosures accurately reflect the fees and features of their prepaid accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Final comment 18(b)(4)(ii)-1 explains that the requirement in final § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) that a financial institution disclose in the long form all fees that may be imposed in connection with a prepaid account and is not limited to just fees for EFTs or the right to make transfers. It further explains that the requirement to disclose all fees in the long form includes any finance charges imposed on the prepaid account as described in Regulation Z § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in § 1026.61 but does not include finance charges imposed on the covered separate credit feature as described in § 1026.4(b)(11)(i). The comment cross-references comment 18(b)(7)(i)(B)-2 for guidance on disclosure of finance charges as part of the § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) fee disclosure in the long form. The comment also clarifies that a financial institution may also be required to include finance charges in the Regulation Z disclosures required pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(4)(vii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Final comment 18(b)(4)(ii)-2 elaborates on the disclosure of conditions in the long form. The comment provides several examples illustrating how a financial institution would disclose the amount of each fee and the conditions, if any, under which the fee may be imposed, waived, or reduced. The comment also clarifies that a financial institution may, but is not required to, include on the long form disclosure additional information or limitations related to the service or feature for which a fee is charged, such as, for cash reloads, any limit on the amount of cash a consumer may load into the prepaid account in a single transaction or during a particular time period. Finally, the comment clarifies that the general requirement in final § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) does not apply to individual fee waivers or reductions granted to a particular consumer or group of consumers on a discretionary or case-by-case basis.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Final comment 18(b)(4)(ii)-3 addresses disclosure of a service or feature without a charge. It reiterates the provision in the rule that a financial institution may, but is not required to, list in the long form disclosure any service or feature it provides or offers at no charge to the consumer. For example, a financial institution may list “online bill pay” in its long form disclosure and indicate a fee amount of “$0” when the financial institution does not charge consumers a fee for that feature. The Bureau agrees that such services should be disclosed as $0, rather than “free,” as requested by one industry commenter, because having a single standardized approach is shorter, simpler, and clearer for consumers to use to compare fees across prepaid accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 18(b)(4)(ii)-3 further explains, however, that where a fee is waived or reduced under certain circumstances or where a service or feature is available for an introductory period without a fee, the financial institution may not list the fee amount as “$0” or “free.” Rather, the financial institution must list the highest fee, accompanied by an explanation of the waived or reduced fee amount and any conditions for the waiver or discount. The comment also provides several examples.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b) above, the Bureau does not believe that financial institutions change the fee schedules for prepaid accounts often, particularly for those sold at retail locations, and changes may require pulling and replacing or providing appropriate change-in-terms notices.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>If a financial institution is making available a new optional service for all prepaid accounts in a particular prepaid account program, a financial institution may provide new customers disclosures in accordance with § 1005.7(c) post-acquisition, without needing to pull and replace card packaging that does not reflect that new optional feature in any disclosure contained inside the package in accordance with §§ 1005.7 and 1005.18(b)(1)(ii)(C), (b)(4)(ii), and (f)(1). The Bureau intends to monitor financial institutions' practices in this area, however, and may consider additional requirements in a future rulemaking if necessary.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Disclosure of third-party fees.</em> With regard to disclosure of third-party fees in the long form, the Bureau is finalizing the general proposed requirement that financial institutions disclose in the long form any third-party fee amounts known to the financial institution that may apply, but making changes regarding the wording and updating of the disclosure to address commenter concerns.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Specifically, the final rule provides that for any such third-party fee disclosed, the financial institution may, but is not required to, include a statement that the fee is accurate as of or through a specific date, a statement that the third-party fee is subject to change, or both statements. As in the proposal, if a third-party fee may apply but the amount of that fee is not known by the financial institution, the final rule requires that the long form disclosure include a statement indicating that the third-party fee may apply without specifying the fee amount.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau moved language clarifying disclosure of fees by a party acting on behalf of the financial institution from the proposed regulatory text to the commentary in the final rule. Specifically, comment 18(b)(4)(ii)-4 clarifies that fees imposed by another party, such as a program manager, for services performed on behalf of the financial institution are not third-party fees and therefore must be disclosed on the long form pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The final rule also provides that a financial institution is not required to revise the long form disclosure required by § 1005.18(b)(4) to reflect a fee change by a third party until such time that the financial institution manufactures, prints, or otherwise produces new prepaid account packaging materials or otherwise updates the long form disclosure. Thus, whether for a prepaid account program with packaging material or for one with only online or oral disclosures, the financial institution must update the long form to disclose a third-party fee change when it otherwise updates its long form disclosure. Final comment 18(b)(4)(ii)-4 provides an example illustrating a disclosure on the long form of a third-party fee when that fee is known to a financial institution and an example of when it is not.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(3) above, the comprehensive design of the long form disclosure is better suited to inform consumers about the details of fee variations and third-party fees than the short form disclosure for which, due to its abridged nature, the final rule disallows disclosure of most third-party fees. Indeed, the Bureau believes that the comprehensiveness of the long form disclosure would be compromised by the exclusion of third-party fees, which would result in consumers not being made aware of all fees they could incur in connection with the prepaid account. The Bureau believes the final rule strikes an appropriate balance by requiring disclosure in the long form of third-party fees but providing, among other things, a safe harbor regarding reprinting or otherwise updating the long form disclosure when a third-party fee changes and a general statement for situations in which a financial institution does not know the amount of the third-party fee.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Disclosing the date as of or through which a third-party fee is accurate, the fact that the third-party fee is subject to change, or both provides flexibility to alert consumers to the limitations of the financial institution's knowledge about third-party fees. The Bureau also believes that it reduces the need to require instantaneous updates as third-party fees shift. Regarding the safe harbor for reprinting due to third-party fee changes, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to require updates of these third-party fees when the financial institution prints new packaging materials or, if there are no packaging materials, when the financial institution otherwise updates the long form disclosure.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) would have required that the fee amounts disclosed by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) through (<em data-original="E-03">4</em>) be more prominent than the other parts of the disclosure required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) and appear in a minimum 11-point font or the corresponding pixel size.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau believed that consumers commonly incur these top-line fees when a financial institution imposes charges for these services. In the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing, participants reported that these fee disclosures were the most important to them.<footnote ref="462">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report I at i.</footnote>
             The Bureau recognized that a financial institution may not charge all of the fees identified in proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) through (<em data-original="E-03">4</em>). For example, a financial institution might not charge any per purchase fees when it imposes a monthly fee. The Bureau, however, still believed that such fees should be disclosed in a more prominent and larger font size than other information on the short form disclosure in order to draw consumers' attention to this information before acquiring a prepaid account. The Bureau also proposed that pixel sizes used correspond to the font sizes specified because font sizes can vary when applied in electronic contexts. Though the font sizes may differ, the Bureau explained that the relative sizes of the components of the short form would have to remain consistent to maintain the visual hierarchy of information included in the form.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Additionally, the Bureau proposed in § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) that the disclosures required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">5</em>) through (<em data-original="E-03">9</em>) (namely, the ATM balance inquiry fees, inactivity fee, and incidence-based fees) must appear in a minimum eight-point font or the corresponding pixel size and appear in no larger a font than what is used for the information required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) through (<em data-original="E-03">4</em>). As discussed in the recap of the proposal above, the Bureau believed that, while these other fees are important for a consumer to know pre-acquisition, the Bureau believed that these fees are less likely to drive most consumers' acquisition decisions when shopping among prepaid accounts and thus should be disclosed using a smaller font size.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) also would have required that the disclosures required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">10</em>) through (<em data-original="E-03">14</em>) appear in a minimum seven-point font or the corresponding pixel size and appear in no larger a font than what is used for the information required to be disclosed by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">5</em>) through (<em data-original="E-03">9</em>) (that is, the ATM balance inquiry fees, customer service fee, inactivity fee, incidence-based fees, and the statement regarding overdraft services and other credit features). Additionally, the statement disclosed pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">10</em>), and the telephone number and Web site URL disclosed pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">11</em>) would have had to be more prominent than the information disclosed pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">12</em>) through (<em data-original="E-03">14</em>) and (b)(2)(i)(C).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) would have also stated that text used to distinguish each of the two fees that would have been required to be disclosed by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), (<em data-original="E-03">3</em>) and (<em data-original="E-03">5</em>), or to explain the duration of inactivity that triggers a financial institution to impose an inactivity fee as required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">7</em>) must appear in a minimum six-point font or the corresponding pixel size and appear in no larger a font than what is used for information required to be disclosed by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">9</em>) through (<em data-original="E-03">12</em>). The Bureau believed that this descriptive information was less important than the actual fee information and therefore should be in a smaller font or pixel size.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive any comments specifically regarding the prominence and size requirements in proposed § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>).</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, and in the absence of comments opposing the specific prominence and size requirements for the fees and other information in the short form disclosure, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(7)(ii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>), as proposed with certain modifications. The Bureau is adopting the actual size requirements as proposed, with the addition of size requirements that were unspecified in the proposed rule. The Bureau has also replaced the proposed requirement that certain portions of the short form disclosure be more prominent with the more specific requirement that such disclosures appear in bold-faced type to clarify that other methods of illustrating prominence, such as italicized type, would not be deemed compliant. Finally, the Bureau has made technical modifications to the rule for conformity and clarity.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As stated in the proposal and above, the top line of the short form disclosure uses prominence and relative type size to highlight what the Bureau's research indicates are the fees that are most important to consumers when selecting a prepaid account. Thus, the final rule requires that the information required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (iv) appear as follows: Fee amounts in bold-faced type; single fee amounts in a minimum type size of 15 points (or 21 pixels); two-tier fee amounts for ATM withdrawal in a minimum type size of 11 points (or 16 pixels) and in no larger a type size than what is used for the single fee amounts; and fee headings in a minimum type size of eight points (or 11 pixels) and in no larger a type size than what is used for the single fee amounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Echoing the proposed rule, the next rung of the visual hierarchy for the short form disclosure includes the remaining fees and the statements regarding additional fee types. The Bureau continues to believe that this information, while important, is not as crucial as the top-line information in driving consumer acquisition decisions and, thus, merits disclosure in a relatively smaller type size. Thus, the final rule requires that the information required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(v) through (ix) appear in a minimum type size of eight points (or 11 pixels) and appear in the same or a smaller type size than what is used for the fee headings required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (iv).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As in the proposed rule, the final rung of the visual hierarchy for the short form disclosure includes the statements required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(x) through (xiii). The Bureau believes that this information, while important, is secondary to the fee information provided in larger type above the statements. Thus, the final rule requires that the information required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(x) through (xiii) appear in a minimum type size of seven points (or nine pixels) and appear in no larger a type size than what is used for the information required to be disclosed by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(v) through (ix).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>While the proposal would have required that certain disclosures in the short form be more prominent than other parts of the disclosure, the final rule specifies that those disclosures appear in bold-faced type. The Bureau believes that the statement regarding the number of additional fee types should be in bold-faced type to alert consumers that the short form does not disclose all fee types that the consumer may incur using that particular prepaid account and to inform them of the total number of additional fee types that could be charged. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii) above, in the Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing, participants expressed interest in knowing more about these fee types.<footnote ref="463">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report II at 11.</footnote>
             Relatedly, the Bureau believes it is important to direct consumers to the source from which consumers can learn about these additional fee types and other information about the prepaid account program. The Bureau believes that standardized and consistent use of bold-faced type for elements the Bureau believes merit greater prominence supports the overall goal of the short form disclosure to provide consumers with clear and easy-to-read information that will enhance their prepaid account purchase and use decisions. Therefore, the final rule requires that the statements disclosed pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) and (x) and the telephone number and Web site URL disclosed pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiii), where applicable, must appear in bold-faced type. For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(2)(x) above, the Bureau believes the statement regarding the availability of an overdraft credit feature must stand out to consumers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, the final rule sets forth the smallest type size requirements for the remaining elements of the short form disclosure, which provide the details of certain fees. The final rule requires that text used to distinguish each of the two-tier fees pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(iii), (v), (vi), and (ix), to explain that the fee required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(vi) applies “per call,” where applicable, or to explain the conditions that trigger an inactivity fee and that the fee applies monthly, or for the applicable time period, pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(vii) appear in a minimum type size of six points (or eight pixels) and appear in no larger a type size than what is used for the information required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(x) through (xiii).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>33(c) Time Limits and Extent of Investigation</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed § 205.33(c) to implement the statutory time frame for investigating errors and set forth the procedures for resolving an error, including the applicable remedies. The Bureau is adopting proposed § 205.33(c) in renumbered § 1005.33(c) with the changes discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>33(c)(1) Time Limits for Investigation and Report to Consumer of Error</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Consistent with EFTA section 919(d)(1)(B), proposed § 205.33(c)(1) provided that a remittance transfer provider must promptly investigate a notice of error to determine whether an error occurred within 90 days of receiving the sender's notice. Some industry commenters suggested that the time to investigate a notice of error should be extended. One industry trade association commenter stated that for one of its member banks, while international wire “exceptions” (including non-timely delivery) averaged less than 1% of its international wire transfers, more than 15% of these exceptions took longer than 90 days to resolve.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that the 90-day time period is set by the statute. Furthermore, compared to the time period to resolve errors for EFTs (including those a consumer may have initiated abroad), which can be either 10 business days or 45 calendar days, 90 days is twice the length of the longest allowable time period. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.11(c). Although a longer period than the one available for EFTs may be justified given the international nature of these transactions, the Bureau believes that senders should have errors resolved in a timely manner. Consequently, the Bureau does not believe use of its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to extend the statutorily-imposed 90-day period is warranted.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>To effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Board also proposed to include in proposed § 205.33(c)(1) a requirement that the remittance transfer provider report the results to the sender within three business days after completing its investigation. As the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, this timing is consistent with the time frame for reporting the results of an error investigation under Regulation E, § 1005.11(c)(2)(iv). In addition, under proposed § 205.33(c)(1), the report or notice of results would have to alert the sender of any remedies available for correcting any error that the provider determines has occurred.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(d)(1) does not expressly require a notice to be provided to the sender when the provider determines that an error has occurred. However, the Board proposed to require that a notice be given in these circumstances to alert the sender of the results of the investigation, as well as to inform the sender of available remedies. In proposing this requirement, the Board did not propose that the notice to a sender that an error occurred as asserted had to be in writing because such a requirement could unnecessarily delay a sender's ability to receive an appropriate remedy. Accordingly, the Board proposed comment 33(c)-1 to clarify that if the error occurred as described by the sender, the provider may inform the sender of its findings either orally or in writing. If the error did not occur as described, however, the remittance transfer provider would have to provide a written notice of its findings under § 1005.33(d), as discussed below. The Bureau agrees with the Board's reasoning in proposing both § 205.33(c)(1) and comment 33(c)-1. Accordingly, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to adopt these provisions substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(c)(1) and comment 33(c)-1, respectively.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters also requested that the Bureau specify that the burden of proof should be on the remittance transfer provider so that if a sender presents evidence that there has been an error, the burden should unequivocally shift to the remittance transfer provider to show that there was not an error. The Bureau notes that the EFTA establishes various burdens of proof. For example, under EFTA section 909(b), in any action involving a consumer's liability for an unauthorized EFT, the burden of proof is upon the financial institution to show that the EFT was authorized. However, under EFTA section 910(b), a financial institution is not liable for an incorrect or delayed EFT if it can show by a preponderance of the evidence that its action or failure to act resulted from an act of God or other circumstance beyond its control or a technical malfunction known to the consumer at the time the consumer attempted to initiate the EFT. Section 1073 of the Dodd-Frank Act did not amend the EFTA to adopt a specific burden of proof for errors related to remittance transfers that are not EFTs. Therefore, the Bureau does not believe it is appropriate to address this issue.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>33(c)(2) Remedies</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed § 205.33(c)(2) to establish the procedures and remedies for correcting an error. Proposed § 205.33(c)(2)(i) and (ii) included the two remedies that are specified in EFTA section 919(d)(1)(B). Under proposed § 205.33(c)(2), the sender may designate the preferred remedy in the event of an error, consistent with EFTA section 919(d)(1)(B). Thus, under proposed § 205.33(c)(2)(i), the sender could choose to obtain a refund of the amount tendered in connection with the remittance transfer that was not properly transmitted, or an amount appropriate to resolve the error. Alternatively, under proposed § 205.33(c)(2)(ii), the sender could choose to have the remittance transfer provider send to the designated recipient the amount appropriate to resolve the error, at no additional cost to the sender or the designated recipient. The Bureau did not receive any comments objecting to these remedies. Therefore, the statutory remedies set forth in proposed § 205.33(c)(2)(i) and (ii) are adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.33(c)(2)(i)(A) and (B), respectively, for errors under § 1005.33(a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(iii), and § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) and (<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), respectively, for an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv). Thus, the final rule clarifies that these remedies do not apply to a sender's request for documentation or for additional information or clarification under § 1005.33(a)(1)(v), where the appropriate remedy is the requested documentation, information, or clarification. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) as discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>However, as discussed above with respect to proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv)(B), the Bureau believes that if the failure to make funds from a remittance transfer available on the disclosed date of availability is caused by the sender providing incorrect information in connection with the remittance transfer to the provider, the sender's mistake should not obligate a remittance transfer provider to bear all the costs for resending the remittance transfer. As noted above, many industry commenters objected to the requirement that the remittance transfer provider absorb the costs of amending and resending a transfer when the sender is at fault because doing so would require the remittance transfer provider and other senders, through higher fees, to bear the responsibility for a sender's mistake.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Therefore, § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) does not require that providers send to the designated recipient the amount appropriate to resolve the error at no additional cost to the sender or the designated recipient if the sender provided incorrect information in connection with the remittance transfer to the provider. Instead, § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) provides that if the sender provided incorrect information to the remittance transfer provider in connection with the remittance transfer, third party fees may be imposed for resending the remittance transfer with the corrected information. Section 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) permits third party fees and taxes that were actually incurred in the earlier transmission attempt to be imposed for the resend, but does not permit remittance transfer providers to charge senders a second time for the provider's own fees.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is making this distinction in order to apply the rule without requiring complicated individualized analyses and allocations of the expenses actually incurred in connection with a failed transaction. The Bureau believes this approach strikes a more appropriate balance between the interests of providers and senders than the proposed rule of not permitting any fees to be imposed for the resend, given that third party fees and taxes are not controlled by the provider and are simply being passed on from other actors. Furthermore, the Bureau believes that affiliates of remittance transfer providers, like providers themselves, should not assess fees for resending a remittance transfer with corrected information.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also believes that if a sender provides insufficient information to enable the remittance transfer provider to complete the transfer as requested, third party fees should be permitted to be imposed for resending the remittance transfer with the additional information. For example, a sender may only provide a partial name for the designated recipient such that the entity distributing the funds cannot determine whether the person picking up the funds or the name associated with the account is the intended designated recipient. Therefore, § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) provides that if the sender provided insufficient information to the remittance transfer provider in connection with the remittance transfer, third party fees may be imposed for resending the remittance transfer with the additional information.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adopting a new comment 33(c)-2 to clarify § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>). The comment generally incorporates proposed comment 33(a)-6 to clarify that if the failure to make funds from a transfer available by the disclosed date of availability occurred due to the provider's miscommunication of information necessary for the designated recipient to pick up the transfer, such as providing the incorrect location where the transfer may be picked up or providing the wrong confirmation number or code for the transfer, such failure would not be treated as a failure caused by the sender providing incorrect or insufficient information in connection with the remittance transfer to the provider. The comment also clarifies that while third party fees may be imposed for resending the remittance transfer with the corrected or additional information, the remittance transfer provider may not require the sender to provide the principal transfer amount again.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, if funds were not exchanged in the first unsuccessful attempt of the remittance transfer, the provider must use the exchange rate it is using for such transfers on the date of the resend. The Bureau recognizes that this approach is different from the approach adopted for other errors, where the provider must apply the exchange rate stated in the receipt or combined disclosure. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 33(c)-3, discussed below. For errors where the failure was not caused by the sender providing incorrect or insufficient information, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate for the remedy to reflect what was promised to the sender. In contrast, when the failure is caused by the sender providing incorrect or insufficient information, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to generally put the provider and the sender in the same position as if the first unsuccessful attempt of the remittance transfer had never occurred.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For example, if a sender instructs a remittance transfer provider to send US$100 to a designated recipient in a foreign country in local currency, for which the remittance transfer provider charges a transfer fee of US$10, and the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information that resulted in non-delivery of the remittance transfer, the remittance transfer provider may not require the sender to provide another US$100 to the remittance transfer provider to send or charge the sender another US$10 transfer fee. If the funds were not exchanged in the first unsuccessful attempt of the remittance transfer, the provider must use the exchange rate it is using for such transfers on the date of the resend.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Based on this rule, if a remittance transfer is deposited in an account that does not belong to the designated recipient named in the receipt because the sender provided the wrong account number for the designated recipient, the provider may charge the sender for resending the remittance transfer, but may not have the sender provide the principal transfer amount again in the event that the remittance transfer provider is unable to have the funds extracted from the wrong account. The Bureau believes that this approach will encourage providers and other parties involved in the remittance transfer to develop security procedures to limit the risk of funds being deposited in an account when the name of the designated recipient named in the receipt does not match the name associated with the account number. The Bureau notes that remittance transfer providers will be supplied with both the name, and if provided by the sender, the telephone number and/or address of the designated recipient, which the provider must disclose on the receipt under § 1005.31(b)(2)(iii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 33(c)-2 clarifies that although third party fees may be imposed on the sender for resending the remittance transfer with the corrected or additional information, third party fees that were not incurred during the first unsuccessful remittance transfer attempt may not be imposed again for resending the remittance transfer. For example, suppose a sender instructed the remittance transfer provider to send US$100 to a designated recipient in a foreign country, for which a remittance transfer provider charges a transfer fee of US$10 and an intermediary institution charges a lifting fee of US$5, such that the designated recipient is expected to receive only US$95, as indicated in the receipt. If the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information that resulted in non-delivery of the remittance transfer and the US$5 lifting fee was incurred in the first attempt, the sender may choose to provide an additional amount to offset the US$5 lifting fee deducted in the first unsuccessful remittance transfer attempt and ensure that the designated recipient receives US$95 or may choose to resend the US$95 amount with the understanding that another fee may be deducted by the intermediary institution, as indicated in the receipt. Otherwise, if the US$5 lifting fee was not incurred in the first attempt, then the remittance transfer provider must send the original US$100 for the resend, and the sender may expect a US$5 lifting fee to be imposed by the intermediary institution, as indicated in the receipt. Comment 33(c)-2 also reminds providers that a request to resend a remittance transfer is a request to send a remittance transfer. Therefore, a provider must provide the disclosures required by § 1005.31 for a resend of a remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Board proposed to add a separate, cumulative remedy that would apply if the transfer was not made available to the designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv). This additional remedy was proposed pursuant to the Board's authority under EFTA section 919(d)(1)(B) to provide “such other remedy” as the Board determines appropriate “for the protection of senders.” Under proposed § 205.33(c)(2)(iii), if the remittance transfer was not sent or delivered to the designated recipient by the stated date of availability, the remittance transfer provider would be required to refund all fees charged or imposed in connection with the transfer, even if the consumer asks the provider to send the remittance transfer to the designated recipient as the preferred remedy. If the funds have already been delivered to the recipient, however, even if on an untimely basis, the sole remedy in such case would be the refund of fees.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters objected to the remedy to refund all fees associated with the remittance transfer. As the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, requiring the provider to refund all fees imposed in connection with the remittance transfer, including the transfer fee, is appropriate under such circumstances because the sender did not receive the contracted service, specifically the availability of funds in connection with the transfer by the disclosed date. Furthermore, the Board noted that in some cases, the sender may have paid an additional fee for expedited delivery of funds.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Based on some industry comments, the Bureau believes there may be some confusion regarding when the proposed remedy of refunding fees associated with the remittance transfer may be available. As stated in proposed § 205(c)(2)(iii), the remedy is only available in the case of an error asserted under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iv) (adopted as § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) above). Accordingly, if the remittance transfer provider finds that the error that occurred is, for example, an incorrect amount paid by a sender in connection with a remittance transfer under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(i) (adopted as § 1005.33(a)(1)(i) above), the provider would be under no obligation to refund the fees associated with the remittance transfer to a sender. Instead, the only remedies required to be available to a sender would be a refund of the amount appropriate to resolve the error under proposed § 205(c)(2)(i) (adopted as § 1005(c)(2)(i)(A) above) or to have the amount appropriate to resolve the error sent to the designated recipient, at no additional cost to the sender or the designated recipient under proposed § 205.33(c)(2)(ii) (adopted as § 1005(c)(2)(i)(B) above).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with the Board that the remedy of refunding all fees imposed for the remittance transfer is appropriate if the remittance transfer was not made available to the designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, the Bureau believes that taxes should also be refunded. One industry commenter noted that for certain jurisdictions, the remittance transfer provider may be prohibited by law from refunding taxes. Therefore, the Bureau adopts proposed § 205.33(c)(2)(iii) in renumbered § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B) with the additional requirement to refund taxes to the extent not prohibited by law.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Moreover, consistent with § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), which provides that third party fees may be imposed for resending the remittance transfer if the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information to the remittance transfer provider in connection with the remittance transfer, § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B) provides that the provider need not refund fees imposed for the remittance transfer if the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information to the remittance transfer provider in connection with the remittance transfer. The Bureau is also adopting new § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) to clarify that in the case of an error asserted under § 1005.33(a)(1)(v), which is a request for documentation, additional information or clarification concerning a remittance transfer, the appropriate remedy is providing the requested documentation, information, or clarification.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.33(c)(2) also provided that the remittance transfer provider must correct the error within one business day of, or as soon as reasonably practicable after, receiving the sender's instructions regarding the appropriate remedy. The Board explained that the proposed rule would provide additional flexibility to address the limited circumstances where the particular method of sending a remittance transfer may present practical impediments to a provider's ability to correct an error within one business day. For example, it may not be practicable for a wire transfer that goes through several intermediary institutions before reaching the designated recipient to make the amount in error available to the recipient within one business day in accordance with a sender's request. The Bureau agrees with the Board's rationale in requiring the remittance transfer provider to correct the error within one business day of, or as soon as reasonably practicable after, receiving the sender's instructions regarding the appropriate remedy. The Bureau retains this aspect of proposed § 205.33(c)(2) in renumbered § 1005.33(c)(2) and also includes other clarifying, non-substantive changes.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 33(c)-2 clarified that the remittance transfer provider may request that the sender designate the preferred remedy at the time the sender provides notice of error. As the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, permitting such requests may enable providers to process error claims more expeditiously without waiting for the sender's subsequent instructions after notifying the sender of the results of the investigation. If the sender does not indicate the desired remedy at the time of providing notice of error, the proposed comment provided that the remittance transfer provider must notify the sender of any available remedies in the report provided under proposed § 205.33(c)(1) (adopted as § 1005(c)(1) above) after determining an error occurred. Proposed comment 33(c)-2 is adopted as comment 33(c)-3.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>However, the Board recognized in the May 2011 Proposed Rule that by giving the sender the ability to choose the remedy, the statute, and thus the rule, may make it impossible for a remittance transfer provider to promptly correct an error if the consumer fails to designate an appropriate remedy either at the time of providing the notice of error or in response to the provider's notice informing the consumer of its error determination and available remedies. The Board therefore requested comment on whether remittance transfer providers should be permitted to select a default method of correcting errors.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Both industry and consumer group commenters agreed that there should be a default method of correcting errors. Industry commenters suggested that the remittance transfer provider should be permitted to select the default remedy. Consumer group commenters, however, recommended that the Bureau should set the default remedy of refunding to the sender the appropriate amount.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Based on the comments received, the Bureau adopts a new comment 33(c)-4 to permit a remittance transfer provider to select a default remedy that the provider will use if the sender does not designate a remedy within a reasonable time after the sender receives the report provided under § 1005.33(c)(1). The Bureau believes that providing for a default remedy after a sender has had a reasonable opportunity to choose a remedy would balance the statute's aim to provide a sender the chance to choose his or her preferred remedy with the goal of promptly resolving the sender's outstanding error claim. Furthermore, allowing remittance transfer providers to select the default remedy reduces burden on providers without consumer harm because providers have the ability to provide a preferred remedy without compromising a sender's opportunity to choose.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, new comment 33(c)-4 provides a safe harbor for the amount of time that would be considered reasonable after the report under § 1005.33(c)(1) is provided. Specifically, comment 33(c)-4 states that a provider that permits a sender to designate a remedy within 10 days after the provider has sent the report provided under § 1005.33(c)(1) before selecting the default remedy is deemed to have provided the sender with a reasonable time to designate a remedy. In selecting the 10-day time frame as a safe harbor, the Bureau notes the existence of a similar provision under Regulation Z. Under the commentary to 12 CFR 1026.5(b)(1)(i), a creditor that provides an account-opening disclosure in connection with a balance transfer may effectuate the balance transfer if the consumer has not withdrawn the balance transfer request within 10 days after the creditor has sent the account-opening disclosure. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 5(b)(1)(i)-5 under Regulation Z. New comment 33(c)-4 also clarifies that in the case a default remedy is provided, the remittance transfer provider must correct the error within one business day, or as soon as reasonably practicable, after the reasonable time for the sender to designate the remedy has passed.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters also suggested that the Bureau adopt guidance on how to handle cases where a sender cannot be contacted after an error is discovered by the provider, sender, or recipient. These commenters recommended that three phone calls or emails should constitute a good faith effort to contact the sender. The Bureau notes that the error resolution procedures only apply if the sender asserts an error. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 33(b)-1 adopted above. A notice of error from a sender must contain information to enable the provider to identify the sender's name and telephone number or address. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(b)(1)(ii)(A) adopted above. Therefore, the Bureau believes that remittance transfer providers will have valid contact information from the sender when the sender asserts the error and that remittance transfer providers will make a reasonable effort to contact senders to fulfill their error resolution requirements.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters requested that the final rule clarify the meaning of “amount appropriate to resolve the error.” The Bureau agrees that clarification of this term would be helpful. New comment 33(c)-5 provides that for the purposes of the remedies set forth in § 1005.33(c)(2)(i)(A), (c)(2)(i)(B), (c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>), and (c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), the amount appropriate to resolve the error is the specific amount of transferred funds that should have been received if the remittance transfer had been effected without error. New comment 33(c)-5 further clarifies that the amount appropriate to resolve the error does not include consequential damages.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters requested further guidance on the form a refund may take. In particular, commenters were concerned that remittance transfer providers not be permitted to provide store credit in the refund amount. The Bureau agrees that the form of any refund provided under § 1005.33(c)(2)(i)(A) should generally be the same as the form of payment for the remittance transfer. The Bureau also believes that a provider should also be permitted to provide a refund in cash. Therefore, the Bureau adopts new comment 33(c)-6 to clarify that a remittance transfer provider may, at its discretion, issue a refund either in cash or in the same form of payment that was initially provided by the sender for the remittance transfer. The comment is similar to comment 34(b)-1, discussed below, regarding the form of refund after a cancellation.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is, however, amending comment 34(b)-1 in one respect, which is also reflected in new comment 33(c)-6. Specifically, the Bureau recognizes that if a sender provided cash to the remittance transfer provider for the remittance transfer, there may be instances when a cash refund may not be possible or convenient to the sender. Generally, it is undesirable for a provider to mail cash, and agents may be prohibited from providing cash to consumers. Even if agents were permitted to provide cash refunds, it may be inconvenient to the sender to return to the remittance transfer provider or agent location to pick up the cash refund. Consequently, comments 33(c)-6 and 34(b)-1 state that a provider may issue a refund by check if a sender initially provided cash for the remittance transfer. For example, if the sender originally provided cash as payment for the transfer, the provider may mail a check to the sender in the amount of the payment.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters also suggested that the Bureau consider emphasizing that remittance transfer providers should comply with applicable State escheat laws if the sender cannot be contacted to receive a refund. The Bureau believes that such clarification is unnecessary. Furthermore, the Bureau is concerned that an explicit reference to State escheat laws in this instance may imply that other State laws (for example, State disclosure requirements for money transmitters) do not apply. Consequently, the Bureau declines to adopt this suggestion.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 33(c)-3 provided additional guidance regarding the appropriate remedies where the sender has paid an excess amount to send a remittance transfer. Under that circumstance, the sender may request a refund of the amount paid in excess or may request that the remittance transfer provider make that excess amount available to the designated recipient at no additional cost. The Bureau did not receive any comments on the proposed comment. The Bureau adopts proposed comment 33(c)-3 substantially as proposed in comment 33(c)-7.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Under proposed comment 33(c)-4, fees that must be refunded to a sender for a failure to make funds from a remittance transfer available by the stated date of availability under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) include all fees imposed for the transfer, regardless of the party that imposed the fee, and are not limited to fees imposed by the provider. Some industry commenters objected to having to refund fees not imposed by the remittance transfer provider. As explained above, however, the Bureau believes that refunding all fees is appropriate if the remittance transfer service was not provided as contracted because the funds were not made available by the disclosed date of availability.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is revising proposed comment 33(c)-4, however, to respond to a request from a Federal Reserve Bank commenter to resolve ambiguities in the relationship between the remedies in § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) and (<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) and the remedy in § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B). Specifically, the Bureau has revised proposed comment 33(c)-4, renumbered as comment 33(c)-8, to clarify that the remittance transfer provider must correct the error in accordance with § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A), as applicable. Therefore, if the remittance transfer was made available to the designated recipient, but on an untimely basis, the remedies under § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A) would not be applicable. In that circumstance, the “amount appropriate to resolve the error” would be zero since the entire transfer amount was made available to the designated recipient. The sender's only remedy in this case would be the refund of fees under § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B). If, however, the funds were never made available to the designated recipient, then the sender would have one of the remedies available under § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) or (<em data-original="E-03">2</em>) in addition to the remedy of the fee refund under § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B). The Bureau also believes the renumbering in § 1005.33(c)(2) should make this clear.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 33(c)-5 clarified that if an error occurred, whether as alleged or in a different amount or manner, a remittance transfer provider may not impose any charges related to any aspect of the error resolution process, including any charges for documentation or investigation. As discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the Board expressed concern that such fees or charges might have a chilling effect on a sender's good faith assertion of errors and noted that the proposed comment is similar to comment 11(c)-3 for EFTs. Proposed 33(c)-5, however, also stated that nothing would prohibit a remittance transfer provider from imposing a fee for making copies of documentation for non-error-resolution-related purposes, such as for tax documentation purposes under § 1005.33(a)(2)(iii). The Bureau did not receive any comments on the proposed comment. Therefore, the Bureau adopts proposed comment 33(c)-5 as proposed in comment 33(c)-9.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, under proposed comment 33(c)-6, a remittance transfer provider may correct an error, without further investigation, in the amount or manner alleged by the sender to be in error. This is similar to comment 11(c)-4 for EFTs. As with comment 11(c)-4, the provider must otherwise comply with all other applicable requirements of the error resolution procedures, including providing notice of the resolution of the error. Commenters did not address this proposed comment. Therefore, the Bureau adopts proposed comment 33(c)-6 substantially as proposed in comment 33(c)-10.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>1005.33(c) Time Limits and Extent of Investigation</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.33(c)(2) implements EFTA section 919(d)(1)(B) and establishes procedures and remedies for correcting an error under the Remittance Rule. In particular, where there has been an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) for failure to make funds available to a designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability, § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii) generally permits a sender to choose either: (1) To obtain a refund of the amount the sender paid to the remittance transfer provider in connection with the remittance transfer that was not properly transmitted, or an amount appropriate to resolve the error, or (2) to have the provider resend to the designated recipient the amount appropriate to resolve the error, at no additional cost to the sender or designated recipient. However, if the error resulted from the sender providing incorrect or insufficient information, § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) requires a provider to refund or, at the consumer's request, reapply to a new transfer, the total amount that the sender paid to the provider, but it permits the provider to deduct from this amount fees actually imposed and, where not otherwise prohibited by law, taxes actually collected as part of the first unsuccessful remittance transfer attempt. Comment 33(c)-12 provides guidance on how a remittance transfer provider should determine the amount to refund to the sender, or to apply to a new transfer, pursuant to § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii). As explained in comment 33(c)-12, § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) does not permit a provider to deduct its own fees from the amount refunded or applied to a new transfer. The Bureau proposed to amend § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) by incorporating this guidance in current comment 33(c)-12 in the text of proposed § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) would have stated that in the case of an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) that occurred because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information in connection with the remittance transfer, the remittance transfer provider shall provide the remedies required by § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A)(1) and (B) within three business days of providing the report required by § 1005.33(c)(1) or (d)(1) except that the provider may agree to the sender's request, upon receiving the results of the error investigation, that the funds be applied towards a new remittance transfer, rather than be refunded, if the provider has not yet processed a refund. Proposed § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) also would have provided that the provider may deduct from the amount refunded or applied towards a new transfer any fees actually imposed on or, to the extent not prohibited by law, taxes actually collected on the remittance transfer as part of the first unsuccessful remittance transfer attempt except that the provider shall not deduct its own fee.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In connection with the proposed change to § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii), the Bureau also proposed to modify comment 33(c)-5 by adding an example to further explain how a remittance transfer provider should determine the appropriate amount to resolve any error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv). Proposed comment 33(c)-5 would have explained that if the designated recipient received the amount that was disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) before the provider must determine the appropriate remedy, the amount appropriate to resolve the error would be limited to the refund of the appropriate fees and taxes that the sender paid, as determined by § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B) or (c)(2)(iii) as applicable.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One consumer group commented on this aspect of the Proposal and supported the proposed clarifications. Industry commenters had mixed reactions. Several bank commenters and trade associations supported, or did not object to, the specific clarifications that the Bureau had proposed. However, a number of industry commenters asserted the general concern that it was not fair to prohibit remittance transfer providers from deducting their own fees from the amount refunded to a sender or applied to a new transfer in the case of an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv), due to the sender providing incorrect or insufficient information.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Current § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii), as clarified by current comment 33(c)-12, already prohibits remittance transfer providers from deducting their own fees in the situation described above. Proposed § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) would have stated more explicitly what is already required under current § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii), and, relatedly, proposed comment 33(c)-5 would have illustrated the existing requirement regarding the appropriate refund amount required to resolve an error pursuant to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) with an example. Further, this refund requirement has been part of the Remittance Rule since it was initially adopted in February 2012 and has been was in place since the rule took effect in October 2013.<footnote ref="25">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 77 FR 6257 (Feb. 7, 2012); 78 FR 6025 (Jan. 29, 2013).</footnote>
           The Bureau did not intend for the April Proposal to reopen the issue of what the appropriate remedy would be in the case of an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) that occurred because a sender did not provide correct or sufficient information in connection with a remittance transfer. The Bureau simply intended for the April Proposal clarify § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) as previously adopted. The Bureau considers comments from industry commenters regarding whether it is appropriate for them to have to deduct their own fees from the amount refunded to a sender or applied to a new transfer in the case of an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv), due to the sender providing incorrect or insufficient information in connection with the transfer, to be outside the scope of this rulemaking.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, consistent with the Bureau's intent to clarify the requirement with respect to the appropriate remedy under § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii), the Bureau is adopting a technical correction to comment 33(c)-12.i to describe the total amount that a sender has paid the provider, the total amount of the refund that such sender will receive, and the portion of the total refund that is attributable to the provider's refund of its own fee in greater detail. The Bureau believes that revised comment 33(c)-12.i provides greater clarity with respect to how the total refund amount is calculated but the changes adopted do not alter the calculations. The Bureau believes that it is appropriate to adopt this technical correction without notice and comment because the correction is consistent with the Bureau's intent to clarify the requirement with respect to the appropriate remedy under § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii).<footnote ref="26">One large bank commenter suggested that the Bureau clarify current comment 33(c)(12)-i by revising it to add the remittance transfer provider's fee to the total refund amount. The Bureau believes that the technical correction to comment 33(c)-12.i addresses the commenter's concern.</footnote>

      <title>18(c)(4) Inclusion of All Fees Charged</title>
      <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 906(c), generally implemented in § 1005.9(b), provides that, among other things, a periodic statement must include the amount of any fees assessed against an account for EFTs or account maintenance. The Bureau notes that Regulation DD requires that periodic statements disclose all fees debited to accounts covered by that regulation.<footnote ref="479">Regulation DD § 1030.6(a)(3).</footnote>
             Regulation DD defines “account” to mean “a deposit account at a depository institution that is held by or offered to a consumer. It includes time, demand, savings, and negotiable order of withdrawal accounts.” <footnote ref="480">Regulation DD § 1030.2(a).</footnote>
             Because some prepaid accounts, as proposed to be defined under Regulation E, may not also constitute accounts as defined under Regulation DD (or the corresponding regulations applicable to credit unions),<footnote ref="481">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 12 CFR part 707.</footnote>
             the Bureau proposed § 1005.18(c)(3) to ensure that periodic statements and histories of account transactions for all prepaid accounts include all fees, not just those related to EFTs and account maintenance.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(c)(3) would have stated that a periodic statement furnished pursuant to § 1005.9(b) for a prepaid account, an electronic history of account transactions whether provided under proposed § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) or otherwise, and a written history of account transactions provided under proposed § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii) must disclose the amount of any fees assessed against a prepaid account, whether for EFTs or otherwise. The Bureau received no comments on this portion of the proposal.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is finalizing § 1005.18(c)(3), renumbered as § 1005.18(c)(4), substantially as proposed, with several modifications for clarity. To further the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account consumers, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to modify the periodic statement requirements of EFTA section 906(c) to require inclusion of all fees charged. These revisions will assist consumers' understanding of their prepaid account activity. In addition, the Bureau is also using its disclosure authority pursuant to section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act because the Bureau believes that comprehensive disclosure of fee information will help ensure that the features of prepaid accounts are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers, over the term of the product or service, in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with prepaid accounts.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.18(c)(4) states that a financial institution must disclose the amount of any fees assessed against the account, whether for EFTs or otherwise, on any periodic statement provided pursuant to § 1005.9(b) and on any history of account transactions provided or made available by the financial institution.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adopting new comment 18(c)-7 to further clarify the requirements of final § 1005.18(c)(4). Specifically, this comment explains that a financial institution that furnishes a periodic statement pursuant to § 1005.9(b) for a prepaid account must disclose the amount of any fees assessed against the account, whether for EFTs or otherwise, on the periodic statement as well as on any electronic or written account transaction history the financial institution makes available or provides to the consumer. For example, if a financial institution sends periodic statements and also makes available the consumer's electronic account transaction history on its Web site, the financial institution must disclose the amount of any fees assessed against the account, whether for EFTs or otherwise, on the periodic statement and on the consumer's electronic account transaction history made available on its Web site. Likewise, a financial institution that follows the periodic statement alternative in final § 1005.18(c)(1) must disclose the amount of any fees assessed against the account, whether for EFTs or otherwise, on the electronic history of the consumer's account transactions made available pursuant to final § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) and any written history of the consumer's account transactions provided pursuant to final § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau sought comment on whether any other specific protections of Regulation DD, which may not apply to prepaid accounts provided by financial institutions (as defined in Regulation E) that are not depository institutions (as defined in Regulation DD), could be addressed for all prepaid accounts to ensure consistent protections for prepaid accounts regardless of who is providing the account. The Bureau received no comments on this issue and the Bureau is making no additional changes to final § 1005.18(c)(4) other than those discussed herein.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(b)(5) would have explained that disclosures that would have been required under § 1005.18(b) that are provided in writing or electronically must be segregated from everything else and could contain only information that is directly related to the disclosures required under § 1005.18(b). The Bureau believed it was important that only the information it would have required to be disclosed be included on the short form and long form disclosures. The Bureau noted that financial institutions (or whatever entity is responsible for marketing the prepaid account) could use the remainder of a prepaid account's packaging material or Web site to disclose other information to a consumer, but the Bureau believed it was important to limit the amount of information permitted in the required disclosures to protect the integrity of their design.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>A number of industry commenters, including trade associations and program managers, as well as several employers and a local government agency commented on the proposed segregation provision, recommending that the Bureau eliminate the segregation requirements for payroll card account disclosures to permit inclusion in the short form and long form of State-required information for prepaid accounts. Some commenters said that much of this information could not be feasibly or lawfully disclosed on other parts of the packaging material or online and would require a third disclosure form in addition to the short form and long form disclosures just to disclose State-required information.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.18(b)(5), renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(7)(iii), with technical modifications for conformity and clarity. The Bureau is also adopting new comment 18(b)(7)(iii)-1.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the proposal, to preserve the design integrity of the short form and long form disclosures, which the Bureau believes will facilitate consumer engagement and optimal consumer comprehension, it is necessary that the information in these disclosures be restricted to that required or permitted under this final rule. Thus, the final rule requires that the short form and long form disclosures required by final § 1005.18(b)(2) and (4) must be segregated from other information and must contain only information that is required or permitted for those disclosures by final § 1005.18(b).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 18(b)(7)(iii)-1 addresses information permitted outside the short form and long form disclosures. Specifically, the comment explains that the segregation requirement does not prohibit the financial institution from providing information elsewhere on the same page as the short form disclosure, such as the information required by final § 1005.18(b)(5) (that is, the names of the financial institution and prepaid account program and any purchase price or activation fee), additional disclosures required by State law for payroll card accounts, or any other information the financial institution wishes to provide about the prepaid account. Similarly, the comment explains that the segregation requirement does not prohibit a financial institution from providing the long form disclosure on the same page as other disclosures or information, or as part of a larger document, such as the prepaid account agreement, cross-referencing § 1005.18(b)(1) and (f)(1).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Thus, as long as the long form disclosure remains intact and free of extraneous information not required or permitted within its structure, neither the segregation requirement nor any other part of the final rule prohibits disclosure of the long form as part of the cardholder agreement. Thus, the long form may be disclosed as a separate document or may be inserted intact within another document such as the cardholder agreement.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau declines to exclude payroll card accounts from the segregation requirements of final § 1005.18(b)(7)(iii), as requested by some commenters. The Bureau believes it is necessary to preserve the design integrity of the short form and long form disclosures for all types of prepaid accounts. The Bureau notes that, pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii), all fees and conditions, including those required by State law, must be disclosed in the long form disclosure. Thus, inclusion of State-required information in the long form (with regard to fees and the conditions under which they may be imposed for the prepaid account) would not only <em data-original="E-03">not</em> violate the segregation requirements of final § 1005.18(b)(7)(iii) but exclusion of this information would violate the requirements of final § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) to disclose all fees and conditions. The Bureau acknowledges, however, that State laws may have other specific presentation requirements for their disclosures that may not correspond to the final rule's requirements for the long form as set forth in final § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) and (6)(iii)(A) and thus may necessitate additional disclosure in a format that complies with those requirements.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With regard to the short form disclosure, see the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B) above for discussion of how State-required and other fee discounts and waivers may be disclosed in conjunction with the short form disclosure. Pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B), the final rule permits disclosure in the short form for payroll card accounts (and government benefit accounts pursuant to final § 1005.15(c)(2)(ii)) of a statement directing consumers to State-required information and other fee discounts and waivers, whether this information is located on the same page as (but outside) the short form disclosure or in another location such as the cardholder agreement or on a Web site.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Also, because payroll card accounts (and government benefit accounts) are not provided in retail locations where space may be limited, the Bureau is not persuaded by arguments that State-required information cannot be provided in other ways such as on the same page but outside the short form disclosure, on another portion of the packaging for the prepaid account, or in a package of information accompanying the account.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(iii) required the disclosure of the total amount of the transaction. Although this total is not required by the statute, the Board proposed to require the disclosure of the total amount of the transaction to further the purposes of the EFTA by enabling a sender to understand the total amount to be paid out-of-pocket for the transaction.

      <title>11(c) Time Limits and Extent of Investigation</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is making a conforming change to § 1005.11 to except unverified accounts from the provisional credit requirements therein, in conformance with changes to the error resolution requirements for prepaid accounts in revised § 1005.18(e) below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 908 governs the timing and other requirements for consumers and financial institutions pertaining to error resolution, including provisional credit, and is implemented for accounts under Regulation E generally, including payroll card accounts, in § 1005.11. Section 1005.11(c)(1) and (3)(i) require that a financial institution, after receiving notice that a consumer believes an EFT from the consumer's account was not authorized, must investigate promptly and determine whether an error occurred (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> whether the transfer was unauthorized), within 10 business days (20 business days if the EFT occurred within 30 days of the first deposit to the account). Existing § 1005.11(c)(2) provides that if the financial institution is unable to complete the investigation within 10 business days, its investigation may take up to 45 days if it provisionally credits the amount of the alleged error back to the consumer's account within 10 business days of receiving the error notice.<footnote ref="327">The financial institution has 90 days (instead of 45) to investigate if the claimed unauthorized EFT was not initiated in a state, resulted from a point-of-sale debit card transaction, or occurred within 30 days after the first deposit to the account was made. § 1005.11(c)(3)(ii).</footnote>
             Provisional credit is not required if the financial institution requests but does not receive written confirmation within 10 business days of an oral notice by the consumer, or if the alleged error involves an account that is subject to Regulation T of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Securities Credit by Brokers and Dealers, 12 CFR part 220).<footnote ref="328">§ 1005.11(c)(2)(i)(A) and (B).</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed in § 1005.18(e)(2) to extend to all prepaid accounts the error resolution provisions of Regulation E, including provisional credit, with modifications to the § 1005.11 timing requirements in proposed § 1005.18(e)(2) for financial institutions following the periodic statement alternative in proposed § 1005.18(c)(1). In addition, the Bureau proposed to use its exception authority under EFTA section 904(c) to propose § 1005.18(e)(3); that provision would have provided that for prepaid accounts that are not payroll card accounts or government benefit accounts, if a financial institution disclosed to the consumer the risks of not registering a prepaid account using a notice that is substantially similar to the proposed notice contained in paragraph (c) of appendix A-7, a financial institution would not have been required to comply with the liability limits and error resolution requirements under §§ 1005.6 and 1005.11 for any prepaid account for which it had not completed its collection of consumer identifying information and identity verification.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in greater detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(e)(3) below, the Bureau is revising the limitation on financial institutions' obligations to provide limited liability and error resolution protections for prepaid accounts that have not completed the consumer identification and verification process. Rather than allow financial institutions to forego providing all of the limited liability and error resolution protections for such unverified accounts, as the Bureau proposed, the final rule allows financial institutions to forego extending provisional credit to such accounts as part of the error resolution process—under the final rule, therefore, financial institutions may take up to 45 days (or 90 days, where applicable) to investigate an error claim without provisionally crediting the account in the amount at issue for prepaid accounts with respect to which the financial institution has not completed its consumer identification and verification process. To implement this revision, the Bureau is adopting an exception to the general requirement in § 1005.11(c)(2) that a financial institution must provide provisional credit if it takes longer than 10 business days to investigate and determine whether an error occurred. As stated above, there are two existing exceptions listed in § 1005.11(c)(2)(i)(A) (no provisional credit where institution required, but did not receive, written confirmation of the oral notice of error within 10 business days) and § 1005.11(c)(2)(i)(B) (no provisional credit where error involves an account subject to the Board's Regulation T). The Bureau is adding a third exception in new § 1005.11(c)(2)(i)(C), which, together with § 1005.11(c)(2)(i), provides that a financial institution does not have to provisionally credit a consumer's account if the alleged error involves a prepaid account, other than a payroll card account or government benefit account, for which the financial institution has not completed its consumer identification and verification process, as set forth in § 1005.18(e)(3)(ii).<footnote ref="329">Pursuant to § 1005.18(e)(3)(ii), a financial institution has not completed its consumer identification and verification process where it has not concluded its consumer identification and verification process; it has concluded its consumer identification and verification process, but could not verify the identity of the consumer; or it does not have a consumer identification and verification process by which the consumer can register the prepaid account. See the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(e)(3) below for a detailed explanation of these provisions and related commentary.</footnote>
             The Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to finalize this exclusion pursuant to its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to further the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account consumers.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>By adding an exception for unverified accounts to the provisional credit requirement set forth in § 1005.11(c)(2)(i), the Bureau intends to clarify the scope of the revised exception in final § 1005.18(e)(3). Specifically, although the Bureau is finalizing a provision that would allow financial institutions not to extend provisional credit to prepaid accounts for which the financial institution has not completed its consumer identification and verification process, all other timing and related requirements set forth in § 1005.11(c), as modified by final § 1005.18(e)(2), will apply to both verified and unverified accounts. The addition of new § 1005.11(c)(2)(i)(C), therefore, is intended to make clear that accounts referenced in that provision are only exempted from the provisional credit requirement in § 1005.11(c)(2)(i), and not from any other provisions of § 1005.11(c). Final §§ 1005.11(c)(2)(i)(C) and 1005.18(e)(3) reference each other for added clarity.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>32(b)(3) Estimates for Non-Covered Third-Party Fees and Taxes Collected by a Person Other Than the Provider</title>
      <analysisParagraph>As described above, the Bureau is eliminating the requirement to disclose certain recipient institution fees and taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider and to include such amounts in the amount received, required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) and (b)(2)(i).  Nevertheless, the Bureau believes that where the remittance transfer provider knows or can reasonably estimate any applicable non-covered third-party fee or tax collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider and elects to disclose one or both of such amounts, senders are likely to benefit from more accurate and informative disclosures.  Consequently, § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) permits a provider to disclose any applicable non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider applicable to a remittance transfer in conjunction with the required disclaimers. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In order to encourage the optional disclosure of such information, § 1005.32(b)(3) of the 2013 Final Rule permits remittance transfer providers latitude to estimate any applicable non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider.  Such estimates may be based on reasonable sources of information.  The Bureau acknowledges that permitting providers to estimate such amounts may result in providers providing disclosures that may not reflect the actual charge by individual recipient institutions or the taxes levied upon such transfers.  Nonetheless, the Bureau believes that permitting a reasonable approximation of the amount of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on the remittance transfer by persons other than the remittance transfer provider that could be assessed based on reasonable sources would provide senders valuable information about the amount to be received while also allowing the provider sufficient flexibility to disclose such information. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 32(b)(3)-1 further notes that reasonable sources of information may include, for example: Information obtained from recent transfers to the same institution or the same country or region; fee schedules from the recipient institution; fee schedules from the recipient institution's competitors; surveys of recipient institution fees in the same country or region as the recipient institution; information provided or surveys of recipient institutions' regulators or taxing authorities; commercially or publicly available databases, services or sources; and information or resources developed by international nongovernmental organizations or intergovernmental organizations.  The 2013 Final Rule also includes new model forms that provides examples of how such information may be integrated within the disclaimers of § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii). <em data-original="E-03">See</em> Model Forms 30(b)-(d).</analysisParagraph>

Conforming changes have also been made to comments 32(a)(1)-1, (a)(1)-2.ii, 32(a)(1)-3.ii, and 32(b)(2)-1 so that these comments and related headings, as finalized, use the term “covered third-party fees” rather than “other fees.” </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In § 1005.32(c)(3)(ii), however, the Bureau notes that it has retained a reference to fees imposed by both the intermediary and the final recipient's institution.  Although fees imposed by the recipient institution are generally non-covered third-party fees, under § 1005.30(h), certain recipient institution fees may qualify as covered third-party fees if they are imposed by an agent of the provider. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 30(h)-2.ii. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition to the conforming changes related to the disclosure of covered third-party fees pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), references to taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider in § 1005.32(b)(2)(ii) and (c)(4) of the 2012 Final Rule have been deleted and § 1005.32(c)(5) has been renumbered as § 1005.32(c)(4).

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(c)(4) would have required financial institutions to provide a summary total of the amount of all fees assessed against the consumer's prepaid account, the total amount of all deposits to the account, and the total amount of all debits from the account, for the prior calendar month and for the calendar year to date. This information would have been disclosed on any periodic statement provided pursuant to § 1005.9(b), in any electronic history of account transactions whether provided pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) or otherwise, and on any written history of account transactions provided pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii). The Bureau's proposed summary total of fees requirement was similar to the requirement to disclose fees and interest in open-end credit plans under Regulation Z.<footnote ref="482">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Regulation Z § 1026.7(b)(6).</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 18(c)-5 would have explained that if a financial institution provides periodic statements pursuant to § 1005.9(b), the total fees, deposits, and debits may be disclosed for each statement period rather than for each calendar month, if different. Proposed comment 18(c)-5 would have also explained that the fees that must be included in the summary total include those that are required to be disclosed pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii)(A). For example, an institution would have been required to include the fee it charges a consumer for using an out-of-network ATM in the summary total of fees, but it would not have been required to include any fee charged by an ATM operator with whom the institution has no relationship for the consumer's use of that operator's ATM.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, proposed comment 18(c)-5 would have explained that the summary total of fees should be net of any fee reversals and that the total amount of all debits from the account should be exclusive of fees assessed against the account. Finally, proposed comment 18(c)-5 would have explained that the total deposits and total debits must include all deposits to and debits from the prepaid account, not just those deposits and debits that are the result of EFTs.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received comments from several consumer groups, who supported this portion of the proposal and argued that setting apart monthly and year-to-date fee totals would help consumers understand the costs associated with their accounts and how to minimize fees. These commenters stated that financial institutions should also be required to include a statement that indicates actions consumers can take to lower their fees, such as using network ATMs.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several industry groups, including program managers, issuing banks, credit unions, and a trade association generally supported this portion of the proposal and the goal of providing consumers access to information needed to manage their prepaid accounts, but cautioned that implementing the requirement as proposed would require more time than the proposed nine-month compliance period and would require costly system updates. For example, a credit union explained that the proposed summary total of fees requirement would be complex and burdensome for a financial institution that houses its data with a third-party processor and stated that retrieving the data to perform the analysis would be costly. In addition, an issuing bank explained that the proposal would require changes to the prepaid account processing infrastructure design and stated that those changes would be inconsistent with how statements are calculated for checking and other consumer asset accounts that tend to share the same processing infrastructure. A government benefits card program manager argued that, because the summary totals requirement would take significant time and investments to implement, the Bureau should exempt government benefit accounts from this aspect of the proposal. A program manager argued that the summary totals requirement would not be appropriate for non-reloadable products. A program manager requested that, for financial institutions that do not have the data to calculate the summary totals as of the final rule's effective date, the requirement be implemented on a going-forward basis only.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Regarding the proposed requirement to disclose the summary totals of fees specifically, these commenters stated that they recognize the value in providing aggregated fees paid over time and therefore support the overall goal the Bureau seeks to achieve by including this provision. However, several industry commenters, including program managers and issuing banks, urged the Bureau to require financial institutions to include in the summary totals of fees only fees that are discernible to the financial institution. These commenters explained that a transaction that includes a third-party fee, such as an out-of-network ATM fee, may not separate the fee portion from the total amount and therefore determining the fee amounts for each consumer would be costly and burdensome. These commenters also stated that financial institutions cannot provide details about or accurately disclose those fees. An issuing bank stated that a financial institution also cannot determine whether a fee was waived due to the consumer's relationship with the third party. One consumer group argued, however, that financial institutions can determine the amounts of third-party fees. This commenter explained that, if a consumer withdraws $40 in cash from an ATM that charges a $2.50 out-of-network fee, the withdrawal will appear as $42.50, and the financial institution would be able to discern the $2.50 third-party fee. A payroll card program manager requested that the Bureau allow financial institutions to provide a form disclaimer regarding fees that are outside of the financial institution's control or an example showing consumers when such fees may occur. Another program manager requested that the Bureau allow financial institutions to distinguish fees for using a prepaid account (such as per transaction fees), optional fees, and third-party fees.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters also suggested other modifications to this aspect of the proposal, which they believed would minimize the costs and burdens to industry. For example, a credit union requested that financial institutions not be required to provide paper statements displaying the summary totals of fees and argued that displaying fees on electronic statements is sufficient and the most appropriate way to communicate with consumers. Another credit union and a program manager requested that the year-to-date calculation be eliminated. The credit union argued that consumers usually find year-to-date totals confusing and can instead calculate their own totals using the information available online. On the other hand, another program manager argued that that the proposed summary by calendar month is overly proscriptive and inconsistent with consumer usage and preference. This commenter explained that the transaction history begins on the date of the first transaction (not the first day of the month) and continues until the account is closed or becomes inactive for a period of time.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One issuing bank opposed this portion of the proposal altogether, arguing that providing summary totals of fees would not help consumers understand how to limit such fees, unless the summary distinguishes behavior-based fees (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> fees that apply to certain conduct engaged in by the accountholder, such as out-of-network ATM fees) from service-based fees (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> fees that apply to all accountholders without regard to conduct, such as monthly fees). This commenter also requested, if the Bureau decides to finalize this portion of the proposal, that the Bureau clarify definitions for the terms fee, deposit, and debit.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is finalizing proposed § 1005.18(c)(4), renumbered as § 1005.18(c)(5), with modifications as described below. To further the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account consumers, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to modify the periodic statement requirements of EFTA section 906(c) to require a summary total of both monthly and annual fees. These proposed revisions will assist consumers' understanding of their prepaid account activity. In addition, the Bureau is also using its disclosure authority pursuant to section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act because the Bureau believes that disclosure of these summary totals of fees will help ensure that the features of prepaid accounts, over the term of the product or service, are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with prepaid accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is finalizing the requirement that financial institutions provide the summary totals of the amount of all fees assessed by the financial institution against the consumer's prepaid account for the prior calendar month and for the calendar year to date. The Bureau has removed the requirement that financial institutions provide summary totals of all deposits to and debits from a consumer's prepaid account from the final rule.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes the final rule will provide consumers important information for better understanding and managing their prepaid accounts. The Bureau agrees with commenters that displaying the summary totals of fees is valuable to consumers and believes the requirement will be an important consumer education and money management tool that will help consumers understand the actual costs of using their prepaid accounts. The Bureau believes that this requirement will be beneficial to consumers of all prepaid accounts, including government benefit accounts, and is therefore not exempting any accounts from this requirement. The Bureau is not, however, requiring financial institutions to include a statement that indicates actions consumers can take to lower their fees, as requested by consumer group commenters. The Bureau does not believe such a requirement justifies the additional costs to financial institutions at this time. However, the Bureau believes it is beneficial for financial institution to educate and inform consumers on how to avoid fees, as many do currently. The Bureau will continue to monitor industry practice and may revisit this issue at a later time.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that not requiring financial institutions to provide the summary totals of all deposits to and debits from a prepaid account will not harm consumers. The Bureau believes that consumers likely know how much money is deposited into and debited out of their accounts and can easily calculate this information by using the data from their transaction history and account balance. In addition, the Bureau believes that the modification to limit the summary totals requirement to fees only and the modifications to the rule's effective date discussed below addresses industry commenters' concerns about not having sufficient time to implement the requirement.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is finalizing the proposed portion of § 1005.18(c)(4) (renumbered as § 1005.18(c)(5)) that requires the summary totals of fees to appear on any periodic statement for a prepaid account provided pursuant to § 1005.9(b) and on any history of account transactions provided or made available by the financial institution pursuant to final § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) and (iii). As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(c)(1) above, consumers value receiving information about their accounts in both electronic and paper forms. The Bureau believes that it is important for consumers to have access to summary totals of fees for their accounts regardless of the method by which they access their account information.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is not requiring that third-party fees, such as out-of-network ATM fees and cash reload fees, be included in the summary totals. Final § 1005.18(c)(5) provides, in part, that the summary totals consist of fees assessed by the financial institution against the consumer's account, as explained further in comment 18(c)-8.ii, discussed below. The Bureau agrees with industry commenters that, even if financial institutions can determine whether third-party fees were assessed against a prepaid account, requiring them to extract details about such fees could be problematic for financial institutions, especially for transactions that involve foreign currency conversion calculations. The Bureau notes that third-party cash reload fees do not need to be included in the summary totals of fees. This is different from how cash reload fees are treated in the pre-acquisition disclosures context, where financial institutions must include third-party cash reload fees on the short form disclosure.<footnote ref="483">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; final § 1005.18(b)(2)(iv); &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;see also&lt;/em&gt; final § 1005.18(b)(3)(v).</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Regarding a program manager's request to permit financial institutions to distinguish fees in the fee totals, noted above, the Bureau agrees that allowing some flexibility in how financial institutions display summary totals of fees may be beneficial to consumers. The Bureau has clarified in comment 18(c)-9, discussed below, that financial institutions may also include sub-totals of the types of fees that make up the summary totals of fees. The Bureau reminds financial institutions that all disclosures should be clear and readily understandable as required by § 1005.4(a), including the summary totals of fees pursuant to final § 1005.18(c)(5) and any sub-totals thereof.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Regarding industry commenters' concerns about the proposed nine-month effective date, final § 1005.18(h)(1) imposes a general effective date of October 1, 2017 for this final rule. However, final § 1005.18(h)(3)(ii) provides an accommodation for financial institutions that do not have readily accessible the data necessary to calculate the summary totals of fees pursuant to final § 1005.18(c)(5) on October 1, 2017. Specifically, in that case, the financial institution may provide the summary totals using the data it has until the financial institution has accumulated the data necessary to display the summary totals as required by final § 1005.18(c)(5). See the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(h) below for additional discussion regarding the final rule's effective date and related accommodations.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has modified proposed comment 18(c)-5, renumbered as comment 18(c)-8, to reflect the revision to the regulatory text discussed above, and to make several modifications for clarity. Also, for clarity, the Bureau has divided this comment into two parts: Final comment 18(c)-8.i explains the summary totals of fees requirement generally and final comment 18(c)-8.ii clarifies the requirements regarding third-party fees. Specifically, final comment 18(c)-8.i explains that a financial institution that furnishes a periodic statement pursuant to § 1005.9(b) for a prepaid account must display the monthly and annual fee totals on the periodic statement, as well as on any electronic or written account transaction history the financial institution makes available or provides to the consumer. For example, if a financial institution sends periodic statements and also makes available the consumer's electronic account transaction history on its Web site, the financial institution must display the monthly and annual fee totals on the periodic statement and on the consumer's electronic account transaction history made available on its Web site. Likewise, a financial institution that follows the periodic statement alternative in final § 1005.18(c)(1) must display the monthly and annual fee totals on the electronic history of the consumer's account transactions made available pursuant to final § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) and any written history of the consumer's account transactions provided pursuant to final § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii). In addition, this comment clarifies that, if a financial institution provides periodic statements pursuant to § 1005.9(b), fee totals may be disclosed for each statement period rather than each calendar month, if different. This comment also clarifies that the summary totals of fees should be net of any fee reversals.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Final comment 18(c)-8.ii clarifies that a financial institution may, but is not required to, include third-party fees in its summary totals of fees provided pursuant to final § 1005.18(c)(5). For example, a financial institution must include in the summary totals of fees the fee it charges a consumer for using an out-of-network ATM, but it need not include any fee charged by an ATM operator, with whom the financial institution has no relationship, for the consumer's use of that operator's ATM. Similarly, a financial institution need not include in the summary totals of fees the fee charged by a third-party reload network for the service of adding cash to a prepaid account at a point-of-sale terminal.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adopting new comment 18(c)-9 to clarify that a financial institution may, but is not required to, also include sub-totals of the types of fees that make up the summary totals of fees as required by final § 1005.18(c)(5). For example, if a financial institution distinguishes optional fees (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> custom card design fees) from fees to use the account, in displaying the summary totals of fees, the financial institution may include sub-totals of those fees, provided the financial institution also presents the combined totals of all fees.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(b)(7)(ii)(A) General</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii)(A) would have required that all text used to disclose information pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2) be in a single, easy-to-read type face. All text included in the tables required to be disclosed pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(3)(iii) must be all black or one color type and printed on a white or other neutral contrasting background whenever practical. The Bureau believed that contrasting colors for the text and the background of the short form and long form disclosures would make it easier for consumers to read the disclosures. The Bureau did not receive any comments on this proposed requirement.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, and in the absence of comments, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii)(A), renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(7)(ii)(A), with technical modifications for conformity and clarity. In addition, for the reasons set forth below, the Bureau is adopting new comment 18(b)(7)(ii)(A)-1.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The final rule requires that all text used to disclose information in the short form or in the long form disclosure pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2), (3)(i) and (ii), and (4) be in single, easy-to-read type that is all black or one color and printed on a background that provides a clear contrast. The Bureau has removed the proposed requirement that the background be provided in clear contrast to the type whenever practical because the Bureau does not believe there is a circumstance under which providing a clear contrast would not be practical. As stated in the proposal, the Bureau believes that contrasting colors for the text and the background of the short form and long form disclosures will make it easier for consumers to read and comprehend the disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 18(b)(7)(ii)(A)-1 explains that a financial institution complies with the color requirements if, for example, it provides the disclosures required by final § 1005.18(b)(2), (3)(i) and (ii), and (4) printed in black type on a white background or white type on a black background. While the Bureau continues to believe that using black/white for the text and a contrasting white/black for the background of the disclosures would provide an ideal presentation, it also recognizes that using other similarly dark colors for text with a neutral background color could also provide clear contrast. For example, as noted in the proposal, the Bureau believes that the statement at the top of the short form disclosure for payroll card accounts required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(A) disclosed in black type on a grey background, if the background of the rest of the short form disclosure is white, could provide a clear contrast that would help alert consumers to that notice. <em data-original="E-03">See, e.g.,</em> final Model Form A-10(b).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The comment also explains that, pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(7)(ii)(A), the type and color may differ between the short form disclosure and the long form disclosure provided for a particular prepaid account program. For example, a financial institution may use one font/type style for the short form disclosure for a particular prepaid account program and use a different font/type style for the long form disclosure for that same prepaid account program. Similarly, a financial institution may use black type for the short form disclosure for a particular prepaid account program and use blue type for the long form disclosure for that same prepaid account program.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that neither final § 1005.18(b)(7)(ii)(A) nor anything else in the final rule specifies the minimum type size or other prominence requirements for the disclosures required outside the short form by final § 1005.18(b)(5).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(b)(4)(iv) Statement Regarding Overdraft Credit Features</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Under the proposed rule, fees relating to overdraft and certain other credit features would have been subject to the general requirement in proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii)(A) to disclose all fees and the condition under which they may be imposed, as well as the requirement in proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii)(B) to provide certain Regulation Z disclosures if, at any point, a covered credit plan might have been offered in connection with the prepaid account. The proposed rule would not have required a basic statement in the long form regarding whether an overdraft or credit feature could be provided at all in connection with the prepaid account, parallel to the proposed statement in the short form.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Several consumer groups recommended that the long form, as the more comprehensive disclosure, should indicate whether the financial institution offers overdraft or other credit features in connection with that prepaid account program. The Bureau agrees that the long form disclosure, like the short form disclosure, should include an explicit statement as to whether or not the prepaid account offers any overdraft or credit feature because this is key information for consumers to consider in making their purchase and use decisions regarding prepaid accounts. See the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(2)(x) above for further discussion of this disclosure requirement generally. While a financial institution offering a prepaid account program with an overdraft credit feature must disclose in the long form any fees that are imposed in connection with the prepaid account pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii), the Bureau believes a more explicit statement regarding the existence or lack of such a feature is also appropriate, as the availability of such a feature may not be obvious depending on the nature of the fees imposed in connection with the overdraft credit feature and where they are imposed (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> on the prepaid account or on the covered separate credit feature). Moreover, inclusion of this statement makes the short form and long form disclosures parallel with regard to the disclosure of the existence of such a feature and, if one may be offered, the duration of the waiting period, and that fees would apply.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For these reasons, the Bureau is adopting the final rule with the additional requirement in new § 1005.18(b)(4)(iv) to disclose in the long form the same statement regarding overdraft credit features required in the short form pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(x).</analysisParagraph>

        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Consistent with EFTA section 911(a),<footnote ref="330">15 U.S.C. 1693i(a).</footnote>
             existing § 1005.5(a) provides that a financial institution generally may issue an access device for an account that is subject to Regulation E to a consumer only: (1) In response to an oral or written request for the device; or (2) as a renewal of, or in substitution for, an accepted access device, whether issued by the institution or a successor. Nonetheless, consistent with EFTA section 911(b),<footnote ref="331">15 U.S.C. 1693i(b).</footnote>
             existing § 1005.5(b) provides that a financial institution may distribute an access device to a consumer on an unsolicited basis if four enumerated situations are met. These exceptions are particularly important to issuance of debit cards to access checking accounts for which the consumer is eligible for overdraft services or has opened an overdraft line of credit.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In contrast, the issuance rules for a credit card under Regulation Z are more restrictive. Consistent with TILA section 132,<footnote ref="332">15 U.S.C. 1642.</footnote>
             existing Regulation Z § 1026.12(a) provides that regardless of the purpose for which a credit card is to be used, including business, commercial, or agricultural use, no credit card shall be issued to any person except (1) in response to an oral or written request or application for the card; or (2) as a renewal of, or substitute for, an accepted credit card.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1005.12(a) provides guidance on whether the issuance provisions in Regulation E or the unsolicited issuance provisions in Regulations Z apply where access devices under Regulation E also are credit cards under Regulation Z. Specifically, existing § 1005.12(a)(1) currently provides that EFTA and Regulation E govern: (1) The addition to an accepted credit card, as defined in Regulation Z (existing § 1026.12, comment 12-2), of the capability to initiate EFTs; (2) the issuance of an access device that permits credit extensions pursuant to an overdraft line of credit (involving a preexisting agreement between a consumer and a financial institution to extend credit only when the consumer's account is overdrawn or to maintain a specified minimum balance in the consumer's account), or under an overdraft service (as defined in existing § 1005.17(a)); and (3) the addition of an overdraft service, as defined in existing § 1005.17(a), to an accepted access device.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>On the other hand, existing § 1005.12(a)(2) provides that TILA and Regulation Z apply to (1) the addition of a credit feature to an accepted access device; and (2) the issuance of a credit card that is also an access device, except the issuance of an access device that permits credit extensions pursuant to a preexisting overdraft line of credit or under an overdraft service as discussed above. The application of these various provisions to prepaid accounts and revisions to the relevant prongs of existing § 1005.12 are discussed below. The proposal would have amended provisions in existing § 1005.12(a)(1)(ii) so that the rules in TILA and Regulation Z would govern whether a prepaid card could be a credit card when it is issued. Proposed Regulation Z § 1026.12(h) (renumbered as new § 1026.61(c) in the final rule) would have required a credit card issuer to wait at least 30 days from prepaid account registration before opening a credit card account for a holder of a prepaid account, or providing a solicitation or application to the holder of the prepaid account to open a credit card account that would be accessed by the access device for a prepaid account that is a credit card. Thus, proposed Regulation Z § 1026.12(h) would have prevented a prepaid card from being a credit card at the time it was issued if it was issued before the expiration of the 30-day period set forth in proposed Regulation Z § 1026.12(h). Under the proposal, because a prepaid card could not have been a credit card at the time it was issued if it was issued before the expiration of the 30-day period discussed above, the issuance of such a prepaid card would have been governed under the issuance rules in EFTA and Regulation E.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1005.12(a)(2)(ii) currently provides that TILA and Regulation Z apply to the issuance of a credit card that is also an access device, except the issuance of an access device that permits credit extensions pursuant to a preexisting overdraft line of credit or under an overdraft service as discussed in existing § 1005.12(a)(1)(ii). Existing § 1005.12(a)(1)(ii) provides that the issuance rules of EFTA and Regulation E govern the issuance of an access device that permits credit extensions under a preexisting agreement between a consumer and a financial institution only when the consumer's account is overdrawn or to maintain a specified minimum balance in the consumer's account, or under an overdraft service as defined in existing § 1005.17(a).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For checking accounts, a consumer may have a preexisting agreement with the financial institution to cover checks that overdraft the account. This overdraft line of credit would be subject to Regulation Z. If a debit card is then added to access this overdraft line of credit under the preexisting agreement, existing § 1005.12(a)(1)(ii) provides that the debit card (which would also be a credit card under Regulation Z) may be issued under the issuance rules in Regulation E, instead of the issuance rules in Regulation Z. In contrast, Regulation Z's issuance rules apply if the access device can access another type of credit feature when it is issued; for example, one permitting direct extensions of credit that do not involve the asset account. Existing comment 12(a)-2 provides that for access devices that also constitute credit cards, the issuance rules of Regulation E apply if the only credit feature is a preexisting credit line attached to the asset account to cover overdrafts (or to maintain a specified minimum balance) or an overdraft service, as defined in existing § 1005.17(a). Regulation Z rules apply if there is another type of credit feature; for example, one permitting direct extensions of credit that do not involve the asset account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The proposal would have amended existing § 1005.12(a)(1)(ii) to provide that this provision relating to preexisting overdraft lines of credit and overdraft services does not apply to access devices for prepaid accounts. The proposal also would have moved existing comment 12(a)-2 related to preexisting overdraft lines of credit and overdraft services to proposed comment 12(a)-1 and would have revised the comment to explain that it does not apply to access devices for prepaid accounts. Thus, under the proposal, because the existing exception for preexisting overdraft line of credit and overdraft services would not have applied to an access device for a prepaid account, the issuance rules in TILA and Regulation Z would have applied to the issuance of a prepaid card that also a credit card at the time it is issued.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Nonetheless, under the proposal, in proposed Regulation Z § 1026.12(h) (renumbered as new § 1026.61(c) in the final rule), a prepaid card could not have been a credit card when it was issued if it was issued before the expiration of the 30-day period set forth in proposed § 1026.12(h). Proposed Regulation Z § 1026.12(h) would have required a credit card issuer to wait at least 30 days from prepaid account registration before opening a credit card account for a holder of a prepaid account, or providing a solicitation or application to the holder of the prepaid account to open a credit card account, that would be accessed by the access device for a prepaid account that is a credit card. The Bureau proposed to comment 12(a)-3 to explain that an access device for a prepaid account may not access a credit card account when the access device is issued and would have cross referenced proposed Regulation Z § 1026.12(h). Under the proposal, because a prepaid card could not have been a credit card when it was issued if it was issued before the expiration of the 30-day period set forth in proposed Regulation Z § 1026.12(h), the issuance of such a prepaid card would have been governed under the issuance rules in EFTA and Regulation E.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The proposal also would have amended existing § 1005.12(a)(1)(iii) and (2)(i) to address whether Regulation E or Regulation Z governs the addition of a credit feature or plan (including an overdraft credit plan) to a previously issued access device for a prepaid account where the credit feature or plan would have made the access device into a credit card under Regulation Z. Existing § 1005.12(a)(1)(iii) provides that the issuance rules of EFTA and Regulation E govern the addition of an overdraft service, as defined in existing § 1005.17(a), to an accepted access device. The proposal would have amended existing § 1005.12(a)(1)(iii) to provide that this provision does not apply to access devices for prepaid accounts. The proposal also would have moved comment 12(a)-3 which discussed overdraft services as defined in existing § 1005.17(a) to proposed comment 12(a)-2 and revised the comment to indicate that this comment does not apply to access devices for prepaid accounts. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.17 below, the proposal would have revised the term “overdraft service” as defined in existing § 1005.17(a) to exclude a credit plan that is accessed by an access device for a prepaid account where the access device is a credit card under Regulation Z, because these credit plans would have been subject to the provisions in Regulation Z.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The proposal also would have amended existing § 1005.12(a)(2)(i) to provide that the unsolicited issuance rules in TILA and existing Regulation Z § 1026.12(a) would have applied to the addition of a credit feature or plan to an accepted access device, including an access device for a prepaid account, that would make the access device into a credit card under Regulation Z. The proposal would have added proposed comment 12(a)-4 that would have explained that Regulation Z governs the addition of any credit feature or plan to an access device for a prepaid account where the access device also would be a credit card under Regulation Z. Proposed comment 12(a)-4 also would have stated that Regulation Z (existing § 1026.2(a)(20), proposed comment 2(a)(20)-2.ii) would have provided guidance on whether a program constitutes a credit plan, and that Regulation Z (existing § 1026.2(a)(15)(i), proposed comment 2(a)(15)-2) would have defined the term credit card and provided examples of cards or devices that are and are not credit cards.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Comments Received and the Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive any specific comments on its proposal to amend existing § 1005.12(a) and related commentary with respect to the issuance rules, other than those related to general comments from industry not to cover overdraft plans offered on prepaid accounts under Regulation Z. See the <em data-original="E-03">Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z</em> section for a discussion of those comments.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As explained in more detail below, with respect to the issuance rules, the Bureau is amending existing § 1005.12(a) and related commentary consistent with the proposal, with revisions to clarify the intent of the provisions and to be consistent with new Regulation Z § 1026.61.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Issuance of a prepaid card.</em> As discussed above, existing § 1005.12(a)(2)(ii) generally provides that the unsolicited issuance rules in TILA and Regulation Z, which prohibit the unsolicited issuance of credit cards, govern the issuance of a credit card that is also an access device. Existing § 1005.12(a)(1)(ii) provides that the issuance rules of EFTA and Regulation E govern the issuance of an access device that permits credit extensions under a preexisting agreement between a consumer and a financial institution only when the consumer's account is overdrawn or to maintain a specified minimum balance in the consumer's account, or under an overdraft service, as defined in existing § 1005.17(a). Existing comment 12(a)-2 provides that for access devices that also constitute credit cards, the issuance rules of Regulation E apply if the only credit feature is a preexisting overdraft line of credit attached to the asset account to cover overdrafts (or to maintain a specified minimum balance) or an overdraft service, as defined in existing § 1005.17(a). Regulation Z rules apply if there is another type of credit feature; for example, one permitting direct extensions of credit that do not involve the asset account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consistent with the proposal, the Bureau is amending existing § 1005.12(a)(1)(ii) to provide that this provision does not apply to access devices for prepaid accounts. Consistent with the proposal, the final rule moves existing comment 12(a)-2 related to preexisting overdraft lines of credit and overdraft services to final comment 12(a)-1 and revises it to explain that it does not apply to access devices for prepaid accounts. Thus, under the final rule, the existing exception in § 1005.12(a)(1)(ii) for credit extended under a preexisting overdraft line of credit or under an overdraft service does not apply to an access device that accesses a prepaid account. Thus, under the final rule, § 1005.12(a)(2)(ii) provides that the issuance rules in TILA and Regulation Z govern the issuance of an access device for a prepaid account that is a credit card at the time it is issued.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Nonetheless, under new Regulation Z § 1026.61(c), a prepaid card may not be a credit card under Regulation Z when it is issued if the prepaid card is issued prior to expiration of the 30-day period set forth in new § 1026.61(c). New Regulation Z § 1026.61(c) provides that with respect to a covered separate credit feature that could be accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card at any point, a card issuer must not do any of the following until 30 days after the prepaid account has been registered: (1) Open a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card; (2) make a solicitation or provide an application to open a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card; or (3) allow an existing credit feature that was opened prior to the consumer obtaining the prepaid account to become a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new Regulation Z § 1026.61 and a credit card under final Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the proposal would have added comment 12(a)-3 to explain that an access device for a prepaid account may not access a credit card account when the access device is issued and would have cross referenced proposed Regulation Z § 1026.12(h). Consistent with the proposal, the Bureau is adopting new comment 12(a)-3, with revisions to clarify the intent of the provision and to be consistent with new Regulation Z § 1026.61. New comment 12(a)-3 provides that an access device for a prepaid account cannot access a covered separate credit feature as defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61 when the access device is issued if the access device is issued prior to the expiration of the 30-day period set forth in new Regulation Z § 1026.61(c). New comment 12(a)-3 also explains that an access device for a prepaid account that is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card as that term is defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61 is subject to the issuance rules in Regulation E. Because a prepaid access device cannot access a covered separate credit feature that would make the access device into a credit card when the access device is issued if the access device is issued prior to the expiration of the 30-day period set forth in new Regulation Z § 1026.61(c), the issuance rules in EFTA and Regulation E will apply to the issuance of the prepaid access device that does not access a covered separate credit feature as defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z § 1026.61 below, the Bureau has decided to exclude prepaid cards from being covered as credit cards under Regulation Z when they access certain specified types of credit. First, under new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii), a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a “non-covered separate credit feature,” which means that the separate credit feature either (1) cannot be accessed in the course of a prepaid card transaction to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers, or (2) is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. Second, under new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(4), a prepaid card also is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card when the prepaid card accesses incidental credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account where the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit. A prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new Regulation Z § 1026.61 or a credit card under final Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) when it accesses credit from these types of credit features. For more detailed explanations of when prepaid cards are not credit cards under Regulation Z, see the section-by-section analyses of Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(2) and (4) below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The issuance rules in EFTA and Regulation E apply to those prepaid cards that are not hybrid prepaid-credit cards even though the prepaid card accesses the credit feature at the time the prepaid card is issued.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Addition of a covered separate credit feature to an existing access device for a prepaid account.</em> The Bureau is amending existing § 1005.12(a)(2)(i) as proposed to provide that the issuance rules in TILA and Regulation Z govern the addition of a credit feature or plan to an accepted access device, including an access device for a prepaid account, that would make the access device into a credit card under Regulation Z.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The proposal would have added comment 12(a)-4 that would have explained that Regulation Z governs the addition of any credit feature or plan to an access device for a prepaid account where the access device also would be a credit card under Regulation Z. Proposed comment 12(a)-4 also would have stated that Regulation Z (existing § 1026.2(a)(20), proposed comment 2(a)(20)-2.ii) would have provided guidance on whether a program constitutes a credit plan, and that Regulation Z (existing § 1026.2(a)(15)(i), proposed comment 2(a)(15)-2) would have defined the term credit card and provided examples of cards or devices that are and are not credit cards. Consistent with the proposal, the Bureau is finalizing new comment 12(a)-4, with revisions to be consistent with new Regulation Z § 1026.61. New comment 12(a)-4 provides that Regulation Z governs the addition of a covered separate credit feature as that term is defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61 to an existing access device for a prepaid account. In this case, the access device becomes a hybrid prepaid-credit card under Regulation Z. A credit card feature may be added to a previously issued access device for a prepaid account only upon the consumer's application or specific request as described in final Regulation Z § 1026.12(a)(1) and only in compliance with new Regulation Z § 1026.61(c), as discussed above. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new Regulation Z § 1026.61 and a credit card under final Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth in the Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z section, the Bureau believes that credit card rules in Regulation Z, including the unsolicited issuance rules in final Regulation Z § 1026.12(a), should apply to hybrid prepaid-credit cards that access covered separate credit features. The Bureau believes that the more restrictive issuance rules in Regulation Z for issuance of a credit card are appropriate in this context. As discussed above, consistent with TILA section 132, final Regulation Z § 1026.12(a) provides that no credit card generally may be issued to any person on an unsolicited basis. This is in contrast to Regulation E which allows an access device to be provided to a consumer on an unsolicited basis if four enumerated situations are met.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes in particular that the addition of a covered separate credit feature to an accepted prepaid access device that would make the prepaid card into a hybrid prepaid-credit card causes a significant transformation with respect to a prepaid account. The Bureau believes that applying the Regulation Z unsolicited issuance rules to the addition of such a credit feature to a prepaid access device will help ensure that consumers must take affirmative steps to effect such a transformation by permitting financial institutions to link covered separate credit features to prepaid cards only in response to consumers' applications or requests that the credit features be linked. A card issuer also must comply with new Regulation Z § 1026.61(c) with respect to linking the covered separate credit feature to the prepaid card, as discussed above and in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z § 1026.61(c) below. New Regulation Z § 1026.61(c) will help ensure that consumers are fully aware of the implications of their decisions to link covered separate credit features to prepaid cards by prohibiting card issuers from linking a covered separate credit feature to a prepaid card until 30 days after the prepaid account has been registered.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Overdraft credit services defined in § 1005.17.</em> Existing § 1005.12(a)(1)(iii) provides that the issuance rules of EFTA and Regulation E govern the addition of an overdraft service, as defined in existing § 1005.17(a), to an accepted access device. Existing comment 12(a)-3 provides that the addition of an overdraft service, as that term is defined in existing § 1005.17(a), to an accepted access device does not constitute the addition of a credit feature subject to Regulation Z. Instead, the provisions of Regulation E apply, including the liability limitations (existing § 1005.6) and the requirement to obtain consumer consent to the service before any fees or charges for paying an overdraft may be assessed on the account (existing § 1005.17). The proposal would have provided that existing § 1005.12(a)(1)(iii) would not have applied to access devices for prepaid accounts. The proposal would have moved existing comment 12(a)-3 to proposed comment 12(a)-2 and would have revised it to provide that the comment does not apply to access devices for prepaid accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The final rule does not adopt the proposed changes to existing § 1005.12(a)(1)(iii). The final rule moves existing comment 12(a)-3 to new comment 12(a)-2 for organizational purposes, but does not amend the comment as proposed. The Bureau has not adopted the proposed amendments to existing § 1005.12(a)(1)(iii) and new comment 12(a)-2 because the Bureau believes such revisions are unnecessary in light of changes in other parts of the rule. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.17 below, the Bureau is adding § 1005.17(a)(4) to provide that an overdraft service does not include any payment of overdrafts pursuant to (1) a credit feature that is a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61; or (2) credit extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account that meets the conditions of new § 1026.61(a)(4). Thus, because a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card is not an overdraft service under final § 1005.17(a), existing § 1005.12(a)(1)(iii) and new comment 12(a)-2 related to the addition of an overdraft service as defined in final § 1005.17(a) to an access device are not applicable to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Rules Applicable to Limits on Liability for Unauthorized Use and to Billing Errors Procedures</title>
        <analysisParagraph/>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Current § 1005.6 generally sets forth provisions for when a consumer may be held liable, within the limitations described in existing § 1005.6(b), for an unauthorized EFT involving the consumer's account. Current § 1005.11 generally sets forth the procedures for resolving errors relating to EFTs involving a consumer's account. The Bureau is adding new § 1005.18(e) to set forth a consumer's liability for unauthorized EFTs and the procedures for investigating errors related to EFTs involving prepaid accounts. See generally the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(e) below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Relatedly, current Regulation Z § 1026.12(b) sets forth limits on the amount of liability that a credit card issuer may impose on a consumer for unauthorized use of a credit card. Current Regulation Z § 1026.13 generally sets forth error resolution procedures for billing errors that relate to extensions of credit that are made in connection with open-end credit plans or credit card accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Existing Regulation E § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv) currently provides guidance on how the provisions on limits on liability for unauthorized use and the provisions setting forth error resolution procedures under Regulations E and Z apply when credit is extended incident to an EFT. Specifically, current § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv) provides that EFTA and Regulation E govern a consumer's liability for an unauthorized EFT and the investigation of errors involving an extension of credit that occurs pursuant to an overdraft line of credit (under an agreement between the consumer and a financial institution to extend credit when the consumer's account is overdrawn or to maintain a specified minimum balance in the consumer's account), or under an overdraft service, as defined in existing § 1005.17(a).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Current comment 12(a)-1.i provides that for transactions involving access devices that also function as credit cards, whether Regulation E or Regulation Z applies depends on the nature of the transaction. For example, if the transaction solely involves an extension of credit, and does not include a debit to a checking account (or other consumer asset account), the liability limitations and error resolution requirements of Regulation Z apply. If the transaction debits a checking account only (with no credit extended), the provisions of Regulation E apply. If the transaction debits a checking account but also draws on an overdraft line of credit attached to the account, Regulation E's liability limitations apply, in addition to existing Regulation Z § 1026.13(d) and (g) (which apply because of the extension of credit associated with the overdraft feature on the checking account).<footnote ref="333">Existing Regulation Z § 1026.13(d) sets forth certain requirements that apply until a billing error is resolved. For example, existing Regulation Z § 1026.13(d)(1) provides that a consumer need not pay (and the creditor may not try to collect) any portion of any required payment that the consumer believes is related to a disputed amount reflected on the consumer's credit card bill. It also provides that if the cardholder has enrolled in an automatic payment plan, the card issuer shall not deduct any part of the disputed amount or related finance or other charges from the consumer's asset account if the consumer provides to the card issuer a billing error notice that the card issuer receives any time up to 3 business days before the scheduled payment date. Existing Regulation Z § 1026.13(g) sets forth requirements governing what a creditor must do if it determines that a consumer owes all or part of the disputed amount and related finance or other charges.</footnote>
             If a consumer's access device is also a credit card and the device is used to make unauthorized withdrawals from a checking account, but also is used to obtain unauthorized cash advances directly from a line of credit that is separate from the checking account, both Regulation E and Regulation Z apply. Current comment 12(a)-1.ii sets forth examples that illustrate these principles.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to limits on consumer liability for unauthorized use, existing § 1005.12(a) and comment 12(a)-1 are consistent with EFTA section 909(c), which applies EFTA's limits on liability for unauthorized use to transactions which involve both an unauthorized EFT and an extension of credit pursuant to an agreement between the consumer and the financial institution to extend such credit to the consumer in the event the consumer's account is overdrawn.<footnote ref="334">15 U.S.C. 1693g(c).</footnote>
             In adopting rules in 1980 to implement EFTA, the Board generally applied Regulation E's error resolution procedures to credit transactions that are incident to an EFT involving an extension of credit that occurs under an agreement between the consumer and a financial institution to extend credit when the consumer's account is overdrawn or to maintain a specified minimum balance in the consumer's account.<footnote ref="335">45 FR 8249, 8266 (Feb. 6, 1980).</footnote>
             In proposing these rules, the Board stated that the proposed rule would simplify procedures for financial institutions where an EFT results in both a debit to a consumer's account and a credit extension.<footnote ref="336">44 FR 25850, 25857 (May 3, 1979).</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons discussed in more detail in the section by section analysis of Regulation Z § 1026.13(i) below, the Bureau proposed to amend existing § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv) by moving the current language to proposed § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(A) and applying it to accounts other than prepaid accounts. The Bureau also proposed to add § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(B) to provide that with respect to a prepaid account, EFTA and Regulation E govern a consumer's liability for an unauthorized EFT and the investigation of errors involving an extension of credit, under a credit plan subject to Regulation Z subpart B, that is incident to an EFT when the consumer's prepaid account is overdrawn.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(B) that would have applied to credit in connection with a prepaid account was similar but not the same as proposed § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(A) that would have applied to accounts other than prepaid accounts. Like proposed § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(A), proposed § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(B) generally would have applied Regulation E's limits on liability for unauthorized use and error resolution procedures to transactions that are partially funded through an EFT using an access device and partially funded through credit under a plan that is accessed by an access device when the consumer's prepaid account is overdrawn.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>However, unlike proposed § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(A), proposed § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(B) would not have focused on whether there is an agreement between a consumer and a financial institution to extend credit when the consumer's prepaid account is overdrawn or to maintain a specified minimum balance in the consumer's prepaid account. Instead, proposed § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(B) would have focused on whether credit is extended under a “plan” when the consumer's prepaid account does not have sufficient funds to complete a transaction and the plan is subject to the provisions in Regulation Z subpart B. For example, under the proposal, a credit plan that is accessed by a prepaid card that is a credit card would have been subject to the provisions of subpart B. Under the proposal, a prepaid card would have been a credit card under Regulation Z even if the creditor retains discretion not to pay the credit transactions. Thus, proposed § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(B) would have focused on whether credit is extended under an “plan” that is subject to the provisions of subpart B, rather than whether there is an agreement between a consumer and a financial institution to extend credit when the consumer's account is overdrawn or to maintain a specified minimum balance in the consumer's account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The proposal would have added comment 12(a)-5.i to provide that for an account other than a prepaid account where credit is extended incident to an EFT under an agreement to extend overdraft credit between the consumer and the financial institution, Regulation E's liability limitations and error resolution provisions would have applied, in addition to § 1026.13(d) and (g) of Regulation Z (which apply because of the extension of credit associated with the overdraft feature on the asset account). With respect to an account other than a prepaid account, credit that is incident to an EFT that is not extended under an agreement between the consumer and the financial institution where the financial institution agrees to extend credit is governed solely by the error resolution procedures in Regulation E and Regulation Z § 1026.13(d) and (g) do not apply. With respect to a prepaid account where credit is extended under a credit plan that is subject to Regulation Z subpart B, Regulation E's liability limitations and error resolution provisions would have applied, in addition to Regulation Z § 1026.13(d) and (g) (which apply because of the extension of credit associated with the overdraft feature on the asset account). In addition, proposed comment 12(a)-5.i would have provided that a credit plan is subject to Regulation Z subpart B if it is accessed by an access device that is a credit card under Regulation Z or if it is open-end credit under Regulation Z. An access device for a prepaid account would not have been a credit card if the access device only accesses credit that is not subject to any finance charge, as defined in Regulation Z § 1026.4, or any fee described in Regulation Z § 1026.4(c), and is not payable by written agreement in more than four installments. Proposed comment 12(a)-5.i also would have provided that credit incident to an EFT under a credit plan that only can be accessed by an access device for a prepaid account that is not a credit card is not subject to Regulation Z subpart B and is governed solely by the error resolution procedures in Regulation E because the credit plan would not have accessed by a credit card and the plan would not have been open-end credit. In this case, Regulation Z § 1026.13(d) and (g) would not have applied.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, existing comment 12(a)-1.i provides guidance on how the principles in existing § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv) apply to transactions involving access devices that are credit cards under Regulation Z. The proposal would have moved existing comment 12(a)-1.i to proposed comment 12(a)-5.ii and made revisions to make clear that this guidance applies to prepaid cards that would have been credit cards under the proposal. The proposal also would have made technical revisions to proposed comment 12(a)-5.ii for clarity.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Existing comment 12(a)-1.ii.A through D provide examples of how the principles described in existing comment 12(a)-1.i relate to transactions involving access devices that also function as credit cards under Regulation Z. Specifically, these examples describe different types of transactions that involve a debit card that also is a credit card and discuss whether Regulation E or Regulation Z's liability limitations and error resolution requirements apply to those transactions. The proposal would have moved existing comment 12(a)-1.ii.A through D to proposed comment 12(a)-5.iii.A through D respectively. The proposal also would have revised the examples in proposed comment 12(a)-5.iii.A through D to clarify that these examples relate to a credit card that also is an access device that draws on a consumer's checking account, and would have made technical revisions to clarify the intent of the examples. No substantive changes would have been intended with these revisions. The proposal also would have added proposed comment 12(a)-5.iii.E that would have provided that the same principles in proposed comment 12(a)-5.iii.A through D apply to prepaid cards that would have been credit cards under the proposal.</analysisParagraph>

        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive any specific comments on this proposal to amend existing § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv) related to applicability of limits on liability for unauthorized use and error resolution provisions under Regulations E and Z.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is amending existing § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv) and adding new § 1005.12(a)(2)(iii) to be consistent with new Regulation Z § 1026.61.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z § 1026.13(i) below, consistent with the proposal, the Bureau is amending existing § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv) by moving the current language to § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(A) and applying it to transactions that do not involve prepaid accounts. The Bureau also is adding new § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(B) to provide that with respect to transactions that involve a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as those terms are defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61, EFTA and Regulation E govern a consumer's liability for an unauthorized EFT and the investigation of errors involving an extension of credit that is incident to an EFT that occurs when the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses both funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account and a credit extension from the credit feature with respect to a particular transaction. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new Regulation Z § 1026.61 and a credit card under final Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.

        <analysisParagraph>As discussed below, the final rule also adds new § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(C), and (D), and (2)(iii) to provide guidance on whether Regulation E or Regulation Z governs the consumer's liability for unauthorized use and the investigation of errors with respect to transactions made by prepaid cards that are not hybrid prepaid-credit cards as defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 12(a)-5.i would have provided guidance on the provisions in both proposed § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(A) and (B). As discussed in more detail below, the final rule retains the guidance related to credit extended in connection with prepaid accounts in new comment 12(a)-5.i with revisions to be consistent with new Regulation Z § 1026.61. As discussed in more detail below, the final rule moves guidance related to other types of credit from proposed comment 12(a)-5.i to new comment 12(a)-5.ii and revises it to be consistent with new Regulation Z § 1026.61. Consistent with the proposal, the final rule also moves current comment 12(a)-1.i and ii to new comment 12(a)-5.iii and iv and revises this comment to be consistent with new Regulation Z § 1026.61.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consistent with the proposal, with respect to transactions that involve a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as those terms are defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61, new § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(B) does not focus on whether there is an agreement between a consumer and a financial institution to extend credit when the consumer's prepaid account is overdrawn or to maintain a specified minimum balance in the consumer's prepaid account. Under the final rule, whether a prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card does not depend on whether there is an agreement between a consumer and a financial institution to extend credit when the consumer's prepaid account is overdrawn or to maintain a specified minimum balance in the consumer's prepaid account. Instead, under the final rule, a prepaid card is a credit card under Regulation Z when it is a “hybrid prepaid-credit card” as defined in Regulation Z. In particular, new Regulation Z comment 61(a)(1)-1 provides that a prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card if the prepaid card can access credit from a covered separate credit feature even if, for example: (1) The person that can extend the credit does not agree in writing to extend the credit; (2) the person retains discretion not to extend the credit; or (3) the person does not extend the credit once the consumer has exceeded a certain amount of credit.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Thus, consistent with the proposal, new § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(B) focuses on transactions that involve a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as those terms are defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61, where an extension of credit that is incident to an EFT occurs when the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses both funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account and a credit extension from the credit feature with respect to a particular transaction. These are the situations in which Regulations Z and E would overlap with respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards. New § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(B) provides that in these circumstances, EFTA and Regulation E generally govern a consumer's liability for an unauthorized EFT and the investigation of errors with respect to these transactions. Regulation Z's provisions related to a consumer's liability for unauthorized transactions and error resolution procedures generally do not apply, except for existing Regulation Z § 1026.13(d) and (g) that apply to the credit portion of the transaction.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(B) and new comment 12(a)-5.i and iii through iv are discussed first. New § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(C) and (D), and (2)(iii) are discussed second. New § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(A) and new comment 12(a)-5.ii are discussed third.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Transactions involving covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards.</em> As discussed above, new § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(B) provides that with respect to transactions that involve a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as those terms are defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61, EFTA and Regulation E govern a consumer's liability for an unauthorized EFT and the investigation of errors involving an extension of credit incident to an EFT that occurs when the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses both funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account and a credit extension from the credit feature with respect to a particular transaction.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 12(a)-5.i would have provided guidance on the provisions in both proposed § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(A) and (B). In the final rule, the guidance related to credit extended in connection with prepaid accounts is retained in new comment 12(a)-5.i with revisions to be consistent with new Regulation Z § 1026.61. As discussed in more detail below, the final rule moves guidance related to other types of credit from proposed comment 12(a)-5.i to new comment 12(a)-5.ii with revisions.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Under the final rule, new comment 12(a)-5.i provides that with respect to a transaction that involves a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as those terms are defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61, where credit is extended under a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card that is incident to an EFT when the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses both funds in the asset feature of a prepaid account and credit extensions from the credit feature with respect to a particular transaction, Regulation E's liability limitations and error resolution provisions apply to the transaction, in addition to existing Regulation Z § 1026.13(d) and (g) (which apply because of the extension of credit associated with the covered separate credit feature).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, existing comment 12(a)-1.i provides guidance on how the principles in existing § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv) apply to transactions involving access devices that are credit cards under Regulation Z. The proposal would have moved existing comment 12(a)-1.i to proposed comment 12(a)-5.ii and made revisions to make clear that this guidance applies to prepaid cards that would have been credit cards under the proposal. The proposal also would have made technical revisions to proposed comment 12(a)-5.ii for clarity; no substantive changes were intended. The final rule moves current comment 12(a)-1.i to new comment 12(a)-5.iii and adopts this comment consistent with the proposal, with additional technical revisions for clarity. New comment 12(a)-5.iii provides guidance on how the principles in final § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv) apply to transactions involving access devices that are credit cards under Regulation Z, including hybrid prepaid-credit cards that access covered separate credit features. New comment 12(a)-5.iii provides that for transactions involving access devices that also function as credit cards under Regulation Z, whether Regulation E or Regulation Z applies depends on the nature of the transaction. For example, if the transaction solely involves an extension of credit, and does not access funds in a consumer asset account, such as a checking account or prepaid account, the liability limitations and error resolution requirements of Regulation Z apply. If the transaction accesses funds in an asset account only (with no credit extended), the provisions of Regulation E apply. If the transaction access funds in an asset account but also involves an extension of credit under an overdraft credit feature subject to Regulation Z attached to the account, Regulation E's liability limitations and error resolution provisions apply, in addition to existing Regulation Z § 1026.13(d) and (g) (which apply because of the extension of credit associated with the overdraft feature on the asset account). If a consumer's access device is also a credit card and the device is used to make unauthorized withdrawals from an asset account, but also is used to obtain unauthorized cash advances directly from a credit feature that is subject to Regulation Z that is separate from the asset account, both Regulation E and Regulation Z apply.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Existing examples in comment 12(a)-1.ii.A through D provide examples of how the principles in existing comment 12(a)-1.i relate to transactions involving access devices that also function as credit cards under Regulation Z. Specifically, these examples describe different types of transactions that involve a debit card that also is a credit card and discuss whether Regulation E or Regulation Z's liability limitations and error resolution requirements apply to those transactions. The proposal would have moved existing comment 12(a)-1.ii.A through D to proposed comment 12(a)-5.iii.A through D respectively and would have made several revisions as discussed above.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The final rule moves the existing examples from existing comment 12(a)-1.ii.A through D to new comment 12(a)-5.iv.A through D respectively. Consistent with the proposal, the final rule also revises the examples in new comment 12(a)-5.iv.A through D to clarify that these examples relate to a credit card that also is an access device that draws on a consumer's checking account, and makes technical revisions to clarify the intent of the examples. No substantive changes are intended with these revisions. Consistent with the proposal, the final rule also adds new comment 12(a)-5.iv.E that provides that the same principles in new comment 12(a)-5.iv.A through D apply to an access device for a prepaid account that also is a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a covered separate credit feature under Regulation Z § 1026.61. New comment 12(a)-5.iv.E also provides a cross-reference to final Regulation Z § 1026.13(i)(2) and new comment 13(i)-4 that deals with the interaction between Regulations E and Z with respect to billing error resolution for transactions that involve covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Prepaid cards that are not hybrid prepaid-credit cards.</em> As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z § 1026.61 below, the Bureau has decided to exclude prepaid cards from being covered as credit cards under Regulation Z when they access certain specified types of credit. First, under new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii), a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a “non-covered separate credit feature,” which means that the separate credit feature either (1) cannot be accessed in the course of a prepaid card transaction to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers, or (2) is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. Second, under new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(4), a prepaid card also is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card when the prepaid card accesses incidental credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account where the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit. A prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new Regulation Z § 1026.61 or a credit card under final Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) when it accesses credit from these types of credit features. For more detailed explanations of when prepaid cards are not credit cards under Regulation Z, see the section-by-section analyses of Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(2) and (4) below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the final rule adds new § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(C), (D), and (2)(iii) to provide guidance on whether Regulation E or Regulation Z governs the consumer's liability for unauthorized use and the investigation of errors with respect to transactions made by prepaid cards that are not hybrid prepaid-credit cards as defined in Regulation Z § 1026.61. New § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(C) provides that Regulation E governs the consumer's liability for an unauthorized EFT and the investigation of errors with respect to transactions that involves credit extended through a negative balance to the asset feature of a prepaid account that meets the conditions set forth in Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(4). New comment 12(a)-5.i clarifies that § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(C) provides that with respect to transactions that involves credit extended through a negative balance to the asset feature of a prepaid account that meets the conditions set forth in Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(4), these transactions are governed solely by the liability limitations and error resolution procedures in Regulation E, and Regulation Z does not apply.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(D) provides that with respect to transactions involving a prepaid account and a non-covered separate credit feature as defined in Regulation Z § 1026.61, Regulation E governs the consumer's liability for an unauthorized EFT and the investigation of errors with respect to transactions that access the prepaid account, as applicable. New § 1005.12(a)(2)(iii) provides that with respect to transactions involving a prepaid account and a non-covered separate credit feature as defined in Regulation Z § 1026.61, Regulation Z governs the consumer's liability for unauthorized use and the investigation of errors with respect to transactions that access the non-covered separate credit feature, as applicable. New comment 12(a)-5.i clarifies that § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(D) and (2)(iii), taken together, provide that with respect to transactions involving a prepaid account and a non-covered separate credit feature as defined in Regulation Z § 1026.61, a financial institution must comply with Regulation E's liability limitations and error resolution procedures with respect to transactions that access the prepaid account as applicable, and the creditor must comply with Regulation Z's liability limitations and error resolution procedures with respect to transactions that access the non-covered separate credit feature, as applicable.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, EFTA section 909(c) provides that EFTA's limits on liability for unauthorized use apply to transactions which involve both an unauthorized EFT and an extension of credit pursuant to an agreement between the consumer and the financial institution to extend such credit to the consumer in the event the consumer's account is overdrawn.<footnote ref="337">15 U.S.C. 1693g(c).</footnote>
             The Bureau believes, however, that EFTA section 909(c) does not apply to transactions that access a non-covered separate credit feature. Non-covered separate credit features only include overdraft credit features with respect to prepaid accounts provided by unrelated third-party creditors other than the prepaid account issuer, its affiliates, or its business partners. Thus, a non-covered separate credit feature could not be offered by a financial institution that is offering overdraft on the prepaid account. For purposes of EFTA section 909(c), the Bureau believes extending credit is reasonably interpreted only to apply where the financial institution is itself the creditor, and thus would not encompass a situation where the financial institution who is the prepaid account issuer would be accessing credit, pursuant to an agreement with the consumer, from the consumer's non-covered separate credit feature. Thus, as explained in new comment 12(a)-5.i, new § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(D) and (2)(iii), taken together, provide that with respect to transactions involving a prepaid account and a non-covered separate credit feature as defined in Regulation Z § 1026.61, a financial institution must comply with Regulation E's liability limitations and error resolution procedures with respect to transactions that access the prepaid account as applicable, and the creditor must comply with Regulation Z's liability limitations and error resolution procedures with respect to transactions that access the non-covered separate credit feature, as applicable. See also the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z § 1026.13(i) below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Transactions that do not involve prepaid accounts.</em> As discussed above, final § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(A) provides that EFTA and Regulation E generally govern a consumer's liability for an unauthorized EFT and the investigation of errors with respect to transactions that (1) do not involve a prepaid account; and (2) involve an extension of credit that is incident to an EFT that occurs under an agreement between the consumer and a financial institution to extend credit when the consumer's account is overdrawn or to maintain a specified minimum balance in the consumer's account, or under an overdraft service, as defined in final § 1005.17(a).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, proposed comment 12(a)-5.i would have provided guidance on the provisions in both proposed § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(A) and (B). In the final rule, the proposed guidance related to credit extended in connection with prepaid accounts is retained in new comment 12(a)-5.i with revisions. The final rule moves guidance related to other types of credit from proposed comment 12(a)-5.i to new comment 12(a)-5.ii and revises it to be consistent with new Regulation Z § 1026.61.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The final rule adds new comment 12(a)-5.ii to provide guidance with respect to accounts other than prepaid accounts. Specifically, new comment 12(a)-5.ii provides that with respect to an account (other than a prepaid account) where credit is extended incident to an EFT under an agreement to extend overdraft credit between the consumer and the financial institution, Regulation E's liability limitations and error resolution provisions apply to the transaction, in addition to existing Regulation Z § 1026.13(d) and (g) (which apply because of the extension of credit associated with the overdraft feature on the asset account). Access devices that access accounts other than prepaid accounts are credit cards under Regulation Z when there is an agreement by the financial institution to extend credit. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> final Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(15)(iv) and existing Regulation Z comments 2(a)(15)-2.i.B and ii.A.

      <title>12(b) Preemption of Inconsistent State Laws</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>In 2013, the Bureau published a final determination as to whether certain laws of Maine and Tennessee relating to unclaimed gift cards are inconsistent with and preempted by EFTA and Regulation E.<footnote ref="338">78 FR 24386, 24391 (Apr. 25, 2013).</footnote>
             The Bureau stated that it had no basis for concluding that the provisions at issue in Maine's unclaimed property law relating to gift cards are inconsistent with, or therefore preempted by, Federal law. The Bureau did determine, however, that one provision in Tennessee's unclaimed property law relating to gift cards is inconsistent with, and therefore preempted by, Federal law. The Bureau's final determination stated that the determination would also be reflected in the commentary accompanying Regulation E.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to add a summary of its preemption determination with respect to Tennessee's unclaimed property law as comment 12(b)-4. Proposed comment 12(b)-4 would have stated that the Bureau had determined that a provision in the State law of Tennessee is preempted by the Federal law, effective April 25, 2013. It would have further stated that, specifically, section 66-29-116 of Tennessee's Uniform Disposition of Unclaimed (Personal) Property Act is preempted to the extent that it permits gift certificates, store gift cards, and stored-value cards, as defined in § 1005.20(a), to be declined at the point-of-sale sooner than the gift certificates, store gift cards, or stored value cards and their underlying funds are permitted to expire under § 1005.20(e).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Existing comment 12(b)-2 states that the Bureau recognizes State law preemption determinations made by the Board prior to July 21, 2011, unless and until the Bureau makes and publishes any contrary determination. The Bureau proposed to make this statement into a standalone comment in proposed comment 12(b)-2 under the heading <em data-original="E-03">Preemption determinations generally.</em> The Bureau proposed to renumber the remainder of existing comment 12(b)-2 as proposed comment 12(b)-3, to make the heading for that comment <em data-original="E-03">Preemption determination—Michigan</em> for clarity, and to update proposed comments 12(b)-3.i through iv to provide full citations to the preempted Michigan law at issue therein, which appear in chapter 488 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. Additionally, the Bureau proposed adding language in proposed comment 12(b)-3.iv to clarify that the preemption of sections 488.17 and 488.18 of Michigan law does not apply to transfers of $15 or less, which, pursuant to existing § 1005.9(e), are not subject to § 1005.9. Section 1005.9(e) (then § 205.9(e)) was added by the Board in 2007 to eliminate the requirement to provide terminal receipts for transactions of $15 or less.<footnote ref="339">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 72 FR 36589 (July 5, 2007).</footnote>

        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received no comments regarding the proposed revisions to the commentary for § 1005.12(b). The Bureau did, however, receive comments from a consumer group and the office of a State Attorney General urging the Bureau to clarify that this final rule does not preempt stronger State laws with respect to payroll, student, prison, and government benefit accounts and to acknowledge that State laws may require additional disclosures and obligations not required by this final rule. These commenters specifically referenced the Illinois payroll card law, which they stated provides certain employee protections that are not contemplated by this rule, and recommended that the Bureau emphasize that employers may have additional obligations and restrictions under State law.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also received a comment from a payment network, urging the Bureau to expressly provide that all State law requirements that are inconsistent with the requirements of the Bureau's final rule governing prepaid accounts are preempted. The commenter stated that inconsistent State requirements would detract from any required Federal disclosures and add costs to prepaid programs that ultimately will be borne by consumers. The commenter specifically expressed concern regarding State laws governing disclosures of fees or terms because, it said, such laws will frustrate the goals of consistent disclosure and comparison shopping.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is finalizing comments 12(b)-2 and -3 generally as proposed, with several minor modifications for clarity. The Bureau is also finalizing comment 12(b)-4 as proposed, but in lieu of the proposed reference to “stored value cards,” the Bureau is using “general-use prepaid cards” in final comment 12(b)-4.i for consistency with § 1005.20(a). The Bureau considered the comments discussed above from the consumer group, the office of a State Attorney General, and the payment network, but does not believe that a revision to the regulatory text or commentary is necessary. EFTA section 922 makes clear that it does not preempt State laws except to the extent those laws are inconsistent with EFTA (and then only to the extent of that inconsistency). It further provides that “[a] State law is not inconsistent with [EFTA] if the protection such law affords any consumer is greater than the protection afforded by [EFTA].” The Bureau acknowledges that State laws may require additional disclosures and obligations not required by this final rule, and agrees that financial institutions and other persons involved in prepaid account programs, including employers, should be aware of additional obligations and restrictions under State law.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth below, and in the absence of comments opposing the prominence and size requirements regarding the short form disclosure for multiple service plans, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii)(D), renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(7)(ii)(D), with certain modifications. The Bureau generally is adopting the size requirements for the multiple service plan short form disclosure as proposed but with additional prominence and size requirements to address the redesigned short form disclosure for multiple service plans and, upon further consideration, to include specifications that were not addressed in the proposed rule. The Bureau has made technical modifications to the rule for conformity and clarity.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The design structure and increased density and complexity of the short form disclosure for multiple service plans, as compared to the general short form disclosure, requires more simplified uniform size requirements. Thus, the final rule requires that, when providing a short form disclosure for multiple service plans pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), the fee headings required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (iv) must appear in bold-faced type. With this requirement, the disclosure of these fees will somewhat mimic the focus on the top-line disclosures in the general short form. The information required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (xiii) must appear in a minimum type size of seven points (or nine pixels), except the following must appear in a minimum type size of six points (or eight pixels) and appear in no larger a type size than what is used for the information required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (xiii): Text used to distinguish each of the two-tier fees required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(iii) and (v); text used to explain that the fee required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(vi) applies “per call,” where applicable; text used to explain the conditions that trigger an inactivity fee pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(vii); and text used to distinguish that fees required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) and (vii) apply monthly or for the applicable time period.</analysisParagraph>

        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed, in general, a nine-month effective date for its rulemaking on prepaid accounts. Specifically, proposed § 1005.18(h)(1) would have stated that, except as provided in proposed § 1005.18(h)(2), the requirements of EFTA and Regulation E, as modified by proposed § 1005.18, would have applied to prepaid accounts nine months following the publication of the Bureau's final rule in the <em data-original="E-04">Federal Register</em>.  This would have included the disclosure requirements in proposed § 1005.18(b) and (f)(2), and would have applied to prepaid account packaging, access devices, and other physical materials that are manufactured, printed, or otherwise prepared in connection with a prepaid account on or after nine months. Thus, proposed § 1005.18(h)(1) would have generally made applicable to all prepaid accounts the requirements of EFTA and Regulation E, as modified by the provisions of proposed § 1005.18, including those governing disclosures, access to prepaid account information, limited liability and error resolution, among others, after nine months. For instance, the new disclosure requirements would have applied immediately at the nine-month mark for disclosures and other information made available to consumers online or by telephone.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>However, this first proposed effective date would not have required immediate destruction or removal of previously printed materials because it would have only required packages, cards, and other materials printed on or after the nine month date to comply with the rule's disclosure requirements in proposed § 1005.18(b) and (f)(2). Instead, the Bureau proposed a delayed effective date for certain additional packaging-related changes, which would have been 12 months following the publication of the final rule in the <em data-original="E-04">Federal Register</em>.  This second date, in proposed § 1005.18(h)(2), would have required full compliance with the rule's disclosure requirements and would have prohibited the offering, sale, or otherwise making available of prepaid accounts and related packaging, access devices, or other printed materials without such disclosures. As a result, by 12 months, financial institutions and their third-party distribution agents would have had to remove from retail store shelves and other distribution channels any prepaid accounts with disclosures not fully in compliance with the rule.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For prepaid account packaging, access devices, and other printed materials created prior to this first effective date, the Bureau believed that nothing it proposed would trigger requirements under existing Regulation E to provide a change-in-terms notice insofar as the proposal would not have required increased fees, liability, or fewer types of available EFTs for consumers.<footnote ref="519">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; § 1005.8(a) and 12 CFR 1030.5(a)(1).</footnote>
             If, however, financial institutions wished to avail themselves of the more limited error resolution or limited liability requirements for existing unregistered prepaid accounts where their existing terms provide greater protections, the Bureau noted that a change-in-terms notice might be required.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also noted that, independent of the proposed rule, financial institutions that wish to make substantive changes to prepaid account fees or terms are often required by other laws to remove from retail stores and other distribution channels prepaid account packaging, access devices, and other printed materials that their changes render inaccurate, and to provide notice of those changes to consumers with existing prepaid accounts. Such laws may include operative state consumer protection and contract laws.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received many comments from industry, including trade associations, issuing banks, credit unions, program managers, payment networks, a payment processor, and a law firm writing on behalf of a coalition of prepaid issuers, arguing that the proposed nine- and 12-month compliance periods would be insufficient to implement the changes that would be required under the proposal.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>These commenters argued that, due to the perceived complexity of the proposal, industry would need more time to review the requirements of the final rule and implement extensive system and operational changes, which would include, among other things, revising internal procedures and training staff. Commenters recommended a range of time periods, starting at 12 months but generally converging around 18 to 24 months. One trade association, however, said that it found the proposed nine- and 12-month effective dates reasonable. Commenters stated that the rule will affect the entire prepaid industry at the same time and will require coordination and planning among all industry participants, including third-party vendors. They explained that high demand for packaging manufacturers would strain resources and suppliers and cause significant delays in the production process. Industry commenters also expressed concern about the costs and waste associated with pulling and replacing packaging with non-compliant disclosures. These commenters stated that a longer compliance period would ensure that industry has time to comprehensively implement the required changes, with minimal business disruption, and avoid the destruction of millions of card packages. These commenters also urged the Bureau to consider holiday season system freezes and peak time demands when setting an effective date for the final rule, as well as impacts related to the roll-out of EMV-enabled cards and POS terminals. These commenters explained that, as an industry practice, various entities involved in the prepaid value chain observe a “freeze period” during which no major system updates should take place, often due to increased volumes during certain times of the year. The exact periods may differ for financial institutions, program managers, data processors, and retail stores, but combined generally span October through April.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several commenters explained that industry would need more time than the Bureau proposed to implement necessary system and operational changes, in order to comply with specific aspects of the proposal. For example, with respect to disclosures, several commenters stated that the proposed requirements would, among other things, require industry to design new disclosures that would appear on packaging materials, which would need to be newly produced, and on Web sites and mobile applications, which would need to be redesigned and reprogrammed. These commenters explained that providing disclosures prior to the acquisition of government benefit accounts, payroll card accounts, and campus cards would require revisions to current procedures, training of third parties and employees, enhanced monitoring of third-party practices, and the removal and replacement of preprinted card stock. To help mitigate the costs that would be associated with destroying unused packaging material, several credit unions and credit union trade associations urged the Bureau to consider a compliance period driven by the expiration date on the card stock. These commenters explained that some credit unions purchase card stock four years in advance of the last expiration date, as cards are sold with a three-year expiration date range. One industry trade association suggested that the Bureau grant a safe harbor for any prepaid account packaging manufactured in the ordinary course of business within 90 days of publication of the final rule in the <em data-original="E-04">Federal Register</em>.  Another industry trade association suggested that the Bureau grant an exemption for cards issued before a certain date, allow financial institutions to exhaust the card stock and notify consumers in a reasonable manner that additional rights apply to the existing cards, or impose a “manufacture date” after which all cards manufactured must comply with the final rule. A payment network suggested that the Bureau grant a safe harbor and allow financial institutions to keep existing physical cards stocked at retail locations and notify consumers of any changes either by sending change-in-terms notices or by obtaining consumer consent upon registration. This commenter added that this approach would both cure outdated pricing on card packaging and also allow financial institutions to introduce new features that have a fee.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Regarding the proposed access to account information requirements, several commenters stated that displaying the proposed summary totals of fees, deposits, and debits for the prior calendar month and the calendar year to date in proposed § 1005.18(c)(4) would require financial institutions to map the fee information for each cardholder, redesign online transaction history pages, and change the formatting for paper statements. With respect to the proposed requirement to provide 18 months of account transaction history under the periodic statement alternative in proposed § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) and (iii), several industry commenters stated that making the changes necessary to provide 18 months of account history nine months after publication of the final rule would be problematic and time-consuming. These commenters explained that financial institutions may not currently have 18 months of account transaction history for prepaid accounts and, if they do, older information is likely archived and not easily accessible. These commenters also explained that financial institutions would need to redesign systems to be capable of supporting 18 months of account transaction history and would need to train staff on the new systems and capabilities.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several commenters stated that submitting prepaid account agreements to the Bureau and posting agreements on the issuer's Web site pursuant to proposed § 1005.19(b) and (c), respectively, would require financial institutions to create a process for updating agreements on a quarterly basis, develop a periodic monitoring process to ensure accuracy of these agreements, create a location on their Web sites for the posting of agreements, and develop a process for maintaining inventory of these agreements.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Regarding the proposed changes to the treatment of overdraft services and certain other credit plans for prepaid accounts, several industry commenters explained that, to avoid coverage under the rule as proposed for inadvertent overdrafts such as those resulting from force pay transactions, financial institutions would either need to block authorization requests where the final transaction amount is not known in advance (such as gasoline purchases at automated fuel dispensers) and require cardholders to pay in advance for every transaction that could potentially result in an inadvertent overdraft, or add transaction audit steps for merchant-initiated transactions to ensure that merchants have a current, accurate authorization before any prepaid card transaction is processed. One program manager that currently offers overdraft services on some of its prepaid accounts requested a compliance period of at least 24 months to develop and test new systems for delivering the required disclosures (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> periodic statements for prepaid cards that are also deemed a credit card) and to perform underwriting for complying with ability-to-pay requirements under Regulation Z. For existing prepaid accounts that offer overdraft services, this commenter urged the Bureau to establish at least a 6-month period during which overdraft services could continue to be offered without being subject to the final rule, so that consumers could be given sufficient notice regarding the changes to allow them to make alternative financial arrangements as necessary. This commenter explained, however, that if the Bureau established an effective date for a period longer than nine months (such as 24 months), the 6-month wind-down period would be less important.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several commenters suggested modifications to the proposed effective dates that they believed would reduce the potential compliance burden on industry. A few industry commenters suggested a longer compliance period for products sold at retail and for portions of the rule that require system changes. One payment network and a law firm writing on behalf of a coalition of prepaid issuers urged the Bureau to allow consumers to continue using their existing prepaid cards until the card expires, which the payment network believed would allow financial institutions to avoid destroying millions of cards consistent with the spirit of what is commonly referred to as the “ECO Card Act.” <footnote ref="520">Public Law 111-209 (2010). This act amended the statutory date by which the Board's regulations implementing of the gift card provisions of the Credit CARD Act were required to become effective. The Credit CARD Act had originally called for an effective date of August 22, 2010 for the Gift Card Rule; the ECO Card Act, which was enacted on July 27, 2010, extended that effective date. Specifically, the ECO Card Act extended the effective date to January 31, 2011 for gift certificates, store gift cards, and general-use prepaid cards that were produced prior to April 1, 2010, provided certain conditions (including regarding in-store signage) were met. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See also&lt;/em&gt; 75 FR 66644 (Oct. 29, 2010); Press Release, Network Branded Prepaid Card Ass'n, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Senate Passed, By Unanimous Consent, NBPCA Backed H.R. 5502, the ECO Card Act&lt;/em&gt; (July 14, 2010), available at &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.nbpca.com/en/News-Room/Press-Releases/ECO-Card-Act.aspx&lt;/em&gt; (stating that passage of the ECO Card Act granted industry “a meaningful period to transition until January 31, 2011 thereby avoiding the needless destruction of hundreds of millions of cards and packaging that would have resulted in millions of dollars in losses . . . .”)</footnote>
             For existing vendor contracts that may be in violation of the final rule, one state employment department and an industry commenter urged the Bureau to either grandfather in existing contracts until they expire, or provide a reasonable timeframe in which to amend or rebid the contracts. One industry commenter requested that the final rule clearly state when revisions to Regulation Z will become effective to avoid confusion for financial institutions that are also subject to 32 CFR part 232, the regulation implementing the MLA,<footnote ref="521">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 79 FR 58602 (Sept. 29, 2014). The DOD subsequently finalized this rulemaking, which became effective on October 1, 2015 (compliance required by October 3, 2016). &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 80 FR 43560 (July 22, 2015) and part II.C above.</footnote>
             which the DOD proposed shortly before the Bureau released its proposed rulemaking on prepaid accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received few comments from consumer groups regarding this portion of the proposal. One consumer group suggested that the Bureau could allow financial institutions to implement the access to account information requirements set forth in § 1005.18(c) on a rolling basis. This commenter explained that under such scenario, a financial institution would not be required to provide account information from prior to the final rule's effective date, but instead could begin accumulating it on the effective date until the financial institution has the information needed for the full time periods required by the rule.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Upon consideration of the comments received, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to provide a longer implementation period in light of some of the logistical issues raised by industry. The Bureau believes it is important to ensure that industry has sufficient time to implement the changes required by this final rule, but it is also important not to delay the important consumer protections the rule sets forth any longer than necessary. The Bureau has thus extended the general effective date of this final rule from the proposed nine months following the publication of the rule in the <em data-original="E-04">Federal Register</em> to approximately 12 months following issuance of the final rule. The Bureau has also made a number of modifications and accommodations in the rule to address particular concerns raised by commenters.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Specifically, the Bureau's final rule on prepaid accounts, as set forth herein, will generally become effective on October 1, 2017, with a few exceptions as discussed below. Under this final rule (unlike the proposal), financial institutions are not required to pull and replace prepaid account access devices and packaging materials with non-compliant disclosures that were produced in the normal course of business prior to October 1, 2017. The final rule also includes specific provisions addressing how financial institutions should provide notices of changes and updated initial disclosures in certain circumstances. Further, this final rule includes an accommodation for financial institutions that do not have readily available the data necessary to comply fully with the periodic statement alternative requirements in final § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) and (iii) or the summary totals of fees requirement in final § 1005.18(c)(5) as of October 1, 2017. In addition, the requirement to submit prepaid account agreements to the Bureau pursuant to final § 1005.19(b) is delayed until October 1, 2018.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has included several provisions in regulatory text and commentary to make clearer these specific modifications to the rule's general October 1, 2017 effective date. Specifically, final § 1005.18(h) establishes a general effective date as well as special transition rules for certain disclosure provisions. The delayed effective date for submission of prepaid account agreements to the Bureau is addressed in § 1005.19(f).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that nothing in this final rule changes the existing requirements for payroll card accounts or government benefit accounts prior to October 1, 2017. Financial institutions offering payroll card accounts or government benefit accounts must comply with all existing requirements applicable to those accounts under EFTA and Regulation E until October 1, 2017. Beginning October 1, 2017, financial institutions must comply with modified requirements in subpart A of Regulation E for such accounts as set forth in this final rule.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.18(h)(1) provides that except as provided in § 1005.18(h)(2) and (3), the requirements of the final rule apply to prepaid accounts beginning October 1, 2017. Final § 1005.18(h)(2)(i) establishes an exception for non-compliant disclosures on existing prepaid account access devices and packaging materials to eliminate the proposed pull and replace requirement. In return, final § 1005.18(h)(2)(ii) requires that financial institutions provide notices of certain changes and updated initial disclosures to consumers who acquire prepaid accounts on or after October 1, 2017 via non-compliant packaging materials printed prior to the effective date. Final § 1005.18(h)(2)(iii) clarifies the requirements for providing notice of changes to consumers who acquired prepaid accounts before October 1, 2017. Final § 1005.18(h)(2)(iv) facilitates the delivery of the notices of changes and updated initial disclosures for prepaid accounts governed by § 1005.18(h)(2)(ii) or (iii). Finally, § 1005.18(h)(3) sets forth the accommodation for financial institutions that do not have readily accessible the data necessary to comply fully with the periodic statement alternative or summary totals of fees requirements. These provisions are each discussed in detail below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">18(h)(1).</em> Final § 1005.18(h)(1) explains, that except as provided in § 1005.18(h)(2) and (3), the requirements of subpart A of Regulation E, as modified by final § 1005.18, apply to prepaid accounts as defined in final § 1005.2(b)(3), including government benefit accounts subject to final § 1005.15, beginning October 1, 2017, which is approximately 12 months following the Bureau's issuance of this final rule.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes 12 months is an appropriate compliance period for this final rule in general, particularly given the modifications and accommodations discussed below, and should provide financial institutions sufficient time to review the requirements of the final rule, implement the necessary system and operational changes, and for coordination and planning among all industry participants. The Bureau has specified an October 1, 2017 effective date for the final rule in general, rather than making it contingent on publication of the final rule in the <em data-original="E-04">Federal Register</em>,  for several reasons. The Bureau believes an October 1, 2017 effective date will not interfere with holiday season system freezes and peak time demands, which commenters stated generally spans October through April, and setting a date certain in this context will provide more clarity and comfort to industry in this regard. (In response to related concerns raised by commenters, the Bureau believes that, given the modification to eliminate the proposed pull and replace requirement, and given that the liability shift for EMV cards took place in late 2015, the impact regarding the roll-out of EMV-enabled cards will be minimal, if at all.) In addition, the Bureau has included in regulatory text and commentary several detailed provisions and examples involving dates that it believes will be easier for industry to understand if a particular effective date is specified.<footnote ref="522">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; final §§ 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) and 1005.19. See also the specific accommodations surrounding the effective date in final § 1005.18(h)(2) and (3) discussed herein.</footnote>
             Finally, with respect to the Regulation Z portion of this final rule, TILA section 105(d) generally provides that a regulation requiring any disclosure that differs from the disclosures previously required by parts A, D, or E of TILA “shall have an effective date of that October 1 which follows at least six months the date of promulgation.” <footnote ref="523">15 U.S.C. 1604(d). This section also provides, however, that the Bureau may at its discretion lengthen the period of time permitted for creditors or lessors to adjust their forms to accommodate new requirements or shorten the length of time for creditors or lessors to make such adjustments when it makes a specific finding that such action is necessary to comply with the findings of a court or to prevent unfair or deceptive disclosure practices. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau seeks to ensure that consumers receive the benefit of the protections in this final rule as soon as possible and therefore declines to provide financial institutions additional time beyond the 12-month compliance period, except as discussed herein, to comply with specific portions of the rule, as suggested by commenters. With respect to an industry commenter's request to continue overdraft services for six months after the effective date without being subject to the final rule in order to inform consumers of changes to those services, the Bureau believes the overall change to a 12-month effective date should provide sufficient time to provide such notice to consumers. The Bureau does not believe any further modifications or extensions to the effective date are necessary or appropriate. Regarding commenters' concern about the time needed to handle inadvertent overdrafts such as those resulting from force pay transactions, the Bureau has generally excluded such transactions from coverage under Regulation Z.<footnote ref="524">See final Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(4).</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Regarding commenters' request to grandfather in or provide a timeframe to amend or rebid existing vendor contracts, the Bureau does not believe this is necessary and thus declines to do so; however, the Bureau believes the modification to eliminate the proposed pull and replace requirement for preprinted packaging materials will help ameliorate commenters' concerns until new contracts can be executed.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes a 12-month compliance period is sufficient for financial institutions to make system and operational changes to comply with this final rule, especially given the modifications and accommodations discussed herein. Regarding commenters' concern about the time needed to design new disclosures, the Bureau is providing native design files (for print disclosures) and source code (for web-based disclosures) for all of the model and sample disclosures forms included in the final rule to aid in their development.<footnote ref="525">These files are available at &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;www.consumerfinance.gov/prepaid-disclosure-files&lt;/em&gt;.</footnote>
             The Bureau is also committed to working with industry to help address and alleviate burden through regulatory implementation support and guidance.<footnote ref="526">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt;
              &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.consumerfinance.gov/policy-compliance/guidance/implementation-guidance/prepaid&lt;/em&gt;.</footnote>
             With respect to commenters' concern about the time needed to change the process for providing disclosures prior to the acquisition of government benefit accounts, payroll card accounts, and campus cards, the final rule specifically clarifies the timing of acquisition requirements in final comment 18(b)(1)(i)-1 for payroll card accounts and prepaid accounts generally, and in final comments 15(c)-1 and -2 for government benefit accounts. These revisions are consistent with the current practices of many employers and government agencies and therefore should not necessitate significant modifications to current procedures. See the section-by-section analyses of §§ 1005.18(b)(1)(i) and 1005.15(c) for additional information regarding the timing for delivery of pre-acquisition disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Regarding commenters' concern about the time needed to implement changes to comply with the periodic statement alternative in § 1005.18(c)(1) and the summary totals of fees requirement in § 1005.18(c)(5), the Bureau believes the modifications made to those provisions should aid industry in coming into compliance with those requirements. Specifically, the Bureau has modified § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) to require at least 12 months of electronic account transaction history, which commenters stated many financial institutions already make available, and therefore any changes needed to comply with that portion of the rule should be minimal. Likewise, providing at least 24 months of written account transaction history pursuant to final § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii) should have minimal impact on existing business processes because many financial institutions currently archive several years of account information.<footnote ref="527">See the section-by-section analyses of § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) and (iii) above.</footnote>
             Moreover, the Bureau has modified § 1005.18(c)(4), renumbered as § 1005.18(c)(5), to require financial institutions to provide the summary totals of fees only and has removed the proposed requirement to provide summary totals of all deposits to and debits from a consumer's prepaid account. The Bureau also believes the accommodation set forth in § 1005.18(h)(3) for financial institutions that do not have readily available the data necessary to comply fully with the periodic statement alternative or summary totals of fees requirements as of the effective date should provide financial institutions the time needed to comply with the final rule. See the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(c) for additional information regarding the periodic statement alternative and the summary totals of fees requirement.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has also made several revisions to address commenters' concerns regarding the time needed to comply with the requirements to submit prepaid account agreements to the Bureau pursuant to final § 1005.19(b) and to post agreements on the issuer's Web site pursuant to final § 1005.19(c). With respect to the submission requirement, the final rule sets forth a delayed effective date in final § 1005.19(f)(2), which will provide issuers the time needed to develop and implement their own internal processes and procedures for submitting agreements to the Bureau. Regarding the posting requirement, the Bureau believes the modification in final § 1005.19(c) to require issuers to post on their Web sites only agreements that are offered to the general public will reduce the number of agreements at least some issuers must post and therefore should decrease the amount of time needed to comply with this requirement relative to the proposal. In addition, the Bureau believes many issuers already post these agreements to their Web sites. See the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.19 for additional information about the prepaid account agreement submission and posting requirements and the related effective dates.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">18(h)(2)(i).</em> Final § 1005.18(h)(2)(i) establishes an exception for non-compliant disclosures on existing prepaid account access devices and packaging materials. Specifically, it provides that the disclosure requirements of subpart A of Regulation E, as modified by final § 1005.18, shall not apply to any disclosures that are provided, or that would otherwise be required to be provided, on prepaid account access devices, or on, in, or with prepaid account packaging materials that were manufactured, printed, or otherwise produced in the normal course of business prior to October 1, 2017.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is not adopting the proposed requirement that financial institutions and their third-party distribution agents remove from retail store shelves and other distribution channels any prepaid accounts with disclosures not fully in compliance with the final rule as of the effective date. Thus, financial institutions are not required to pull and replace prepaid account access devices and packaging materials that do not contain new disclosures required by this final rule (such as the short form disclosure) or that contain disclosures that are no longer accurate as a result of this final rule (such as a disclosure stating that at least 60 days of electronic and written account transaction history are available under the periodic statement alternative, rather than 12 and 24 months of history, respectively, as required by this final rule). Likewise, financial institutions are not required to retrieve from consumers prepaid account access devices, such as prepaid cards, that were distributed prior to the effective date. The Bureau believes this modification will help to reduce the demand on packaging manufacturers, which commenters stated would have strained resources and caused delays in the production process, and will also mitigate the waste that would have been associated with pulling and replacing packaging with non-compliant disclosures. Financial institutions are not required to provide the pre-acquisition disclosures pursuant to final § 1005.18(b) prior to October 1, 2017.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting new comment 18(h)-1 to explain that the October 1, 2017 effective date applies to disclosures made available or provided to consumers electronically, orally by telephone, or in a form other than on pre-printed materials, such as disclosures printed on paper by a financial institution upon a consumer's request. In addition, the Bureau is adopting new comment 18(h)-2 to provide examples of disclosures that would fall under the exception set forth in § 1005.18(h)(2)(i) and to make clear that disclosures and access devices that are manufactured, printed, or otherwise produced on or after October 1, 2017 must comply with all the requirements of subpart A of Regulation E.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">18(h)(2)(ii).</em> Because the final rule does not require financial institutions to pull and replace packaging materials manufactured, printed, or otherwise produced before October 1, 2017, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to require financial institutions to provide a notice of certain changes and updated initial disclosures to consumers who acquire prepaid accounts on or after October 1, 2017 via such non-compliant packaging materials. Specifically, new § 1005.18(h)(2)(ii)(A) requires that, if a financial institution has changed a prepaid account's terms and conditions as a result of this final rule taking effect such that a change-in-terms notice would have been required under § 1005.8(a) or § 1005.18(f)(2) for existing customers, the financial institution must provide to the consumer a notice of the change within 30 days of obtaining the consumer's contact information. Separately, § 1005.18(h)(2)(ii)(B) requires that the financial institution mail or deliver to the consumer initial disclosures pursuant to § 1005.7 and § 1005.18(f)(1) that have been updated as a result of this final rule taking effect, within 30 days of obtaining the consumer's contact information. The Bureau notes that financial institutions must mail or deliver initial disclosures pursuant to § 1005.18(h)(2)(ii)(B) even if § 1005.18(h)(2)(ii)(A) does not apply.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Because of changes made in the final rule relative to the proposal, the Bureau believes that it is even less likely that financial institutions will make broad changes to their prepaid programs as a result of the final rule taking effect of the kind that would trigger requirements to provide a change-in-terms notice to existing customers under § 1005.8(a) or § 1005.18(f)(2). Those rules require that existing customers be provided with an advance notice in writing only for changes that would result for the consumer in increased fees, increased liability, fewer types of available EFTs, or stricter limitations on the frequency or dollar amount of transfers. For instance, because the final rule requires that Regulation E limited liability and error resolution requirements apply to all accounts, even if they are not registered or verified, the Bureau no longer anticipates that financial institutions would be making changes to their account agreements that would increase liability for consumers. However, based on comments the Bureau received from industry, the Bureau is aware that some financial institutions anticipate discontinuing an available EFT service as it is currently offered as a result of the final rule taking effect, in that the new requirements imposed on overdraft credit features offered in conjunction with prepaid accounts would require certain program restructuring in ways that may affect availability in certain circumstances or for certain consumers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In light of these circumstances, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to impose a requirement (in § 1005.18(h)(2)(ii)(A)) on financial institutions that is parallel to the spirit of Regulation E change-in-terms requirements to notify consumers who acquire a prepaid account after the effective date of the final rule via non-compliant packaging if such changes to the prepaid account's terms and conditions are being made as a result of the rule taking effect. Accordingly, § 1005.18(h)(2)(ii) requires such notice to be provided, via the method specified in § 1005.18(h)(2)(iv), within 30 days of obtaining the consumer's contact information.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>While the Bureau believes that changes to existing programs' terms and conditions as a result of this final rule taking effect that would trigger change-in-terms requirements under Regulation E for existing customers will be rare, the Bureau expects that financial institutions will make other types of changes to their initial disclosures pursuant to §§ 1005.7 and 1005.18(f)(1) in response to this final rule. Accordingly, in light of the decision not to require that outdated packaging be pulled and replaced, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to require (in § 1005.18(h)(2)(ii)(B)) that consumers who acquire a prepaid account with packaging that was printed prior to the effective date receive updated initial disclosures that accurately describe the account's terms, conditions, and related information as required under the final rule.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting § 1005.18(h)(2)(ii) pursuant to its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) and 905(a), and section 1032 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Bureau believes that the notices required pursuant to new § 1005.18(h)(2)(ii) will, consistent with section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, ensure that the features of the prepaid accounts are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the account. In addition, consistent with EFTA sections 904 and 905(a), the Bureau believes the updated initial disclosures will help consumers understand the new terms of their prepaid accounts, as authorized under EFTA section 904(a) and (c) to effectuate the purposes of EFTA.<footnote ref="528">The Bureau notes that this approach is similar to EFTA section 905(c), which provided that for any account of a consumer made accessible prior to EFTA's effective date, the initial disclosures required by EFTA section 905(a) were required to have been disclosed not later than the earlier of (1) the first periodic statement required by EFTA section 906(c) after EFTA's effective date or (2) 30 days after EFTA's effective date.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Because financial institutions generally mail to consumers a personalized prepaid card embossed with the consumer's name, and other informational materials, after the account is registered, the Bureau believes that requiring financial institutions to include a notice of the applicable changes to the prepaid account's terms and conditions and the updated initial disclosures in that mailing will impose very little burden on industry. Further, as discussed under new § 1005.18(h)(2)(iv) below, a financial institution is permitted to deliver the notice and disclosures electronically, without regard to E-Sign consent, if it is not otherwise already mailing or delivering to the consumer written account-related communications within the time periods specified in new § 1005.18(h)(2)(ii). The Bureau believes that the combined effect of new § 1005.18(h)(2)(i) and (ii) will help reduce compliance burden on industry relative to the proposal, while still providing appropriate transparency to consumers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">18(h)(2)(iii).</em> The Bureau is adopting new § 1005.18(h)(2)(iii) to specify and balance burden concerns with respect to providing notices of changes to prepaid accounts' terms and conditions to consumers who acquired prepaid accounts before October 1, 2017. As with § 1005.18(h)(2)(ii) discussed above, the Bureau recognizes that some financial institutions may make changes to prepaid account terms and conditions as a result of this final rule taking effect that would otherwise require a change-in-terms notice under Regulation E, in that the new requirements imposed on overdraft credit features offered in conjunction with prepaid accounts would require certain program restructuring in ways that may affect availability in certain circumstances or to certain consumers. The Bureau believes that financial institutions that offer such features typically require consumers to consent to delivery of electronic disclosures pursuant to the E-Sign Act before any credit is extended, but there may be other consumers with prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program who have never sought to activate that feature on their prepaid accounts and who have not specifically consented to electronic delivery.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In light of these unusual circumstances and other considerations with regard to general implementation of the final rule, the Bureau believes that financial institutions may choose to effectuate such changes in terms as of October 1, 2017, or may want to do so earlier depending on operational convenience. New § 1005.18(h)(2)(iii), which applies to prepaid accounts acquired by consumers before October 1, 2017, is designed to address both scenarios. Specifically, it provides that if a financial institution has changed a prepaid accounts' terms and conditions as a result of this final rule taking effect such that a change-in-terms notice would have been required under § 1005.8(a) or § 1005.18(f)(2) for existing customers, the financial institution must provide to the consumer a notice of the change at least 21 days in advance of the change becoming effective, provided the financial institution has the consumer's contact information. If the financial institution obtains the consumer's contact information less than 30 days in advance of the change becoming effective or after it has become effective, the financial institution is permitted instead to notify the consumer of the change in accordance with the timing requirements set forth in § 1005.18(h)(2)(ii)(A). The financial institution is not required to send a change-in-terms notice for such change pursuant to § 1005.8(a) or § 1005.18(f)(2). As discussed under new § 1005.18(h)(2)(iv) below, a financial institution may provide the notice pursuant to § 1005.18(h)(2)(iii) in electronic form without regard to the consumer notice and consent requirements of section 101(c) of the E-Sign Act in certain circumstances.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes this special notice requirement provides appropriate flexibility to financial institutions in informing consumers with regard to changes to their accounts as a result of the final rule taking effect. The Bureau emphasizes, however, that all changes to a prepaid account's terms and conditions as a result of this final rule taking effect must nevertheless become effective by October 1, 2017. That is, if a financial institution were to provide to a consumer a notice of a change that is subject to § 1005.18(h)(2)(iii) on September 20, the change must nonetheless become effective by October 1; a financial institution is not permitted to delay the effective date of such a change until October 11 (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> 21 days after the financial institution notified the consumer).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting § 1005.18(h)(2)(iii) pursuant to its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c), and section 1032 of the Dodd-Frank Act. EFTA section 905(b) requires financial institutions to notify consumers in writing at least 21 days prior to the effective date of any change in any term or condition of the consumer's account if such change would result in greater cost or liability for such consumer or decreased access to the consumer's account. Because of the unique circumstances involved in effectuating the final rule particularly with regard to consumers who have never sought to activate a credit or overdraft feature in conjunction with a prepaid account and consumers who may be acquiring prepaid accounts close to the date that certain services are discontinued or restricted, the Bureau is exempting financial institutions in this limited circumstance from complying with the change-in-terms notice requirements in § 1005.8(a) and § 1005.18(f)(2). Instead, financial institutions must notify consumers of the change, using the method specified in § 1005.18(h)(2)(iv), 21 days in advance of the change taking effect or, in some circumstances, within 30 days of obtaining the consumer's contact information. Pursuant to EFTA section 904(c), the Bureau believes that exemption from the change-in-terms notice requirement is necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account consumers and to facilitate compliance, by assisting consumers' understanding of the new terms and conditions of their prepaid accounts that are purchased in outdated packaging. In addition, the Bureau believes that the notice to consumers regarding changes to terms and conditions pursuant to § 1005.18(h)(2)(iii) will, consistent with section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, ensure that the features of the prepaid accounts are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Although the Bureau did not propose, nor is it finalizing, a requirement that financial institutions to provide updated initial disclosures to all consumers who opened prepaid accounts prior to the effective date of this final rule, the Bureau notes that it believes it would nonetheless be beneficial for financial institutions to provide updated initial disclosures to existing customers so that they will understand their rights under the new regime and to avoid potential consumer confusion. Accordingly, as discussed in connection with § 1005.18(h)(2)(iv) below, the Bureau has provided a special rule to facilitate delivery of such communications.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">18(h)(2)(iv).</em> The Bureau is adopting new § 1005.18(h)(2)(iv) to facilitate delivery of notices of certain changes and updated initial disclosures for prepaid accounts governed by § 1005.18(h)(2)(ii) or (iii). Specifically, it provides that for these accounts, if a financial institution has not obtained a consumer's consent to provide disclosures in electronic form pursuant to the E-Sign Act, or is not otherwise already mailing or delivering to the consumer written account-related communications within the respective time periods specified in § 1005.18(h)(2)(ii) or (iii), the financial institution may provide to the consumer a notice of a change in terms and conditions pursuant to § 1005.18(h)(2)(ii) or (iii) or required or voluntary updated initial disclosures as a result of this final rule taking effect in electronic form without regard to the consumer notice and consent requirements of section 101(c) of the E-Sign Act.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau has decided, in response to comments, that financial institutions should not be required to pull and replace prepaid account packaging materials with non-compliant disclosures that were produced in the normal course of business prior to October 1, 2017. In addition, the Bureau believes specific provisions are necessary to address how financial institutions should provide notices of certain changes to prepaid account terms and conditions and updated initial disclosures for prepaid accounts that are acquired via outdated packaging. As discussed above, the Bureau believes that most financial institutions will be able to send the notices and disclosures pursuant to § 1005.18(h)(2)(ii) and (iii) at the same time it sends an embossed card following account registration, and therefore there should be little additional burden. For existing customers from whom the financial institution has not already obtained consent to receive disclosures electronically pursuant to the E-Sign Act, or for customers to whom the financial institution is not otherwise mailing or delivering written account-related communications during the relevant time period, the Bureau believes that permitting electronic delivery of notices of changes in terms and conditions pursuant to § 1005.18(h)(2)(ii) or (iii) or required or voluntary updated initial disclosures as a result of this final rule taking effect will minimize compliance burden while still facilitating consumers' understanding of the new terms and conditions of their prepaid accounts in a timely way. Accordingly, new § 1005.18(h)(2)(iv) addresses delivery of voluntary disclosures as well as disclosures that are specifically required under final rule § 1005.18(h)(2)(ii) and (iii) in order to incentivize and facilitate such communications.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting new comments 18(h)-3, -4, and -5 to provide further guidance regarding the provision of consumers with notices pursuant to final § 1005.18(h)(2). Specifically, new comment 18(h)-3 explains that a financial institution that is required to notify consumers of a change in terms and conditions pursuant to § 1005.18(h)(2)(ii) or (iii), or that otherwise provides updated initial disclosures as a result of this final rule taking effect, may provide the notice or disclosures either as a separate document or included in another notice or mailing that the consumer receives regarding the prepaid account to the extent permitted by other laws and regulations. New comment 18(h)-4 explains that a financial institution that has not obtained the consumer's contact information is not required to comply with the requirements set forth in § 1005.18(h)(2)(ii) or (iii). A financial institution is able to contact the consumer when, for example, it has the consumer's mailing address or email address.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting new comment 18(h)-5 to explain the requirements for closed and inactive accounts. Specifically, new comment 18(h)-5 explains that the requirements of § 1005.18(h)(2)(iii) do not apply to prepaid accounts that are closed or inactive, as defined by the financial institution. However, if an inactive account becomes active, the financial institution must comply with the applicable portions of those provisions within 30 days of the account becoming active again in order to avail itself of the timing requirements and accommodations set forth in § 1005.18(h)(2)(iii) and (iv).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">18(h)(3).</em> As discussed above, the Bureau is adopting new § 1005.18(h)(3) and new comment 18(h)-6 to provide an accommodation for financial institutions that do not have sufficient data in a readily accessible form in order to fully comply with the requirements for providing electronic and written account transaction history pursuant to final § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) and (iii) and the summary totals of fees pursuant to final § 1005.18(c)(5) by October 1, 2017. New § 1005.18(h)(3)(i) provides that if, on October 1, 2017, a financial institution does not have readily accessible the data necessary to make available 12 months of electronic account transaction history pursuant to final § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) or to provide 24 months of written account transaction history upon request pursuant to final § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii), the financial institution may make available or provide such histories using the data for the time period it has until the financial institution has accumulated the data necessary to comply in full with the requirements set forth in § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) and (iii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 18(h)-6.i provides the following example to illustrate the provisions of final § 1005.18(h)(3)(i): a financial institution that had been retaining only 60 days of account history before October 1, 2017 would provide 60 days of written account transaction history upon a consumer's request on October 1, 2017. If, on November 1, 2017, the consumer made another request for written account transaction history, the financial institution would be required to provide three months of account history. The financial institution must continue provide as much account history as it has accumulated at the time of a consumer's request until it has accumulated 24 months of account history. Thus, all financial institutions must fully comply with the electronic account transaction history requirement set forth in § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) no later October 1, 2018 and must fully comply with the written account transaction history requirement set forth in § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii) no later October 1, 2019.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Similarly, new § 1005.18(h)(3)(ii) provides that if, on October 1, 2017, the financial institution does not have readily accessible the data necessary to calculate the summary totals of the amount of all fees assessed by the financial institution on the consumer's prepaid account for the prior calendar month and for the calendar year to date pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(5), the financial institution may display the summary totals using the data it has until the financial institution has accumulated the data necessary to display the summary totals as required by § 1005.18(c)(5). New comment 18(h)-6.ii explains that if, on October 1, 2017, the financial institution does not have readily accessible the data necessary to calculate the summary totals of fees for the prior calendar month or the calendar year to date, the financial institution may provide the summary totals using the data it has until the financial institution has accumulated the data necessary to display the summary totals as required by § 1005.18(c)(5). That is, the financial institution would first display the monthly fee total beginning on November 1, 2017 for the month of October, and the year-to-date fee total beginning on October 1, 2017, provided the financial institution discloses that it is displaying the year-to-date total beginning on October 1, 2017 rather than for the entire calendar year 2017. On January 1, 2018, financial institutions must begin displaying year-to-date fee totals for calendar year 2018.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>34(a) Sender Right of Cancellation and Refund</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.34(a) stated that a remittance transfer provider must comply with a sender's oral or written request to cancel a remittance transfer received no later than one business day from when the sender makes payment in connection with the remittance transfer provider. In the proposal, the Board recognized that remittance transfers sent by ACH or wire transfer generally cannot be cancelled once the payment order has been accepted by the sending institution. <em data-original="E-03">See, e.g.,</em> UCC Article 4A-211 (providing that a payment order cannot be cancelled or amended once it has been accepted unless the receiving bank agrees or a funds-transfer system rule allows cancellation or amendment without agreement of the bank). The Board stated that it believed that under such circumstances, a bank or credit union making transfers by ACH or wire transfer would likely wait to execute the payment order until the cancellation period had passed, which could delay the receipt of the funds in the foreign country. The Board stated that one business day would provide a reasonable time frame for a sender to evaluate whether to cancel a remittance transfer after providing payment for the transfer, but requested comment regarding whether the proposed minimum time period should be longer or shorter than proposed.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters objected to the proposed cancellation right. One industry commenter believed a cancellation right was unnecessary for remittance transfers because fees incurred by the sender for a remittance transfer were minimal. A Federal Reserve Bank commenter argued that a cancellation right would give senders less incentive to provide accurate information. One industry commenter believed senders could use the cancellation right to take advantage of more favorable exchange rates. The industry commenter believed remittance transfer providers would increase exchange rates to compensate for the risk of loss.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Industry and trade group commenters agreed with the Board that the proposed cancellation period would delay processing routine remittance transfers because remittance transfers sent by ACH or wire transfer would likely be held until the cancellation period passed. Some industry commenters believed that the delay in processing would make it more difficult to determine an exchange rate. A member of Congress urged the Bureau to take into consideration senders' expectation for timely execution of remittance transfers in determining the appropriate cancellation period. A Federal Reserve Bank commenter believed a sender would want to remit funds as quickly as possible, and that the proposed cancellation right could cause senders to make payments using remittance mechanisms that are not subject to Regulation E.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters believed that the Bureau should require a one business day cancellation period, but suggested that the Bureau study when cancellations typically occur. These commenters suggested that a study could help the Bureau determine that decreasing the cancellation period could adequately protect senders. Many industry commenters believed that if the Bureau required a cancellation period, the period should be shorter than one business day. The commenters suggested a variety of shorter cancellation periods that could be more appropriate. Some industry commenters believed the cancellation period should be shortened to the same day or an hour. Several industry commenters believed the right to cancel should end when the remittance transfer provider executes the payment instruction. Several industry commenters believed the cancellation period should be shortened to 30 minutes, noting that this time period would be consistent with Texas law.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters suggested that institutions sending remittance transfers through ACH or wire transfer should be exempt from the cancellation rules. Other industry commenters suggested that a sender should have the right to opt out of the cancellation right to have the transfer sent immediately. Another industry commenter suggested that the provider should only be required to cancel if the provider has a reasonable opportunity to act upon the request. One industry commenter believed a right to refund remittance transfers that are unclaimed was a more appropriate cancellation policy. An industry commenter believed the provider should not be required to honor cancellation requests that are made for fraudulent purposes.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Other industry commenters believed the cancellation rules should be disclosure-based. One industry commenter believed that instead of a cancellation right, the provider should disclose that once a sender signs the remittance transaction agreement, it cannot be cancelled and that a failure to carry out a sender's cancellation request once a remittance agreement has been signed is not an error. Another industry commenter believed that if a provider had a cancellation policy, that the Bureau should require that it be properly disclosed.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that a cancellation right could be helpful to senders of remittance transfers. The Bureau also believes, however, that providers sending remittance transfers through ACH or wire transfer likely will delay transactions for the length of the cancellation period because such transfers are often difficult to retract once they are sent. A cancellation period of one business day thus could prevent a sender from sending a remittance transfer quickly. In addition, a long cancellation period could create an unfair competitive advantage for closed network money transmitters, who are less likely to delay sending a remittance transfer until the end of the cancellation period. Therefore, the Bureau believes a cancellation period shorter than one business day is appropriate.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The final rule requires a 30-minute cancellation period.<footnote ref="83">The 30-minute cancellation period is the same time period as the remittance transfer cancellation period under Texas law. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; TX Admin. Code § 278.052, which provides that a consumer may cancel a transfer for any reason within 30 minutes of initiating the transfer provided the customer has not left the premises. Unlike the Texas law, under § 1005.34(a), a sender may cancel within 30 minutes, regardless of whether the sender has left the premises.</footnote>
             A 30-minute cancellation period provides the sender the opportunity to review both the pre-payment disclosure and the receipt to ensure that the transfer was sent as the sender intended. However, the 30-minute cancellation period should not substantially delay transactions for senders who want to send funds quickly. The Bureau notes that 30 minutes is the minimum time that a provider must allow senders to cancel transactions, but providers may choose to permit senders to cancel transactions after the 30 minute period has passed. Moreover, even after the cancellation period has passed, senders may still assert their rights under § 1005.33 and obtain a refund or other remedy for transactions where an error occurred.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the final rule sets forth new cancellation requirements in a new § 1005.36 with respect to certain remittance transfers that a sender schedules in advance, including preauthorized remittance transfers. As discussed below, the Bureau believes that when a sender schedules a remittance transfer more than three days in advance of when the remittance transfer is made, a cancellation period tied to when the transfer is made, rather than when the transfer is authorized, is more beneficial to a sender. In those circumstances, the Bureau believes a sender should have the flexibility to cancel the transfer more than 30 minutes after scheduling the transfer to be made, given the potentially significant delay between when the sender authorizes the remittance transfer and when the sender schedules the remittance transfer to be made. Circumstances could change in the intervening period that would negate the purpose of the transfer. At the same time, allowing the sender to cancel certain remittance transfers that a sender schedules in advance for up to 30 minutes after the transfer is made could be burdensome to both senders and providers. A sender may not know the precise time of day that the transfer is scheduled, and such a rule would extend the period of uncertainty for providers, who may delay a transfer until the cancellation period has expired. Consequently, the 30-minute cancellation period described in § 1005.34(a) does not apply to remittance transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, and a remittance transfer provider must instead comply with the cancellation requirements in § 1005.36(c).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.34(a) of the final rule provides that, except as provided in § 1005.36(c), a remittance transfer provider shall comply with the requirements of § 1005.34 with respect to any oral or written request to cancel a remittance transfer from the sender that is received by the provider no later than 30 minutes after the sender makes payment in connection with the remittance transfer, if the following two conditions are met.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>First, under proposed § 205.34(a)(1), a valid request to cancel a remittance transfer must enable the provider to identify the sender's name and address or telephone number and the particular transfer to be cancelled. Proposed comment 34(a)-1 clarified that the request to cancel a remittance transfer is valid so long as the remittance transfer provider is able to identify the remittance transfer in question. For example, the sender could provide the confirmation number or code that would be used by the designated recipient to pick up the transfer, or other identification number or code supplied by the provider in connection with the transfer. The proposed comment also permitted the provider to request, or the sender to provide, the sender's email address instead of a physical address, so long as the provider can identify the transfer to which the cancellation request applies.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Second, proposed § 205.34(a)(2) provided that a sender's timely request to cancel a remittance transfer is effective so long as the transferred funds have not been picked up by the designated recipient or deposited into an account held by the recipient.<footnote ref="84">As discussed in the proposal, such accounts need not be accounts held by a financial institution so long as the recipient may access the transferred funds without any restrictions regarding the use of such funds. For example, some Internet-based providers may track consumer funds in a virtual account or wallet and permit the holder of the account or wallet to make purchases or withdraw funds once funds are credited to the account or wallet.</footnote>
            Proposed comment 34(a)-2 reiterated that a remittance transfer provider must include an abbreviated notice of the sender's right to cancel a remittance transfer in the receipt or combined notice, as applicable. In addition, the proposed comment clarified that the remittance transfer provider must make available to a sender upon request, a notice providing a full description of the right to cancel a remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comment on the two conditions on the right to cancel. The final rule adopts the two conditions as proposed in renumbered § 1005.34(a)(1) and (a)(2). In addition, the Bureau adopts comments 34(a)-1 and 34(a)-2 substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adding comment 34(a)-3 to explain how a remittance transfer provider could comply with the cancellation and refund requirements of § 1005.34 if the cancellation request is received by the provider no later than 30 minutes after the sender makes payment. The comment states that a provider may, at its option, provide a longer time period for cancellation. The comment clarifies that a provider must provide the 30-minute cancellation right regardless of the provider's normal business hours. For example, if an agent closes less than 30 minutes after the sender makes payment, the provider could opt to take cancellation requests through the telephone number disclosed on the receipt. The provider could also set a cutoff time after which the provider will not accept requests to send a remittance transfer. For example, a financial institution that closes at 5:00 p.m. could stop accepting payment for remittance transfers after 4:30 p.m.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter believed that the Bureau should require a sender to contact the remittance transfer provider directly in order to cancel a transaction. The commenter believed that agents should not be required to handle cancellation requests, noting that under certain State laws, the agent does not have a right to the funds paid for a remittance transfer and therefore could not make a refund.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that a sender's cancellation request should be valid if the sender contacts the agent. Many participants in consumer testing indicated that they would contact an agent first if they encountered a problem with their remittance transfer. The Bureau also believes that requiring a sender to contact a remittance transfer provider by, for example, calling the telephone number listed on the receipt could frustrate the sender's ability to cancel within the 30-minute cancellation period. Consequently, the Bureau clarifies in comment 34(a)-4 that a cancellation request provided by a sender to an agent of the remittance transfer provider is deemed to be received by the provider under § 1005.34(a) when received by the agent. The Bureau understands, however, that an agent may not be able to provide a sender with the refund for legal or operational reasons, and, as discussed below, the final rule does not require an agent to provide a refund if the agent is unable to do so.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau is adding a comment to clarify when a sender makes a payment for a remittance transfer, for purposes of determining when the 30-minute cancellation period has passed. Comment 34(a)-5 clarifies that, for purposes of subpart B, payment is made, for example, when a sender provides cash to the remittance transfer provider or when payment is authorized.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>34(b) Time Limits and Refund Requirements</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.34(b) established the time frames and refund requirements applicable to remittance transfer cancellation requests. The proposed rule stated that a remittance transfer provider must refund, at no additional cost to the sender, the total amount of funds tendered by the sender in connection with the remittance transfer, including any fees imposed in connection with the requested transfer, within three business days of receiving the sender's valid cancellation request.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters objected to the requirement in the May 2011 Proposed Rule to refund the total amount of funds to the sender. Industry commenters believed that requiring a refund of the total amount of funds raised significant safety and soundness concerns for institutions sending wire transfers because some remittance transfer providers would be unable to recover the funds from subsequent institutions in a transfer chain. One money transmitter commenter stated that once a transfer is booked at an agent location, the provider is obligated to pay the agent its portion of the transfer fees for the transaction. If a sender cancels the transaction after settlement, the provider would be required to negotiate the return of the fee from the agent or bear the total loss of the fee. Similarly, the commenter noted that it acted as an agent of international billers and is obligated to the billers for the funds when it sends data to the biller. Several industry commenters believed requiring a remittance transfer provider to refund all fees could increase costs for senders, since providers may increase fees to account for losses due to refund. A money transmitter commenter also argued that refunding a third party fee or tax could be impermissible under local law.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters suggested that the Bureau permit a remittance transfer provider to charge reasonable fees, even if the sender cancels the transaction. Some of the commenters noted that this was consistent with a bank's ability to charge fees in connection with a stop payment order on a check to cover the bank's costs. An industry trade association believed providers should be permitted to charge a $45 fee to stop the transaction. Another industry commenter suggested that if the exchange rate changes between the time the order is placed and the refund is requested such that the amount of local currency originally promised would be equivalent to less U.S. dollars, the refund of the principal should be at the new exchange rate.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Some commenters believed a remittance transfer provider should not be required to provide a refund in certain circumstances. One industry commenter believed a provider should not be required to refund fees charged by intermediaries. Another industry commenter suggested that a provider should not have to refund the portion of any fees that are not attributable to costs incurred by them prior to receiving a cancellation request. A trade association believed a provider should not be required to refund fees when the provider has not made any errors.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes it is appropriate to require a provider to refund the total amount of funds provided by the sender in connection with the remittance transfer. The Bureau believes senders could be discouraged from exercising their cancellation rights if they could not recover the cost of the remittance transfer. Although the Bureau recognizes that a provider may not be able to recover some fees or taxes charged for a transfer, the Bureau believes that the shorter cancellation period adopted in the final rule helps address these concerns. Under the final rule, a provider can mitigate some of the risk of losing fees or taxes charged for a transfer by sending a transfer after the 30-minute cancellation period ends. Therefore, the Bureau is requiring the total amount of funds provided by the sender to be refunded in the final rule in § 1005.34(b) with the additional clarification that refunding the total amount of funds provided by the sender in connection with a remittance transfer requires a provider to refund taxes on the remittance transfer. However, as noted by one industry commenter, for certain jurisdictions, the remittance transfer provider may be prohibited by law from refunding taxes. Consequently, the requirement in § 1005.34(b) to refund taxes is only to the extent such refund is not prohibited by law. In the final rule, § 1005.34(b) provides that a remittance transfer provider shall refund, at no additional cost to the sender, the total amount of funds provided by the sender in connection with a remittance transfer, including any fees and, to the extent not prohibited by law, taxes imposed in connection with the remittance transfer, within three business days of receiving a sender's request to cancel the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 34(b)-1 addressed the permissible ways in which a provider could provide a refund. The proposed comment clarified that a remittance transfer provider may, at the provider's discretion, issue a refund in cash or in the same form of payment that was initially tendered by the sender for the remittance transfer. For example, if the sender originally provided a credit card as payment for the transfer, the remittance transfer provider may issue a credit to the sender's credit card account in the amount of the payment.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comment on proposed comment 34(b)-1. However, as discussed above regarding comment 33(c)-6, the Bureau is amending comment 34(b)-1 with respect to refunds if a sender initially provided cash for the remittance transfer. Specifically, comment 34(b)-1 states that a provider may issue a refund by check if a sender initially provided cash for the remittance transfer. For example, if the sender originally provided cash as payment for the transfer, the provider may mail a check to the sender in the amount of the payment.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also finalizing comment 34(b)-2, which addresses costs that must be refunded upon a sender's timely request to cancel a remittance transfer. The comment is adopted substantially as proposed, with amendments clarifying that all funds provided by the sender in connection with the remittance transfer would include taxes that are assessed by a State or other governmental body, to the extent not prohibited by law. Therefore, the final comment states that if a sender provides a timely request to cancel a remittance transfer, a remittance transfer provider must refund all funds provided by the sender in connection with the remittance transfer, including any fees and, to the extent not prohibited by law, taxes that have been imposed for the transfer, whether the fee or tax was assessed by the provider or a third party, such as an intermediary institution, the agent or bank in the recipient country, or a State or other governmental body.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, industry commenters suggested amendments to the requirement in the proposal to provide a refund within three business days of receiving a sender's request to cancel the remittance transfer. One industry commenter believed the refund rule should not require the refund to be delivered to the sender within three business days. The commenter cited examples of when it could be difficult to deliver the funds to the sender in three days, such as when the provider mails a refund check and the check takes several days to be delivered to the sender; when the refund is available at an agent location, but the sender takes several days to pick-up the refund; and when the provider issues a chargeback to the sender's credit or debit card account, but the credit takes several days to appear due to card processing systems. The Bureau notes that the requirement to refund funds to a sender does not require a provider to ensure that a refund is delivered to a sender within three business days after receiving the sender's request to cancel the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, Regulation E currently contains provisions in § 1005.15 that are specifically applicable to an account established by a government agency for distributing government benefits to a consumer electronically. Existing § 1005.15(a)(2) defines a government benefit “account” to exclude accounts for distributing needs-tested benefits in a program established under State or local law or administered by a State or local agency. The Bureau proposed to have § 1005.2(b)(3)(iii) state that the term prepaid account included a government benefit account, as defined in existing § 1005.15(a)(2), but did not repeat the exclusion in § 1005.15(a)(2) for State and local needs-tested benefit programs as part of the definition of prepaid account in proposed § 1005.2(b)(3). To make clear that accounts excluded from the definition of government benefit account in § 1005.15(a)(2) are also excluded from the general definition of prepaid account in § 1005.2(b)(3), and pursuant to its authority under EFTA section 904(d) to further the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account consumers, the Bureau is finalizing new § 1005.2(b)(3)(ii)(E) to explicitly exclude accounts established for distributing needs-tested benefits in a program established under State or local law or administered by a State or local agency, as set forth in § 1005.15(a)(2).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Virtual Currency</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As noted in part II.D above, the Bureau received a number of comments on whether the Bureau should regulate virtual currency products and services under this final rule. Commenters included banks, a digital wallet provider, a virtual currency exchange, industry trade associations, consumer advocacy groups, a law firm representing a coalition of prepaid issuers, and a non-governmental virtual currency policy organization.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters had mixed reactions to whether the Bureau should regulate virtual currency products and services. Two trade association commenters representing banks stated that the proposed definition of “prepaid account” should be modified to expressly include accounts funded or capable of being funded with virtual currencies and submitted a definition of virtual currency they urged the Bureau to adopt. They asserted that virtual currencies are “funds” under EFTA, and coverage is needed to ensure consumers get the kind of protections they would have if they used other comparable but closely regulated traditional payment systems and products. They further asserted that virtual currency products and systems pose greater risks to consumers than traditional payment products and systems funded with fiat currency.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>These trade association commenters further asserted their belief that, with few exceptions, regulating prepaid accounts funded in virtual currencies would be consistent with the Bureau's goal of providing comprehensive consumer protections for prepaid products. With respect to the exceptions, the commenters suggested that it was unnecessary to regulate virtual currencies that can only be used (1) at a specific merchant or defined group of affiliated merchants; (2) within online gaming platforms with no market or application outside of those platforms; or (3) as part of a customer affinity or rewards program. They asserted that their suggested carve outs are similar to the proposed exclusions for certain store gift cards and for loyalty, award, or promotional gift cards, in the proposed definition of prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>On the other hand, a diverse group of industry commenters and a non-governmental virtual currency policy organization commenter urged the Bureau to expressly provide in the final rule that it does not apply to virtual currency products and services. Commenters expressed concern that regulation would be premature, thus potentially stifling innovation. Several commenters highlighted the low rate of consumer adoption of virtual currency products and services. Commenters also asserted that the Bureau has not adequately studied the virtual currency industry, and that regulations developed for GPR cards are unsuitable to apply to virtual currency products and services because of the differences between such products and services and GPR cards.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A law firm commenting on behalf of a coalition of prepaid issuers and a virtual currency trade association commented that they supported the Bureau's desire to ensure consumer protection rules are applied consistently across different industries that share similar functionalities. However, neither commenter supported regulating virtual currency products and services in the context of the prepaid rulemaking. The law firm commenter asserted that it was premature to regulate virtual currency products and services, and that adopting regulations to apply to virtual currency products and services would impose significant regulatory burden on such products and services and also stifle innovation. It further suggested that the Bureau adopt the approach the Board took with respect to the regulation of prepaid cards generally. It asserted that despite the Board's decision to not extend the coverage of its Payroll Card Rule to GPR cards, issuers of GPR cards have nonetheless applied consumer protection comparable to those established in that rule. The trade association commenter asserted that the Bureau should address virtual currencies in a separate rulemaking.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters generally urged the Bureau to regulate those virtual currency products and services that are used by or marketed to consumers. Specifically, two consumer group commenters stated that the Bureau was right to develop rules that, they believed, anticipated the increasing role of virtual currencies. One urged the Bureau to extend the definition of account to include virtual currency wallets, stating that such extension would be appropriate because it is important for consumer protection rules to be in place before consumer adoption of such wallets becomes widespread, and the application of Regulation E to virtual currency wallets could incent virtual currency wallet providers to ensure that the funds consumers put into virtual currency wallets are adequately protected (to the extent they are not already doing so). Another consumer group commenter asserted that as long as virtual currencies are used for consumer purposes, consumers need protection. It observed that current virtual currency systems lack such protections and highlighted the lack of protection in the areas of limited liability, dispute rights, and error resolution. However, one consumer group commenter opposed regulating virtual currency products and services as prepaid accounts. The commenter stated that it did not believe that accounts that convert fiat money into stored value in a form that is not fiat currency should be classified as prepaid accounts, because the funds in those accounts would be protected once they are converted back into fiat currency.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau stated in the proposal that the Bureau's analysis is ongoing with respect to virtual currencies and related products and services. The proposed rule did not resolve specific issues with respect to the application of either existing regulations or the proposed rule to virtual currencies and related products and services. Accordingly, although the Bureau received some comments addressing virtual currency products and services, the Bureau reiterates that application of Regulation E and this final rule to such products and services is outside of the scope of this rulemaking. However, the Bureau notes that as part of its broader administration and enforcement of the enumerated consumer financial protection statutes and title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Bureau continues to analyze the nature of products or services tied to virtual currencies.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Regulation E's gift card provisions cover some prepaid products that also could fall within the proposed definition of prepaid account. In particular, § 1005.20 contains provisions applicable to gift certificates, store gift cards, and general-use prepaid cards.<footnote ref="310">The Gift Card Rule defines a general-use prepaid card as “a card, code, or other device that is: (i) Issued on a prepaid basis primarily for personal, family, or household purposes to a consumer in a specified amount, whether or not that amount may be increased or reloaded, in exchange for payment; and (ii) Redeemable upon presentation at multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, or usable at automated teller machines.” § 1005.20(a)(3).</footnote>
             For those products marketed and sold as gift cards (and that meet certain other qualifications), the Gift Card Rule requires certain disclosures, limits the imposition of certain fees, and contains other restrictions. The Gift Card Rule is distinct from the rest of subpart A of Regulation E, however, and does not provide consumers who use gift cards with the other substantive protections of Regulation E, such as limited liability and error resolution protections, or periodic statements. The Gift Card Rule in § 1005.20(b)(2) expressly excludes those general-use prepaid cards that are reloadable and not marketed or labeled as gift cards or gift certificates, while including general-use prepaid cards that are not reloadable as well as those that are marketed or labeled as gift cards or gift certificates. The Bureau proposed to add § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(C), which would have provided that a prepaid account was not a gift certificate as defined in § 1005.20(a)(1) and (b); a store gift card as defined in § 1005.20(a)(2) and (b); a loyalty, award, or promotional gift card as defined in § 1005.20(a)(4) and (b); or a general-use prepaid card as defined in § 1005.20(a)(3) and (b) that is both marketed and labeled as a gift card or gift certificate.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believed that having to apply both the existing gift card regulatory requirements and the proposed prepaid account requirements could adversely impact the gift card market. The Bureau further expressed concern that if the requirements of the proposed rule were applied to gift cards, it was possible that those requirements, in the context of the typical gift card, could confuse consumers. Relatedly, the Bureau noted that, because most gift cards are not reloadable, not usable at ATMs, and not open loop, consumers were less likely to use gift cards as transaction account substitutes. Finally, the Bureau was concerned that, were it to impose provisions for access to account information and error resolution, and create limits on consumers' liability for unauthorized EFTs, the cost structure of gift cards could change dramatically, since, unlike other types of prepaid products, many gift cards do not typically offer these protections. The Bureau noted in the proposal that the exemption in the Gift Card Rule for general-use prepaid cards applies to products that are reloadable and not marketed <em data-original="E-03">or</em> labeled as gift cards or gift certificates.<footnote ref="311">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; § 1005.20(b)(2).</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>By contrast, the Bureau proposed to exclude from the definition of prepaid account only such general-use prepaid products that were <em data-original="E-03">both</em> marketed and labeled as gift cards or gift certificates. The Bureau was concerned that, absent this approach, some products it intended to cover in the proposal may be inadvertently excluded due to occasional or incidental marketing activities. For example, comment 20(b)(2)-2 describes, in part, a network-branded GPR card that is principally advertised as a less-costly alternative to a bank account but is promoted in a television, radio, newspaper, or internet advertisement, or on signage as “the perfect gift” during the holiday season. For purposes of the Gift Card Rule, such a product would be considered marketed as a gift card or gift certificate because of this occasional holiday marketing activity. For purposes of proposed § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(C), however, such a product would not have been considered to be both marketed and labeled as a gift card or gift certificate and thus would have been covered by the proposed definition of prepaid account. Proposed comment 2(b)(3)(i)-9 would have explained this distinction.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>A number of issuing banks, a digital wallet provider, and an industry trade association submitted comments in support of the proposed exclusion for gift cards. Two trade association commenters urged the Bureau to expand the exclusion to also cover rebate or refund cards used by retailers or other businesses as part of their merchandise return or reimbursement programs. In addition, a program manager and a payment network objected to the Bureau's decision to exclude only those GPR products that were both marketed and labeled as gift cards. These commenters urged the Bureau to exclude any prepaid product that was subject to the Gift Card Rule, regardless of how it was marketed or labeled. They argued that any card subject to the Gift Card Rule was likely to be limited in function and therefore did not warrant coverage by a rule aimed at protecting transaction account substitutes. In the same vein, they argued that the burden of complying with the proposal would far outweigh the benefit to consumers for these products, and could effectively remove these products from the marketplace. In addition, the payment network noted that the fact that some prepaid products could be subject to both the proposal and the Gift Card Rule could confuse consumers and create regulatory ambiguity for industry.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Two consumer group commenters, by contrast, opposed this proposed exclusion. One group urged the Bureau to cover network-branded, open-loop reloadable gift cards loaded with at least $500, while the other urged the Bureau to cover reloadable gift cards with a balance of at least $250, each arguing that a card that is loaded with more than those amounts poses a higher consumer risk associated with unauthorized transactions.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is finalizing proposed § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(C) and proposed comment 2(b)(3)(i)-9, renumbered as § 1005.2(b)(3)(ii)(D) and comment 2(b)(3)(ii)-3, respectively, with technical revisions to conform internal references to reordering elsewhere in the final rule. Gift certificates and gift cards do not meet the Bureau's definition of prepaid accounts, as they typically cannot be used with multiple, unaffiliated merchants. With regard to general-use prepaid cards that are both marketed and labeled as a gift card or gift certificate, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to finalize this exclusion pursuant to its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to further the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account consumers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>After consideration of the comments, the Bureau remains convinced that subjecting this general category of products to both the Gift Card Rule and the requirements of this final rule would place a significant burden on industry without a corresponding consumer benefit. On the other hand, the Bureau continues to believe that the gift card exclusion should not extend to products that consumers may use as or confuse with transaction account substitutes, even if such products are also covered by the Gift Card Rule. To illustrate, the Bureau understands that some consumers may use multiple non-reloadable cards as transaction accounts to pay important household expenses like utilities and groceries, spending them down and discarding them when the funds are depleted. These cards may be subject to the Gift Card Rule because they are not reloadable and thus do not qualify for the GPR card exclusion in § 1005.20(b)(2). However, if these cards are not labeled or marketed as gift cards, it is possible that consumers will unwittingly acquire these cards thinking that they carry the same protections as other prepaid accounts under this final rule. As previously stated, the Bureau believes consumers who use non-reloadable prepaid products in this way deserve the same protections as consumers who use GPR cards. Further, the Bureau believes that consumers generally understand the protections associated with, and limitations of, gift cards to the extent they are labeled as such. Accordingly, the Bureau declines to expand the proposed exclusion for accounts that are <em data-original="E-03">both</em> marketed and labeled as gift cards to accounts that are labeled <em data-original="E-03">or</em> marketed as gift cards, as some industry commenters suggested. The Bureau notes that in the gift card provisions of the Credit CARD Act, Congress expressly granted to the Board (now to the Bureau) authority to determine the extent to which the individual definitions and provisions of EFTA or Regulation E should apply to general-use prepaid cards, gift certificates, and store gift cards.<footnote ref="312">Public Law 111-24, 123 Stat. 1734, 1754 (2009); EFTA section 915(d)(1)(B); 15 U.S.C. 1693l-1(d)(1)(B).</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has considered the comments asserting that coverage under both the Prepaid and Gift Card Rules will cause consumer confusion and regulatory ambiguity. However, the Bureau understands that, currently, prepaid issuers consciously avoid marketing and labeling their products in such a way as would cause such products to be covered under the Gift Card Rule. As such, the Bureau believes that, in practice, very few products that are subject to the Gift Card Rule will also qualify as prepaid accounts under this final rule.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau declines to expressly expand the exclusion for accounts that are both marketed and labeled as gift cards to rebate cards, as two commenters suggested. The Bureau believes such an express exclusion would be unnecessary, since such programs are generally excluded from the rule under the exclusion for loyalty, award, or promotional gift cards, as defined in § 1005.20(a)(4) and (b). Existing comment 20(a)(4)-1.iii lists rebate programs operated or administered by a merchant or product manufacturer that can be redeemed for goods or services.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(a) Coverage</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to modify § 1005.18(a) to state that a financial institution shall comply with all applicable requirements of EFTA and Regulation E with respect to prepaid accounts except as modified by proposed § 1005.18. Proposed § 1005.18(a) would have also referred to proposed § 1005.15 for rules governing government benefit accounts.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Existing comment 18(a)-1 addresses issuance of access devices under § 1005.5 and explains that a consumer is deemed to request an access device for a payroll card account when the consumer chooses to receive salary or other compensation through a payroll card account. The Bureau proposed to add a cross-reference to § 1005.5(b) (regarding unsolicited issuance of access devices) in comment 18(a)-1 and to add additional guidance that would have explained that a consumer was deemed to request an access device for a prepaid account when, for example, the consumer acquired a prepaid account offered for sale at a retail store or acquired a prepaid account by making a request or submitting an application by telephone or online. The Bureau also proposed to revise existing comment 18(a)-2 regarding application of Regulation E to employers and services providers to refer to prepaid accounts in addition to payroll card accounts, but otherwise the proposal would have left current comment 18(a)-2 unchanged.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One program manager commenter asked the Bureau to clarify in existing comment 18(a)-1 that the distribution of an un-activated payroll card to a new employee did not constitute unsolicited issuance of a payroll card account. A number of other industry commenters, including a trade association and two issuing banks, requested that the Bureau make the same clarification with respect to other account types, including disaster relief cards and student ID cards that also function as prepaid accounts. With respect to the first comment, the Bureau did not intend the proposal to alter the application of § 1005.5 to payroll card accounts, nor is this final rule making such a change. As such, the Bureau declines to revise comment 18(a)-1 in the final rule to change the existing guidance with respect to when a consumer solicits a payroll card account.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>With respect to the request for similar clarification regarding other types of cards, the Bureau does not believe that such a clarification is warranted.<footnote ref="356">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; § 1005.5(b)(1), (3), and (4). As discussed in part II.B above, ED recently finalized a rule “intended to ensure that students have convenient access to their title IV, HEA program funds,&lt;SU&gt;[]&lt;/SU&gt; do not incur unreasonable and uncommon financial account fees on their title IV funds, and are not led to believe they must open a particular financial account to receive their Federal student aid.” 80 FR 67126 (Oct. 30, 2015). ED considered, but did not adopt, limitations on schools or financial institutions sending students ID cards that can act as access devices to a student's account. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt; at 67159. In stating its decision, however, ED noted that distribution of such ID cards would constitute an unsolicited issuance under § 1005.5(b); accordingly, financial institutions must still comply with consumer protection rules regarding unsolicited access device issuance. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
             The Bureau understands from the comments received that most issuers of student prepaid accounts already comply with most, if not all, of the requirements of existing § 1005.5(b) with respect to such cards. Specifically, the Bureau understands that, when students receive access devices they did not specifically request, the devices are inactive and need to be validated before they can be used to access a prepaid account; further, the Bureau understands the devices already come accompanied by most, if not all, of the disclosures required by § 1005.7. The Bureau believes that the remaining requirements of § 1005.5(b)—that the access devices be accompanied by an explanation that it is not validated, as well as an explanation of how the consumer may dispose of the card—should not place an additional ongoing burden on issuers of student prepaid accounts.<footnote ref="357">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; § 1005.5(b)(2).</footnote>
             At the same time, the Bureau is aware of reports of students incurring “confusing” or “unreasonably high fees” for using their student cards.<footnote ref="358">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 80 FR 67126, 67128 (Oct. 30, 2015).</footnote>
             The Bureau believes that, consistent with § 1005.5(b), students who receive ID cards with a prepaid functionality they did not request should know that they are receiving a financial product, and should be aware that they have the right to decline that product's functionality if they so wish.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In sum, the Bureau believes there are significant consumer protection benefits in requiring student ID cards with prepaid functionality to comply with the unsolicited issuance provisions in § 1005.5(b), even in light of any the potential burden to industry. The Bureau therefore declines to add an exception to the unsolicited issuance provisions in § 1005.5(b) for student ID cards, and, likewise, is not adopting any additional guidance with respect to when a student ID card is distributed on an unsolicited basis in § 1005.18. Accordingly, student ID cards with prepaid functionality that are distributed without a consumer's request, and not as a renewal or substitution for an existing access device, are unsolicited and must comply with the requirements of § 1005.5(b).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive any additional comments on its proposed revisions to § 1005.18(a). Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting § 1005.18(a) and related commentary as proposed, with certain technical revisions to comment 18(a)-1 for clarity and consistency with the Bureau's changes to § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii), discussed below.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>2(b)(3)(ii)(A)</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.2(b)(3)(iv) would have addressed prepaid products established in connection with certain health care and employee benefit programs. Specifically, the proposed provision would have stated that the term prepaid account did not include a health savings account, flexible spending account, medical savings account, or a health reimbursement arrangement. Proposed comment 2(b)(3)(iv)-1 would have defined these terms by referencing existing provisions in the Internal Revenue Code. Specifically, the Bureau proposed to define “health savings account” as a health savings account as defined in 26 U.S.C. 223(d); “flexible spending account” as a cafeteria plan which provides health benefits or a health flexible spending arrangement pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 125; “medical savings account” as an Archer MSA as defined in 26 U.S.C. 220(d); and “health reimbursement arrangement” as a health reimbursement arrangement which is treated as employer-provided coverage under an accident or health plan for purposes of 26 U.S.C. 106.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believed that, while these health care and employee benefit accounts could, in some ways, be similar to other types of prepaid accounts, coverage under Regulation E was not necessary at this time. Specifically, the Bureau noted that these products typically come with limits on the amount of funds that could be loaded on to them, the methods for loading, and numerous restrictions on where, when, and how those funds could be spent.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received several comments in response to this aspect of the proposal. Several consumer groups opposed the exclusion, noting that the accounts at issue can hold large amounts of money that consumers use over long periods of time. These commenters noted further that these types of accounts especially warrant error resolution protections since—according to the commenters—healthcare billing is notoriously error-prone. In addition, these commenters asserted that compliance should not be overly burdensome for issuers of these types of accounts, since many of the underlying benefit programs already provide consumers with error resolution protections.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>By contrast, industry commenters, including issuing banks and credit unions, trade associations representing both financial institutions and employers, a payment network, and a program manager, expressed support for the proposed exclusions, and urged the Bureau to expand them further to include additional categories of similar employer-sponsored compensation programs. Specifically, several commenters urged the Bureau to add exclusions for accounts used to disburse parking, transit, dependent care, and wellness benefits. They argued that these programs are similar in several key respects to the types of programs the Bureau excluded from the definition of prepaid account in the proposal. For example, they explained that these accounts are typically funded from the employer's general assets, not by consumers, and as such they belong to the employer rather than the consumer. They argued further that these accounts do not warrant coverage under the rule because they are not consumer asset accounts in the sense that their use is highly restricted and, for certain types of programs, the funds held in them are notional, rather than actual, in nature. A subset of these commenters also urged the Bureau to reconsider referring to specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code when specifying the types of programs that would qualify for the exclusion, noting that the Code's numbering may change in the future.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is finalizing exclusions for health savings accounts, flexible spending arrangements, medical savings accounts, and health reimbursement arrangements in proposed § 1005.2(b)(3)(iv), renumbered as § 1005.2(b)(3)(ii)(A). The Bureau is likewise finalizing proposed comment 2(b)(3)(iv)-1, renumbered as 2(b)(3)(ii)-1. The Bureau is persuaded that accounts used to disburse funds related to these programs are fundamentally different from other prepaid accounts covered by the final rule. As stated in the proposal, these products are governed by the terms of their plans and related regulations, such that, for example, health savings accounts and medical savings accounts can typically only be used to pay for qualified medical expenses. The Bureau believes that the limited use of funds under such arrangements distinguish them from consumer transaction accounts. As such, the Bureau believes such accounts are appropriately excluded from the rule. The Bureau believes that the term account is reasonably interpreted not to include these types of products or, in the alternative, to further the purposes of EFTA; the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to finalize an express exclusion in final § 1005.2(b)(3)(ii)(A).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has also considered the comments requesting that additional categories of employer-sponsored compensation be added to the exclusion in § 1005.2(b)(3)(ii)(A). The Bureau agrees that, to the extent other programs exist that are significantly similar to health savings accounts, flexible spending arrangements, medical savings accounts, and health reimbursement arrangements, those programs should also be excluded from the rule for the same reasons. Accordingly, the Bureau is expanding the exclusion to encompass accounts associated with other employer-sponsored benefit arrangements, namely, accounts used to disburse funds from a dependent care assistance program or a transit or parking reimbursement arrangement. The Bureau is adding a reference to these additional program types in final § 1005.2(b)(3)(ii)(A) and the Internal Revenue Code sections that reference them in final comment 2(b)(3)(ii)-1. The Bureau is finalizing that comment with references to the relevant Internal Revenue Code sections because it believes that specificity will help ensure that the exclusions remain limited in scope, and because it believes that the clarity provided by such specificity outweighs the potential difficulty that may occur in the event the numbering scheme of the Internal Revenue Code changes.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is otherwise finalizing § 1005.2(b)(3)(ii)(A) and comment 2(b)(3)(ii)-1 as proposed. The Bureau notes, in response to commenters that requested that it add an exclusion for employee wellness programs, that such programs are likely excluded from the rule under the exclusion for loyalty, award, or promotional gift cards. That exclusion applies to loyalty, award, or promotional gift cards, as defined in § 1005.20(a)(4) and (b). Existing comment 20(a)(4)-1.vi lists incentive programs through which an employer provides cards to employees to encourage employee wellness as a type of loyalty, award, or promotional gift card.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(b)(7)(ii) Prominence and Size</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii)(A) through (D) would have set forth the prominence and size requirements for the short form and long form disclosures. Generally, the Bureau believed that the information provided to consumers in the short form and long form disclosure should appear in a large enough font size to ensure that consumers can easily read the information. Further, the Bureau observed in its pre-proposal consumer testing that some participants had to use reading glasses or otherwise struggled to read existing prepaid account disclosures and that many participants reported a preference for larger font sizes to facilitate their ability both to read and to understand disclosures. Thus, the Bureau proposed minimum font size requirements for both the short form and long form disclosures in order to ensure that consumers can easily read the disclosures. In addition, the Bureau believed that the proposed relative font sizes for the disclosures made on the short form would ensure that consumers' attention is quickly drawn to the most important information about a prepaid account (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the top-line fees).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also noted in the proposal that the proposed minimum font sizes were likely also the maximum sizes that could be used on the short form disclosure to ensure that it will still fit on most packaging material currently used in retail settings. In other acquisition scenarios, when space constraints are not as much of an issue, the Bureau expected that financial institutions would use larger versions of the short form disclosure. For example, when distributing disclosures for payroll card accounts in printed form, financial institutions could use a 8.5x11 inch piece of paper to present a larger version of the short form disclosure, as long as the form maintains the visual hierarchy of the information as reflected in the proposed relative font size requirements. Proposed § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">2</em>), discussed in more detail below, would have required that the statement disclosed pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">10</em>), and the telephone number and Web site URL disclosed pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">11</em>) must be more prominent than the information disclosed pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">12</em>) through (<em data-original="E-03">14</em>) and proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(C). The Bureau believed that it is particularly important for a consumer to see this information on the short form disclosure, and that making it more prominent than the other textual language on the short form could help to draw consumers' attention to these disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received few comments regarding the proposed prominence and size requirements. A digital wallet provider commented that the prescriptive font size and other format and formatting requirements of the proposed rule would remove the flexibility to shrink or resize disclosures to fit onto mobile screens, resulting in a confusing and frustrating user experience as it would be impossible to view the entire disclosure at once without zooming out to a wider view.<footnote ref="461">See the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(6)(i)(B) above for the Bureau's response to this commenter's concern and other issues relating to electronic disclosures.</footnote>
             A trade association recommended that the Bureau preempt State laws regarding font size where compliance with both the proposed font size and State law would be impracticable, specifically citing a Maryland law requiring a minimum 12-point font for its required payroll card account disclosures that the commenter indicated would make it difficult to fit the short form on one page. A consumer group commenter recommended that the Bureau require larger font size for disclosures provided in non-retail settings. It said that while small print may be unavoidable in retail stores, font size was not similarly constrained in other locations such as Web sites, bank branches, and in settings in which payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts are offered.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii)(A) through (D), renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(7)(ii)(A) through (D), generally as proposed with additional specificity for certain requirements and other modifications as discussed below. The Bureau is also adopting new comments 18(b)(7)(ii)-1 and -2 to provide additional clarification regarding type size requirements in final § 1005.18(b)(7)(ii). See the section-by-section analyses of § 1005.18(b)(7)(ii)(A), (B), (C), and (D) below for prominence and size requirements with respect to typeface and type color generally as well as specific requirements regarding the general short form disclosure, the long form disclosure, and the multiple service plan short form disclosure, respectively.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is finalizing the proposed visual hierarchy of information for the short form disclosure created by requiring minimum type sizes in descending order because, as explained in the proposal, this format quickly garners consumers' attention, directing it first to the information the Bureau's research indicates is most important to consumers when selecting a prepaid account. The final rule also retains the actual type size requirements as proposed, with the addition of size requirements for newly-created permissible or required disclosures or those that were unspecified in the proposed rule. The Bureau continues to believe that the size requirements will ensure that consumers can read and understand the disclosures without struggling to see small print while also accommodating the existing packaging constraints for prepaid accounts sold at retail locations. Also, in the final rule, the Bureau has replaced “font” size with “type” size for clarity, as the term font can refer to both type size and type style. Finally, instead of stating that disclosures must be made in the “corresponding pixel size” for electronic disclosures when providing the minimum type size for each element of the disclosures, the final rule includes the actual corresponding pixel size for each type size specified.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau declines to mandate type size requirements that vary depending on the setting in which consumers receive the pre-acquisition disclosures. As discussed above, the Bureau designed the minimum type sizes requirements for the short form disclosure, that appear in final § 1005.18(b)(7)(ii)(B) and (D), to accommodate the existing packaging constraints related to the sale of prepaid accounts on J-hooks displays in retail locations. Financial institutions are encouraged, but not required, to use larger type sizes when providing pre-acquisition disclosures for prepaid accounts in less space-restrictive settings. For example, financial institutions offering prepaid accounts online, in a bank branch, in the context of payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts, and in other similar circumstances are encouraged to provide the short form disclosure in a type size that exceeds the minimum requirements in the rule to enhance both consumer engagement and comprehension of the prepaid account's terms.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>To illustrate this, both the proposed and final model forms for government benefit accounts and payroll card accounts use type sizes that exceed the regulatory minimum. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> Model Forms A-10(a) and (b). Even when disclosing other information on the same page as the short form disclosure, such as when exercising the option to display State-required information or other fees and discounts on the same page as (but outside) the short form disclosure for these products pursuant to final §§ 1005.15(c)(2)(ii) and 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B), the Bureau believes the required disclosures can exceed the minimum size requirements set forth in the final rule. To that end, new comment 18(b)(7)(ii)-1 explains that a financial institution may provide disclosures in a type size larger than the required minimum to enhance consumer comprehension in any acquisition scenario, as long as the financial institution complies with the type/pixel size hierarchy set forth in final § 1005.18(b)(7)(ii). New comment 18(b)(7)(ii)-2 clarifies that references in final § 1005.18(b)(7)(ii) to “point” size correspond to printed disclosures and references to “pixel” size correspond to disclosures provided via electronic means.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau declines to follow the recommendation of an industry commenter that the Bureau preempt certain State law font size requirements that it believes would be impracticable to reconcile with the Bureau's font size requirements. Section 1005.12(b) addresses standards for when inconsistent State law is preempted, but the Bureau does not read the comment to argue that the Bureau's font size requirements are inconsistent with any State law requirements. Moreover, the Bureau notes that financial institutions can provide short form disclosures for payroll accounts in a larger font and on 8.5″ x 11″ or larger paper, as they are not subject to the same space constraints, for example, as are many retail locations.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, as explained in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(7)(iii) below generally regarding State-required information not permitted within the short form disclosure, financial institutions are free to disclose State-required information outside the confines of the short form disclosure, even on the same page as the short form disclosure. In fact, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B), the final rule permits inclusion in the short form disclosure of a statement directing the consumer to a particular location outside the short form disclosure for certain information (ways the consumer may access payroll card account funds and balance information for free or for a reduced fee). Financial institutions have the option of providing other State-required information, including information complying with State conspicuousness requirements, in the location referenced in the short form disclosure pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B) or in any other location the financial institution sees fit outside the short form disclosure. Because financial institutions have these options outside the short form disclosure to disclose information required by or otherwise comply with the laws of specific States, the Bureau does not believe either further modification to this final rule nor preemption of State law regarding prominence and size is necessary or appropriate.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received a request through the interagency consultation process to expressly exempt from the prepaid account definition certain accounts, currently marketed under the brand names Eagle Cash and Navy Cash/Marine Cash, that are primarily used by members of the armed forces to conduct closed-loop transactions on military property. According to the request, these accounts allow servicemembers to conduct closed-loop transactions in forward-deployed environments, such as an army base or a naval vessel, where cash is inconvenient and other commercially available payments technologies are unavailable. These accounts sometimes offer a P2P feature that allows users to transfer loaded funds to other accountholders from the closed-loop “purse” of the account, but such functionality, the Bureau understands, is incidental to the primary closed-loop function of the account.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees that accounts whose primary function is to facilitate closed-loop transactions by members of the armed forces in forward-deployed environments are sufficiently distinguishable and unique to warrant a narrow, express exclusion from the final rule. Accordingly, to further the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account consumers, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to finalize an express exclusion in new § 1005.2(b)(3)(ii)(C) for the P2P transfer functionality of an account established or through the United States government whose primary function is to conduct closed-loop transactions on U.S. military installations or vessels, or similar government facilities. This express exclusion will protect servicemember consumers by ensuring that they have access to a convenient and well-established payment method at a time when alternate payment methods such as cash or bank accounts may not be available for operational reasons. The Bureau notes that this is a narrow exclusion intended to accommodate a specific set of closed-loop products that are used in unique circumstances, such as on military vessels or bases, or similar government facilities (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> embassies or consulates) in remote locations. The Bureau notes further that, to the extent that such accounts offer an open-loop capability that allows the consumer to conduct transactions at multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, that functionality would not be covered by this exclusion.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>Several commenters, including a payment network, an issuing bank, several industry trade associations, and a national relief organization, urged the Bureau to add a separate exclusion for accounts used to distribute disaster relief funds. Most notably, the national relief organization noted that the accounts used to distribute the funds, as well as the funds themselves, are the property of the relief organization, not the consumer, which makes these accounts distinct from other consumer asset accounts the Bureau proposed to cover. Commenters argued that such accounts are different because consumers who receive these accounts cannot shop for them, and tend to use them for a short period of time without reloading—in most cases, the trade association commenter noted, the cards will expire if not used within 60 days. The payment network argued that the proposed pre-acquisition disclosure requirements would delay consumers' receipt of relief funds in the wake of tragic events. In addition, commenters noted that these accounts rarely feature any of the fees that would be required to be disclosed on the proposed short form. Accordingly, these commenters asserted, covering these accounts under the Bureau's final rule on prepaid accounts would increase the cost of providing them to consumers in need for the sake of disclosures that are neither necessary nor useful to those consumers. The national relief organization, which uses prepaid cards to disburse disaster relief funds in some circumstances, noted further that the proposed disclosure requirements in conjunction with the packaging replacement requirements in proposed § 1005.18(h) would render much of its prepaid card inventory useless. A consumer group commenter, by contrast, argued that disaster relief cards should not be excluded so long as they are used in the same way as other prepaid accounts— <em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> as open-loop accounts used to make purchases at multiple, unaffiliated merchants.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees that the nature of these accounts—such as, for example, the fact that the underlying funds are owned by the relief organization, rather than the consumer—warrant their exclusion from the rule. The Bureau believes that such an exclusion is further warranted because, on balance, the burden of requiring these accounts to comply with the requirements of this final rule outweighs the potential utility of those requirements to consumers who have had the misfortune of experiencing a disastrous event. The Bureau does not believe it would be appropriate at this time to place such additional burdens on providers. Accordingly, to further the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account consumers, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to finalize an express exclusion in new § 1005.2(b)(3)(ii)(B) for accounts that are established directly or indirectly by a third party and loaded only with qualified disaster relief payments. This express exclusion will protect consumers by ensuring that they have quick access to crucial funds provided by disaster relief organizations in the wake of tragic events. The Bureau is also adding new comment 2(b)(3)(ii)-2 to clarify that the exclusion is limited to funds made available through a qualified disaster relief program, as that term is defined in the Internal Revenue Code.<footnote ref="309">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 26 U.S.C. 139(b) (defining “qualified disaster relief payment” as, generally, any amount paid to or for the benefit of an individual to reimburse or pay reasonable and necessary expenses incurred as a result of, or for the repair or rehabilitation of property necessitated by, a qualified disaster).</footnote>

      <analysisParagraph>For accounts under Regulation E generally, § 1005.6(a) provides that a consumer may be held liable for an unauthorized EFT resulting from the loss or theft of an access device only if the financial institution has provided certain required disclosures and other conditions are met.<footnote ref="348">The required disclosures for this purpose include a summary of the consumer's liability under § 1005.6, or under State law or other applicable law or agreement, for unauthorized EFTs; the telephone number and address of the person or office to be notified when the consumer believes an unauthorized transfer has been or may be made; and the financial institution's business days. §§ 1005.6(a) and 1005.7(b)(1) through (3).</footnote>

             If timely notice is not given, the consumer's liability is the lesser of $500 or the sum of (1) the lesser of $50 or the amount of unauthorized transfers occurring within two business days of learning of the loss/theft and (2) the amount of unauthorized transfers that occur after two business days but before notice is given to the financial institution.<footnote ref="350">§ 1005.6(b)(2).</footnote>
             Section 1005.6(b)(3) provides, in part, that a consumer must report an unauthorized EFT that appears on a periodic statement within 60 days of the financial institution's transmittal of the statement in order to avoid liability for subsequent transfers.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For government agencies that follow the periodic statement alternative in existing § 1005.15(c), existing § 1005.15(d)(3) provides that for purposes of § 1005.6(b)(3), the 60-day period shall being with the transmittal of a written account history or other account information provided to the consumer under existing § 1005.15(c). Proposed § 1005.15(e)(3) would have modified existing § 1005.15(d)(3) to adjust the timing requirements for reporting unauthorized transfers based on the proposed requirement to provide consumers with electronic account history under proposed § 1005.15(d)(1)(ii), as well as written history upon request. Specifically, proposed § 1005.15(e)(3)(i) would have provided that for purposes of existing § 1005.6(b)(3), the 60-day period for reporting any unauthorized transfer began on the earlier of the date the consumer electronically accessed the consumer's account under proposed § 1005.15(d)(1)(ii), provided that the electronic history made available to the consumer reflected the unauthorized transfer, or the date the agency sent a written history of the consumer's account transactions requested by the consumer under proposed § 1005.15(d)(1)(iii) in which the unauthorized transfer was first reflected.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.15(e)(3)(ii), which mirrored existing § 1005.18(c)(3)(ii) and proposed § 1005.18(e)(1)(ii), would have provided that an agency could comply with proposed § 1005.15(e)(3)(i) by limiting the consumer's liability for an unauthorized transfer as provided under existing § 1005.6(b)(3) for any transfer reported by the consumer within 120 days after the transfer was credited or debited to the consumer's account.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive any comments on this portion of the proposal.

      <title>15(e)(2) Annual Error Resolution Notice</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Mirroring existing § 1005.15(d)(2), proposed § 1005.15(e)(2) would have required that an agency provide an annual notice concerning error resolution that was substantially similar to the notice contained in proposed appendix A-5, in place of the notice required by § 1005.8(b). The Bureau proposed to add that, alternatively, the agency could include on or with each electronic or written history provided in accordance with proposed § 1005.15(d)(1), a notice substantially similar to the abbreviated notice for periodic statements contained in paragraph (b) of appendix A-3, modified as necessary to reflect the error resolution provisions set forth in proposed § 1005.15. The Bureau proposed to allow each electronic and written history to include an abbreviated error resolution notice, in lieu of an annual notice, for parity with proposed § 1005.18(d)(2) for prepaid accounts generally. The Bureau sought comment, however, on whether to continue to require annual error resolution notices for government benefit accounts in certain circumstances, such as when a consumer has not accessed an electronic history or requested a written history in an entire calendar year.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One consumer group commenter urged the Bureau to maintain the requirement that government agencies send annual error resolution notices in connection with government benefit accounts in all instances, regardless of whether the consumer had recently accessed the account. Several industry commenters, including a program manager, an issuing bank, and a trade association, supported the Bureau's decision to allow government agencies to provide an abbreviated error resolution notice on each electronic or written history in lieu of the annual notice. These commenters argued that providing an annual notice is costly, that many such notices get returned to the sender without being opened, and that consumers with dormant accounts who receive these notices may be confused and led to believe that their government benefits were being affected in some way.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has considered the above comments. To further the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account users and pursuant to its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to adopt an adjustment to the error resolution notice requirement of EFTA section 905(a)(7), the Bureau is finalizing the annual error resolution notice requirement in § 1005.15(e)(2) as proposed. As stated in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(d) below, the Bureau continues to believe that its regime for error resolution notices strikes an appropriate balance by providing consumers with enough information to know about and exercise their rights without overwhelming them with more information than they can process or put to use.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(c)(2) Periodic Statement Alternative for Unverified Prepaid Accounts</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting new § 1005.18(c)(2) to provide a modified version of the periodic statement alternative for prepaid accounts that cannot be or have not been verified by the financial institution. Specifically, for prepaid accounts that are not payroll card accounts or government benefit accounts, the final rule does not require a financial institution to provide written account transaction history pursuant to final § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii) for any prepaid account for which the financial institution has not completed its consumer identification and verification process as described in final § 1005.18(e)(3)(i)(A) through (C).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive any comments on this issue, but upon further consideration, believes this modification to the periodic statement alternative would be appropriate, particularly in light of the modifications the Bureau has made to the error resolution requirements for unverified accounts in final § 1005.18(e)(3). The Bureau believes that the limited nature of prepaid accounts that cannot be or have not been verified by a financial institution does not justify requiring financial institutions to provide written account transaction histories upon request for these accounts. The Bureau believes that these accounts do not typically remain active for more than 12 months, and even if they do, they are usually only used to conduct a limited number of transactions. In addition, a financial institution will not likely have a physical address for an unverified prepaid account, and therefore, cannot mail a copy of the consumer's written account transaction history. The Bureau believes, however, that consumers of these accounts still need to have access to balance information by telephone as well as electronic account transaction history in order to manage their accounts.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting new comment 18(c)-6 to provide further guidance on the periodic statement alternative for unverified accounts provided in § 1005.18(c)(2). Specifically, comment 18(c)-6 explains that, if a prepaid account is verified, a financial institution must provide written account transaction history upon the consumer's request that includes the period during which the account was not verified, provided the period is within the 24-month time frame specified in final § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii).</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>For government agencies that follow the periodic statement alternative in existing § 1005.15(c), existing § 1005.15(d)(4) provides that an agency shall comply with the requirements of existing § 1005.11 in response to an oral or written notice of an error from the consumer that is received no later than 60 days after the consumer obtains the written account history or other account information under existing § 1005.15(c) in which the error is first reflected. The Bureau noted in the proposal that this provision only modified the 60-day period for consumers to report an error and did not alter any other provision of § 1005.11.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.15(e)(4) would have modified existing § 1005.15(d)(3) to adjust the timing requirements for reporting errors based on the proposed requirement to provide consumers with electronic account history under proposed § 1005.15(d)(1)(ii), as well as written history upon request. Specifically, proposed § 1005.15(e)(4)(i) would have provided that an agency shall comply with the requirements of existing § 1005.11 in response to an oral or written notice of an error from the consumer that is received by the earlier of 60 days after the date the consumer electronically accessed the consumer's account under proposed § 1005.15(d)(1)(ii), provided that the electronic history made available to the consumer reflected the alleged error, or 60 days after the date the agency sent a written history of the consumer's account transactions requested by the consumer under proposed § 1005.15(d)(1)(iii) in which the alleged error was first reflected.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.15(e)(4)(ii) would have provide that in lieu of following the procedures in proposed § 1005.15(e)(4)(i), an agency complied with the requirements for resolving errors in existing § 1005.11 if it investigated any oral or written notice of an error from the consumer that was received by the agency within 120 days after the transfer allegedly in error was credited or debited to the consumer's account.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 15(e)-1 would have cross-referenced proposed comments 18(d)-1 through -3 for guidance on modified limited liability and error resolution requirements.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive any comments with respect to proposed § 1005.15(e)(4) or comment 15(e)-1. Accordingly, it is finalizing those provisions as proposed. The Bureau is finalizing the proposed provisions to further the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account users and to facilitate compliance with its provisions, and because it believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority pursuant to EFTA section 904(c) to modify the timing requirements of EFTA section 909(a).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As explained in greater detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(e) below, the Bureau has revised its proposed error resolution requirements for prepaid accounts generally in several key respects in the final rule. Specifically, under the final rule, financial institutions that have not completed their consumer identification and verification process with respect to a particular account will still have to investigate and resolve errors reported with respect to that account. However, pursuant to new § 1005.18(e)(3), financial institutions that have not completed the consumer identification and verification process, that completed the process but were not able to verify the account holder's identity, or that do not have a process by which consumers can register their accounts, can take up to the maximum length of time permitted under § 1005.11(c)(2)(i) or (3)(ii), as applicable, to investigate and resolve the error without having to provisionally credit the consumer's account, as required by § 1005.11(c)(2).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The exclusion set forth in final § 1005.18(e)(3) from certain aspects of existing § 1005.11(c)(2) does not apply to government benefit accounts. This is to retain the current application of these rules to government benefit accounts. As the Bureau explained in the proposal, the Bureau understands that the consumer identifying information associated with a government benefit account is collected and verified by the government agency, another financial institution, or a service provider prior to the account's distribution. Therefore, under the final rule, and as discussed in greater detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(e)(3) below, government agencies and other financial institutions must provide full error resolution protections for government benefit accounts, including provisional credit for accounts when investigations of errors take longer than 10 business days, regardless of whether the government benefit account had been registered or the consumer's identity had been verified.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Proposed § 1005.18(g)(1)</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The proposal would have added proposed § 1005.18(g)(1) that generally would have restricted financial institutions that establish or hold prepaid accounts from linking a credit card plan under Regulation Z to a prepaid account, or allowing the prepaid account to be linked to such a credit card plan, until 30 days after the prepaid account has been registered. Specifically, proposed § 1005.18(g)(1)(i) would have restricted financial institutions that establish or hold prepaid accounts from providing solicitations or applications to holders of prepaid accounts to open credit card accounts subject to Regulation Z, prior to 30 days after the prepaid accounts have been registered. For purposes of proposed § 1005.18(g)(1), the term <em data-original="E-03">solicitation</em> would have meant an offer by the person to open a credit or charge card account subject to Regulation Z that does not require the consumer to complete an application. A “firm offer of credit” as defined in section 603(l) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act <footnote ref="516">15 U.S.C. 1681a(l).</footnote>
             for a credit or charge card would be a solicitation for purposes of proposed § 1005.18(g)(1).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(g)(1)(ii) would have restricted financial institutions that establish or hold prepaid accounts of consumers from allowing prepaid access devices to access credit card plans subject to Regulation Z that would make the prepaid access devices into credit cards at any time prior to 30 days after the prepaid accounts have been registered. Proposed § 1005.18(g)(1)(iii) would have restricted financial institutions that establish or hold prepaid accounts of consumers from allowing credit extensions from credit card plans subject to Regulation Z to be deposited in prepaid accounts, where the credit plans are accessed by account numbers that are credit cards under Regulation Z where extensions of credit are permitted to be deposited directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor, prior to 30 days after the prepaid account has been registered. Proposed § 1005.18(g)(1)(iii) was intended to address situations where (1) a separate line of credit is linked to a prepaid account where extensions of credit are permitted to be deposited directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor, (2) the consumer requests an advance on the open-end account using an account number only, and (3) the advance is deposited into the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(g)(1) would have complemented a similar proposed provision in Regulation Z, proposed § 1026.12(h) (renumbered as new § 1026.61(c) in the final rule), which would have required credit card issuers to wait at least 30 days after the prepaid account has been registered before the card issuer may provide a solicitation or an application to the holder of the prepaid account to open a credit or charge card account that will be accessed by the prepaid card that is a credit card under Regulation Z, or by an account number that is a credit card under Regulation Z where extensions of credit are permitted to be deposited directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In the proposal, the Bureau noted that proposed § 1005.18(g)(1) and proposed Regulation Z § 1026.12(h) would have overlapped in cases where the credit card plan is accessed by a prepaid card or the credit card plan is being offered by a financial institution that holds the prepaid account and is accessed by an account number where extensions of credit are permitted to be deposited directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. In those cases, the financial institution would have been a “card issuer” under existing Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(7) <footnote ref="517">Under the proposal, with respect to a prepaid card that is a credit card where the card accesses a credit plan that is offered by a third party, a person offering the credit plan that is accessed by the prepaid card would be an agent of the person issuing the prepaid card and thus would be a card issuer with respect to the prepaid card that is a credit card. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Regulation Z proposed comment 2(a)(7)-1.ii. In this case, both the person offering the credit plan and the financial institution issuing the prepaid card would be card issuers under Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(7).</footnote>
             and the Bureau proposed that both the requirements of proposed Regulation Z § 1026.12(h) and proposed Regulation E § 1005.18(g)(1) would have applied to the financial institution who also is a card issuer. Nonetheless, the Bureau intended proposed Regulation E § 1005.18(g)(1) and proposed Regulation Z § 1026.12(h) to impose the same restrictions in those situations. In cases where the credit card account is being offered by a person other than the person who holds the prepaid account and is being accessed by an account number as described above, the person issuing the account number that is a credit card (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> card issuer) would have been required to comply with proposed Regulation Z § 1026.12(h). In addition, the financial institution that holds the prepaid account would have been required to comply with proposed § 1005.18(g)(1).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has not finalized proposed § 1005.18(g)(1) because the Bureau believes the amendment is unnecessary in light of other revisions in the final rule, as discussed below. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) below, the Regulation Z proposal provided that the term “credit card” would have included an account number that is not a prepaid card that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan that allows deposits directly into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) below, the Bureau has decided not to adopt the provisions related to the account numbers that would have made these account numbers into credit cards under Regulation Z. Thus, the Bureau believes that the provisions in proposed § 1005.18(g)(1) are not needed to address covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards because those credit features are addressed in new Regulation Z § 1026.61(c).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new Regulation Z § 1026.61 and a credit card under final Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New Regulation Z § 1026.61(c) provides that with respect to a covered separate credit feature that could be accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card at any point, a card issuer must not do any of the following until 30 days after the prepaid account has been registered: (1) Open a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card; (2) make a solicitation or provide an application to open a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card; or (3) allow an existing credit feature that was opened prior to the consumer obtaining the prepaid account to become a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>With respect to a hybrid prepaid-credit card, the financial institution would be a “card issuer” under final Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(7).<footnote ref="518">Under the final rule in Regulation Z comment 2(a)(7)-1.ii, with respect to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61where that credit feature is offered by an affiliate or business partner of the prepaid account issuer as those terms are defined in new Regulation Z § 1026.61, the affiliate or business partner offering the credit feature is an agent of the prepaid account issuer and thus, is itself a card issuer with respect to the hybrid prepaid-credit card. In this case, both the person offering the covered separate credit feature and the financial institution issuing the prepaid card are card issuers under final Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(7).</footnote>
             The Bureau does not believe that it is necessary to include similar provisions to proposed § 1005.18(g)(1) in Regulation E that would cover a financial institution that offers a hybrid prepaid-credit card that accesses a covered separate credit feature. In this case, the financial institution is a card issuer under final Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(7) and is covered by the provisions in Regulation Z that apply to card issuers, including new Regulation Z § 1026.61(c).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>31(c)(3) Prominence and Size</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(c)(3) set forth the requirements regarding the prominence and size of the disclosures required under subpart B. The proposed rule provided that written and electronic disclosures required by subpart B must be made in a minimum eight-point font. The Board solicited comment on whether a minimum font size should be required and, if so, whether an eight-point font size is appropriate.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter supported the eight-point font requirement. However, other industry commenters urged the Bureau to eliminate the eight-point font requirement. These commenters argued that the font requirement would add unnecessary compliance costs that did not have a corresponding consumer benefit. Industry commenters argued that the font requirement may not create the desired consistency in disclosures, because, for example, fonts may display differently on different screens and printers. Rather, these commenters believed the Bureau should only require that the disclosures be subject to either a clear and conspicuous or clear and readily understandable standard.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that disclosures should be disclosed in at least an eight-point font, as proposed. As discussed in the proposal, the disclosures that the Board developed for consumer testing used eight-point font, consistent with the font size typically used in register receipts. Participants in the Board's consumer testing generally found that the disclosures were readable, and they were able to locate the different disclosure elements during testing. The Bureau agrees with the Board that disclosures provided in a smaller font could diminish the readability and noticeability of the disclosures. Therefore, the eight-point font requirement is generally retained in the final rule. However, given the particular concerns raised above with respect to mobile disclosures, the final rule does not apply the font requirement to disclosures made by mobile application or text message, to the extent permitted by § 1005.31(a)(5).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(c)(3) further provided that written disclosures required by subpart B must be on the front of the page on which the disclosure is printed. The proposed paragraph also provided that each of the written and electronic disclosures required under proposed § 205.31(b) must be in equal prominence to each other. One industry commenter asked the Bureau to clarify how written and electronic disclosures should be disclosed in equal prominence to each other. As discussed in the proposal, disclosures that must be equally prominent to each other should be displayed in the same font and type size.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting the prominence and size requirement substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(c)(3), with revisions to address the applicability of the font size requirement to mobile applications and text messages and revisions to better clarify that only disclosures provided in writing or electronically must be provided in equal prominence to each other and in eight-point font. Section 1005.31(c)(3) states that written disclosures required by subpart B must be provided on the front of the page on which the disclosure is printed. Disclosures required by subpart B that are provided in writing or electronically must be in a minimum eight-point font, except for disclosures provided via mobile application or text message to the extent permitted by § 1005.31(a)(5).

      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.32(b) contained the permanent exception set forth in EFTA section 919(c). Under EFTA section 919(c), if the Bureau determines that a recipient nation does not legally allow, or the method by which transactions are made to the recipient country do not allow, a remittance transfer provider to know the amount of currency that will be received, the Bureau may issue rules to permit the remittance transfer provider to provide a reasonably accurate estimate. The Board's proposal specifically noted that there is at least one recipient country where a particular method of remittances do not allow remittance transfer providers to know the amount of currency that will be received.<footnote ref="80">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 76 FR 29923.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In light of that determination, the proposed rule allowed estimates to be provided for amounts required to be disclosed under proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(iv) through (vii) for transfers to certain countries. Like the temporary exception in EFTA section 919(a)(4), the permanent exception in EFTA section 919(c) only addresses estimates for the amount of currency that will be received by a designated recipient. For the reasons described above with respect to the temporary exception, proposed § 205.32(b) also permitted disclosure of estimates for the exchange rate, the transfer amount in the currency made available to the designated recipient, and taxes imposed in the recipient country that are a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient. The Bureau did not receive any comments on this aspect of the proposal. For the reasons set forth above with regard to the temporary exception and to effectuate the purposes of EFTA and facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to adopt this proposed permanent exception in § 1005.32(b).</analysisParagraph>

        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.32(b)(1) allowed estimates to be provided for the exchange rate, transfer amount, other fees and taxes, and total to recipient disclosures (adopted as § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) through (vii) above), if a remittance transfer provider cannot determine exact amounts because the laws of the recipient country do not permit such a determination.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters raised concerns about whether remittance transfer providers have the resources to determine whether this exception applies. Consumer group commenters argued that the statute requires the Bureau to determine which recipient countries qualify for the permanent exception, rather than leaving the determination to individual market participants. Both industry and consumer group commenters recommended that the Bureau maintain a list of countries or a database, updated annually, to which the permanent exception based on the laws of a recipient country would apply.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that it is appropriate for remittance transfer providers to identify and comply with a recipient country's currency laws. The Bureau also believes that remittance transfer providers and their correspondents generally are able to obtain this information because they are engaged in the business of remittance transfers to recipient countries and must comply with any applicable law that prevents the remittance transfer provider from determining exchange rates or exact amounts. Nonetheless, in response to comments received and upon further consideration, the Bureau is revising proposed § 205.32(b) to facilitate compliance by providing a safe harbor list of countries which qualify for the permanent exception.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, the Bureau is renumbering proposed § 205.32(b) as § 1005.32(b)(1) and adopting new § 1005.32(b)(2) to provide a safe harbor. New § 1005.32(b)(2) states that a remittance transfer provider may rely on the list of countries published by the Bureau to determine whether estimates may be provided under the permanent exception, unless the provider has information that a country's laws or the method by which transactions are conducted in that country permits a determination of the exact disclosure amount.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau is adopting commentary on new § 1005.32(b)(2). New comment 32(b)-5 provides guidance on the safe harbor list published by the Bureau. New comment 32(b)-6 provides further guidance on reliance on the Bureau-provided list of countries that qualify for the permanent exception. New comment 32(b)-7 addresses circumstance where there is a change in laws of the recipient country.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 32(b)(1)-1 clarified that the “laws of the recipient country” do not permit a remittance transfer provider to determine exact amounts when a law or regulation of the recipient country requires the person making funds directly available to the designated recipient to apply an exchange rate that is: (i) Set by the government of the recipient country after the remittance transfer provider sends the remittance transfer; or (ii) set when the designated recipient chooses to claim the funds. Comment 32(b)(1)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed, but renumbered as comment 32(b)-1 for organizational purposes.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One commenter requested clarification about whether proposed comment 32(b)(1)-1 covered instances where the local currency is thinly traded and the laws of a recipient country require an authorized dealer to set the exchange rate when the remittance transfer is received. The Bureau believes that the proposed comment already covers such circumstances because the government of the recipient country, acting through an authorized dealer, sets the exchange rate after the remittance transfer has been sent. In addition, the transfer may also qualify for the permanent exception if the exchange rate is required by law to be set by the authorized dealer when the recipient claims the funds.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comments 32(b)(1)-2.i. and 32(b)(1)-2.ii. provided examples illustrating the application of the exception. Proposed comment 32(b)(1)-2.i. explained that the laws of the recipient country do not permit a remittance transfer provider to determine the exact exchange rate required to be disclosed under proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(iv) (adopted as § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) above) when, for example, the government of the recipient country sets the exchange rate daily and the funds are made available to the designated recipient in the local currency the day after the remittance transfer provider sends the remittance transfer. Under such circumstances, an estimate for the exchange rate would be permitted because the remittance transfer provider cannot determine a rate that a foreign government has yet to set.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In contrast, proposed comment 32(b)(1)-2.ii. explained that the laws of the recipient country permit a remittance transfer provider to determine the exact exchange rate required to be disclosed under proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(iv) (adopted as § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) above) if, for example, the government of the recipient country ties the value of its currency to the U.S. dollar. The Bureau did not receive significant comment on comment 32(b)(1)-2.

        <title>32(b)(1)(ii) Method by Which Transactions are Made in the Recipient Country</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.32(b)(2) allowed estimates to be provided for the exchange rate, transfer amount, other fees and taxes, and total to recipient disclosures (adopted as § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) through (vii) above), if a remittance transfer provider cannot determine exact amounts because the method by which transactions are made in the recipient country does not permit such a determination.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Based on the Board's outreach and interpretation of the statute, the Board stated its belief that the exception for methods by which transactions are made in the recipient country under proposed § 205.32(b)(2) was intended to permit estimates for certain international ACH transactions. Specifically, the Board interpreted the exception under § 205.32(b)(2) to apply to remittances sent via international ACH on terms negotiated by the government of the United States and the government of a recipient country where the exchange rate is set after the transfer is sent. Accordingly, proposed comment 32(b)(2)-1 stated that the “method by which transactions are made in the recipient country” does not permit a remittance transfer provider to determine exact amounts when transactions are sent via international ACH on terms negotiated between the United States government and the recipient country's government, under which the exchange rate is set by the recipient country's central bank after the provider sends the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters argued that the Bureau should adopt a broader reading of the statute, and that international wire transfers should be covered by the permanent exception. These commenters argued that international wire transfers are a method by which transactions are made in a recipient country that does not allow the remittance transfer provider to know the amount of currency that will be received by a designated recipient and should thus qualify for the permanent exception. One industry commenter stated that the permanent exception is helpful for certain international ACH transactions; however, the benefit is limited by the number of recipient countries that participate in the Federal Reserve System's FedGlobal ACH program. Other industry commenters requested that all international ACH transfers be covered by the permanent exception and that the exception should not be limited to those that are sent on terms negotiated between the United States government and the recipient country's government. These commenters noted that all cross-border ACH transfers, regardless of how the exchange rate is set, are subject to similar difficulties as certain international ACH transfers that qualify for the permanent exception. Consumer group commenters supported the proposal's application of the permanent exception based on the method to certain international ACH transfers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In each case, the Bureau agrees with the Board's interpretation. The Bureau believes that extending the permanent exception to international wire transfers and all international ACH transactions would be inconsistent with the statutory language and purpose of the provision, which specifically refers to methods of transfer <em data-original="E-03">in a recipient country</em> (emphasis added). The Bureau must give meaning to this phrase, and does not believe that the interpretation urged by commenters is dependent on a method of transfer in a particular country.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe that the permanent exception in EFTA section 919(c) applies to international wire transfers because wire transfers are not a method that is particular to a specific country or group of countries. Rather, compliance challenges may arise due to the international wire transfer business model, which is based on a chain of correspondents and two-party contractual relationships.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, the application of the permanent exception to international wire transfers and ACH transactions generally would make the temporary exception superfluous. As discussed above, the statute is broad in scope, specifically covering transactions that are account-based and that are not electronic fund transfers, and therefore, covers open network transactions. Further, as described above with regard to the temporary exception, the statute specifically permits the use of estimates by depository institutions and credit unions for certain account-based transactions. If all open network transactions were included in the permanent exception, there would be no need for the temporary exception because nearly all, if not all, the types of transfers that qualify for the temporary exception would be covered by the permanent exception. The Bureau does not believe the temporary exception is superfluous. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to extend the permanent exception to these transactions.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One commenter argued that the permanent exception for method of transfer should also include instances when the remittance transfer provider and the sender agree to have the exchange rate set at some point in the future (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> floating rate products). As with wire transfers, such an agreement is not a method by which a transaction is made that is particular to a specific country or group of countries. Therefore, the Bureau also believes that this circumstance would not be eligible for the permanent exception. The Bureau notes, however, that the remittance transfer provider that is party to such an agreement may provide estimates of the exchange rate if the remittance transfer provider qualifies for the temporary exception in § 1005.32(a). For the reasons discussed above, proposed § 205.32(b)(2) is adopted as proposed in renumbered § 1005.32(b)(1)(ii). Proposed comment 32(b)(2)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed with clarifying revision, but renumbered as comment 32(b)-3 for organizational purposes.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 32(b)(2)-2 provided examples illustrating the application of the permanent exception. The comment is adopted substantially as proposed, but renumbered as comment 32(b)-4 for organizational purposes. Comment 32(b)-4.i. provides an example of when a remittance transfer would qualify for the exception. The Bureau notes that some comments received indicate that there may be confusion as to the application of the permanent exception provided in § 1005.32(b)(1)(ii) to any transfer sent via international ACH. However, comment 32(b)-4.i. explains that a transfer would only qualify for the exception when sent via international ACH on terms negotiated between the United States government and the recipient country's government, under which the exchange rate is a rate set by the recipient country's central bank or other governmental authority on the business day after the provider has sent the remittance transfer. Under such circumstances, the provider cannot determine the exact exchange rate required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv). Thus, remittance transfers sent via Directo a México currently would qualify for the permanent exception in § 1005.32(b)(1)(ii). Accordingly, proposed comment 32(b)-4.i. is adopted substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comments 32(b)(2)-2.ii. and -2.iii. provided examples of when a remittance transfer would not qualify for the permanent exception in § 1005.32(b)(1)(ii). The Bureau did not receive significant comment on the proposed comments, which are adopted substantially as proposed, with technical and clarifying edits, in renumbered comments 32(b)-4.ii. and 32(b)-4.iii. Comment 32(b)-4.ii. explains that a remittance transfer provider is not permitted to provide estimates under the permanent exception if it sends a remittance transfer via international ACH on terms negotiated between the United States government and a private-sector entity in the recipient country, under which the exchange rate is set by the institution acting as the entry point to the recipient country's payments system on the next business day. In this case, transactions are made using a method negotiated between the United States and a private entity. Nonetheless, remittance transfers sent using such a method may qualify for the temporary exception in § 1005.32(a). Comment 32(b)-4.iii. explains that a remittance transfer provider does not qualify for the permanent exception if, for example, it sends transfers via international ACH on terms negotiated between the United States government and the recipient country's government, under which the exchange rate is set by the recipient country's central bank or other governmental authority before the sender requests a transfer. In such a case, the remittance transfer provider can determine the exchange rate required to be disclosed.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>32(c) Bases for Estimates</title>
      <analysisParagraph>If a remittance transfer qualifies for either the temporary exception in EFTA section 919(a)(4) or the permanent exception in EFTA section 919(c), the statute permits the provider to disclose a reasonably accurate estimate to the sender. Proposed § 205.32(c) stated that estimates provided pursuant to the exceptions in proposed § 205.32(a) and (b) (adopted as § 1005.32(a) and (b) above) must be based on an approach listed in the regulation for the required disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.32(c) further stated that if a remittance transfer provider bases an estimate on an approach that is not listed, the provider complies with proposed § 205.32(c) so long as the designated recipient receives the same, or greater, amount of currency that it would have received had the estimate been based on a listed approach. Thus, use of an approach other than one listed in the proposed rule is compliant with the regulation if the sender is not harmed by such use.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters generally requested greater flexibility in estimating exchange rates and fees. For example, commenters recommended less prescriptive approaches, such as permitting remittance transfer providers to base estimates on reasonably available information, adopting a reasonably accurate standard, or adopting a safe harbor for good faith estimates within a specified tolerance. The Bureau generally concurs with the Board's reasoning in the May 2011 Proposed Rule that providing a list of approaches for calculating estimates would be more helpful to remittance transfer providers and consumers than a less specific standard for calculating estimates. The Bureau believes that requiring estimates be provided based on an approach listed in the regulation will facilitate compliance with the final rule. However, in response to comments received, the Bureau is clarifying proposed § 205.32(c). The safe harbor in proposed § 205.32(c) was intended to provide greater flexibility and to facilitate compliance for remittance transfer providers that may base an estimate on an approach that is not listed in the rule. However, the Bureau notes that under the proposal, the provider would have been required to compare any estimate based on its own approach with an estimate based on a listed approach in order to determine whether the sender would be harmed by such use. The Bureau believes that this comparison would unnecessarily increase the burden of using an unlisted approach and render the safe harbor meaningless. Therefore, the Bureau revises proposed § 205.32(c) to state that if a provider bases an estimate on an approach not listed in the rule, the provider is deemed to be in compliance with the rule so long as the designated recipient receives the same, or greater, amount of funds than the remittance transfer provider disclosed as required under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii). The Bureau believes that this clarification also ensures that the sender is not harmed because the amount of funds received by the designated recipient will be the same or greater than the estimated total amount received as required to be disclosed under § 1005.32(b)(1)(vii). Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 205.32(c) as § 1005.32(c) with amendment.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>32(c)(1) Exchange Rate</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.32(c)(1) set forth the approaches that a remittance transfer provider may use as the basis of an estimate of the exchange rate required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv). The final rule adopts the proposed rule as § 1005.32(c)(1), with modifications and additional commentary to address issues raised in comments.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The approach in proposed § 205.32(c)(1)(i) stated that for remittance transfers qualifying for the § 1005.32(b)(1)(ii) exception, the estimate must be based on the most recent exchange rate set by the recipient country's central bank and reported by a Federal Reserve Bank. Proposed comment 32(c)(1)(i)-1 clarified that if the exchange rate for a remittance transfer sent via international ACH that qualifies for the proposed § 205.32(b)(2) exception is set the following business day, the most recent exchange rate available for a transfer will be the exchange rate set for the day that the disclosure is provided, <em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the current business day's exchange rate. Consumer group commenters generally supported proposed § 205.32(c)(1)(i) and its commentary. Other commenters believed that the application of the proposed § 205.32(b)(2) exception should be broadened generally, as discussed above. Accordingly, proposed § 205.32(c)(1)(i) is adopted as proposed in renumbered § 1005.32(c)(1)(i). Comment 32(c)(1)(i)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed, but renumbered as comment 32(c)(1)-1 for organizational purposes.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The approach in proposed § 205.32(c)(1)(ii) provided that, for other transfers, the estimate must be based on the most recent publicly available wholesale exchange rate. Industry commenters argued that the wholesale interbank exchange rate would not be the rate actually applied to a consumer's remittance transfer, so using the wholesale exchange rate as an estimate would be misleading to consumers. For instance, basing an estimate on only the wholesale rate could consistently overestimate the amount of currency received by a recipient because the wholesale rate does not account for any spread applied to the rate for a sender's remittance transfer to a particular country. One commenter noted that estimates of exchange rates may be based on information from foreign exchange dealers as well as rates available in the marketplace.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Based on comments received and upon further analysis, the Bureau is adopting a revised basis for estimates in renumbered § 1005.32(c)(1)(ii) and its related commentary to address concerns regarding the proposed use of a wholesale exchange rate. Specifically, § 1005.32(c)(1)(ii) provides that, in disclosing the exchange rate as required under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), an estimate must be based on the most recent publicly available wholesale rate and, if applicable, the spread typically applied to such a rate by the remittance transfer provider or its correspondent to the wholesale rate for remittance transfers for a particular currency. The Bureau believes the revised subsection will result in an estimated exchange rate that better approximates the “retail” rate that will apply to a sender's remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 32(c)(1)-3 provides guidance on applying any spread to the estimate of an exchange rate based on the wholesale exchange rate. If a remittance transfer provider uses the most recent wholesale exchange rate as a basis for an estimate of an exchange rate, the exchange rate estimate must also reflect any spread that is typically applied to such a rate for remittance transfers for a particular currency. For example, assume a remittance transfer provider (or its correspondent) typically applies a spread, such as a fixed percentage, to a wholesale rate in order to determine the exchange rate offered to a sender for remittance transfers for a particular currency. If the provider must estimate an exchange rate for another remittance transfer for the same currency, the remittance transfer provider must estimate the exchange rate by applying the same spread (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> fixed percentage) to the most recent publicly available wholesale rate.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 32(c)(1)(ii)-1 provided that publicly available sources of information containing the most recent wholesale exchange rate for a currency include, for example, U.S. news services, such as Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal, and the New York Times; a recipient country's national news service; and a recipient country's central bank or other government agency. The Bureau did not receive any comments on this aspect of the proposal. One industry commenter, however, noted that for currency exchange rates not listed by a U.S. news service, remittance transfer providers could rely on the basis for estimates provided under proposed § 205.32(c)(1)(iii). Accordingly, proposed comment 32(c)(1)(ii)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed, but renumbered as comment 32(c)(1)-2 for organizational purposes.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters, however, stated that it was unclear which most recent publicly available wholesale exchange rate should apply because rates may fluctuate throughout the day and may be published on a Web site in addition to the rate that may be available in a news service publication. Based on these comments, the Bureau is adopting new comment 32(c)(1)-4 to provide guidance when an exchange rate for a currency is published or provided multiple times within a day. Specifically, comment 32(c)(1)-4 clarifies that if the exchange rate for a currency is published or provided multiple times throughout the day because the exchange rate fluctuates throughout the day, a remittance transfer provider may use any exchange rate available on that day for the purposes of determining the “most recent” exchange rate.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The approach in proposed § 205.32(c)(1)(iii) permitted the use of the most recent exchange rate offered by the person making funds available directly to the designated recipient as the basis for providing an estimate. However, in some instances the exchange rate used for a transfer may be set by other institutions, such as a foreign ACH counterpart or an intermediary institution in a transmittal route that is not a correspondent institution. For example, the first intermediary institution in the transmittal route that is in the recipient country may set the exchange rate and conduct the currency exchange before transmitting the remittance transfer to the recipient institution, which then makes the funds available to the designated recipient. Therefore, upon further consideration, proposed § 205.32(c)(1)(iii), in renumbered § 1005.32(c)(1)(iii), is revised to state that an estimate may be also based on the most recent exchange rate offered or used by the person in the transmittal route setting the exchange rate. The Bureau notes that § 1005.32(c)(1)(iii), as revised, addresses circumstances in which the local currency is infrequently traded or when wholesale exchange rates would not have been publicly available.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>32(c)(3) Other Fees</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.32(c)(3) provided that one of two approaches must be used to estimate the fees imposed by intermediary institutions in connection with an international wire transfer required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). Under the first approach, an estimate must be based on the remittance transfer provider's most recent transfer to an account at the designated recipient's institution. Under the second approach, an estimate must be based on the representations of the intermediary institutions along a representative route identified by the remittance transfer provider that the requested transfer could travel.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 32(c)(3)(ii)-1 clarified that a remittance transfer from a sender's account at an insured institution to the designated recipient's institution may take several routes, depending on the correspondent relationships each institution in the transmittal route has with other institutions. Proposed comment 32(c)(3)(ii)-1 further clarified that, in providing an estimate of the fees required to be disclosed under proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(vi) pursuant to the temporary exception, an insured institution may rely upon the representations of the institutions that act as intermediaries in any one of the potential transmittal routes that it reasonably believes a requested remittance transfer may travel.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters argued that insured institutions do not know what other fees an intermediary institution or the designated recipient's institution may charge. For example, a remittance transfer provider may not know the fees a receiving institution may charge its own customers for receiving a remittance transfer. Another commenter suggested that some small insured institutions may be unaware of the number of intermediary institutions involved in the transmittal route. Commenters also argued that it would be difficult to obtain sufficient information to be able to disclose any estimates, and that the requirement would impose operational burden on insured institutions, particularly on insured institutions that do not send international wire transfers frequently or are unable to obtain representations of intermediary institutions.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau believes that, consistent with the statute, it is appropriate to require remittance transfer providers to disclose fees imposed by intermediary institutions or the designated recipient's institution in order to determine the amount of currency received by the recipient. The Bureau further believes that the rule provides sufficient flexibility to facilitate compliance and that representative transmittal routes are readily determinable. In addition, the Bureau notes that a remittance transfer provider may be required to estimate other fees as required by § 1005.32(b)(1)(vi) in other circumstances. For example, if a remittance transfer provider estimates the exchange rate under the § 1005.32(b) permanent exception, a provider may be required to estimate other fees that are imposed as a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient. Therefore, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to provide additional clarification. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting a new § 1005.32(c)(3)(i) to provide that for other fees that are imposed as a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient, an estimate must be based on the estimated exchange rate provided in accordance with § 1005.32(c)(1), prior to any rounding of the estimated exchange rate. Furthermore, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 205.32(c)(3) with a technical revision in renumbered § 1005.32(c)(3)(ii). Comment 32(c)(3)(ii)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed, but is renumbered as comment 32(c)(3)-1 for organizational purposes.</analysisParagraph>

Proposed comment 32(c)(4)-1 clarified that proposed § 205.32(c)(4) permits a provider to give an estimate only when the taxes imposed in a recipient country are a percentage of the amount transferred to the designated recipient. In other contexts where taxes may be imposed, a remittance transfer provider can determine the exact amount, such as in the case of a tax of a specific amount. The Bureau did not receive comments on this aspect of the proposal. Accordingly, proposed § 205.32(c)(4) is adopted in renumbered § 1005.32(c)(4) with revisions for consistency with amended §§ 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) and 1005.32(c)(3). The Bureau is revising comment 32(c)(4)-1 to clarify that a remittance transfer provider can determine the exact amount of other taxes that are a percentage of the amount transferred if the provider can determine the exchange rate and the exact amount of other fees imposed on the remittance transfer.

      <title>32(c) and (d) Bases for Estimates</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The February Proposal sought comment on the appropriate method to calculate estimates of exchange rates, and related figures, under the proposed exception for remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer. However, the Bureau did not propose specific changes to § 1005.32(c), which concerns the allowable bases for estimates of required disclosures.<footnote ref="15">In the February Proposal, the Bureau did propose conforming changes to comment 32(c)(3)-1 that referenced the renumbered provisions relating to the permanent exception for transfers to certain countries (what is § 1005.32(b)(1) in the final rule). The Bureau received no comments on the proposed changes to this comment, and the Bureau is adopting it as proposed.</footnote>
             The Bureau received a few comments on this issue but none that suggested revisions to § 1005.32(c). However, in order to allow remittance transfer providers to give estimates for transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer and to make those estimates more useful for consumers, the Bureau believes revisions to the allowable bases for such estimates are necessary for disclosures that contain estimates pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2). These changes are adopted in a new § 1005.32(d).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The February Final Rule contains, in § 1005.32(c)(1), three specific approaches by which a remittance transfer provider may estimate an exchange rate when using the exceptions for estimates in § 1005.32(a) and (b) (now renumbered as (b)(1)). Section 1005.32(c) further allows a provider to use an estimation approach not listed in § 1005.32(c)(1) so long as the designated recipient receives the same, or greater, amount of funds than the remittance transfer provider disclosed, as required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii). Under, the February Proposal, the bases for determining estimates under proposed § 1005.32(b)(2) would have been the same as the bases for determining estimates under the existing provisions permitting estimates in the February Final Rule (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> § 1005.32(c)).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In commenting on proposed § 1005.32(b)(2), industry commenters noted that if allowed, the most likely way that they would “estimate” the future exchange rate would be by providing the actual rate available on the day of scheduling to customers sending same-day transfers. One commenter explained that while they could always disclose the actual rate available on the date the transfer is scheduled, the commenter cautioned that many variables could alter exchange rates over time. Furthermore, industry commenters stated that they believed that senders typically do little comparison shopping when scheduling transfers before the date of transfer and instead are more interested in reliable and timely transfers from a remittance transfer provider that the senders trust.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>To clarify the proper bases for disclosing estimates, the Bureau adds § 1005.32(d), which states that estimates provided pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2) must be based on the exchange rate or, where applicable, the estimated exchange rate based on an estimation methodology permitted under § 1005.32(c) that the provider would have used or did use that day in providing disclosures to a sender requesting such a remittance transfer to be made on the same day. If, in accordance with § 1005.32(d), a remittance transfer provider uses a basis described in § 1005.32(c) but not listed in § 1005.32(c)(1), the provider is deemed to be in compliance with § 1005.32(d) regardless of the amount received by the designated recipient, so long as the estimation methodology is the same as that the provider would have used or did use in providing disclosures to a sender requesting such a remittance transfer to be made on the same day.<footnote ref="16">Section 1005.32(c)(1) contains three methodologies for providing estimates. If a provider chooses to use a non-listed method, § 1005.32(c) explains that the amount received by the designated recipient must be the same, or greater then, the estimated amount disclosed to the sender.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is making two changes to the bases for estimates applicable to the exception for estimates for remittance transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer. The first requires providers to base estimates on the exchange rate (or estimated exchange rate) that the provider would have used or did use that day in providing disclosures to a sender requesting such a remittance transfer to be made on the same day. In order to allow for easier comparison shopping and for estimates to be of use to senders, the Bureau believes that remittance transfer providers should base their estimates on similar methodologies. The Bureau believes that if providers uniformly disclose the actual rate available that day as the estimated rate for transfers scheduled before the date of transfer, senders will more easily be able to compare the offerings of various remittance transfer providers by comparing rates and fees. Moreover, commenters did not suggest any other reliable method to estimate future exchange rates.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The second change concerns estimates pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2) by remittance transfer providers that can otherwise use the two statutory exceptions in § 1005.32(a) or (b)(1). As explained above, providers of transfers scheduled before the date of transfer who cannot use one of the enumerated methods for estimating in § 1005.32(c)(1) will have difficulties guaranteeing that the designated recipient receives the same, or greater, amount of funds than the remittance transfer provider disclosed. The Bureau is concerned about remittance transfer providers that use estimates pursuant to § 1005.32(a) or (b)(1), and that, as permitted by § 1005.32(c), have chosen to use an estimation methodology other than those specified in § 1005.32(c)(1). With regard to such methodologies, § 1005.32(c) requires that if a provider bases an estimate on an approach that is not listed in that paragraph, the provider is deemed to be in compliance with the paragraph so long as the designated recipient receive the same, or greater, amount of funds than the provider disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii). The Bureau is concerned that due to the fluctuations in wholesale foreign exchange markets discussed above, in many cases, remittance transfer providers that have developed estimation methodologies that reliably satisfy the requirements of § 1005.32(c) for same-day transfers, may not be able to do the same for estimates of exchange rates provided for transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of a remittance transfer. The Bureau also recognizes that the elimination of this guarantee will reduce burden on providers.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau expects that most remittance transfer providers, if allowed, will set the retail exchange rate that applies to a remittance transfer scheduled before the date of transfer on the date of that transfer, in rough reference to one of several measures of the wholesale or market exchange rates. Insofar as there are a large number of factors that may alter exchange rates, the Bureau believes that in most scenarios, there is no method to predict with precision what those market or wholesale rates will be far before the date on which a remittance transfer provider sets a retail exchange rate. Thus, the requirement in § 1005.32(c) that providers who cannot use a listed methodology guarantee that the amount received by the designated recipient must be the same, or greater than, the estimated amounts disclosed to the sender, is not feasible for disclosures provided five or more business days before the date of transfer. Nevertheless, because providers must use the same method for transfers scheduled before the date of transfers as they use for same-day transfers, the Bureau believes there will still be consistency in the estimation methodology.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 32(d)-1 explains that when providing an estimate pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2), § 1005.32(d) requires that a remittance transfer provider's estimated exchange rate must be the exchange rate (or estimated exchange rate) that the remittance transfer provider would have used or did use that day in providing disclosures to a sender requesting such a remittance transfer to be made on the same day. If, for the same-day remittance transfer, the provider could utilize either of the other two exceptions permitting the provision of estimates in § 1005.32(a) or (b)(1), the provider may provide estimates based on a methodology permitted under § 1005.32(c). For example, if, on February 1, the sender schedules a remittance transfer to occur on February 10, the provider should disclose the exchange rate as if the sender was requesting the transfer be sent on February 1. However, if at the time payment is made for the requested transfer, the remittance transfer provider could not send any remittance transfer until the next day (for reasons such as the provider's deadline for the batching of transfers), the remittance transfer provider can use the rate (or estimated exchange rate) that the remittance transfer provider would have used or did use in providing disclosures that day with respect to a remittance transfer requested that day that could not be sent until the following day.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(ii) required that a remittance transfer provider disclose any fees and taxes that are imposed on the remittance transfer by the remittance transfer provider, in the currency in which the funds will be transferred. The proposal stated that the disclosure must be described using the term “Transfer Fees,” “Transfer Taxes,” or “Transfer Fees and Taxes,” or a substantially similar term. These disclosures were proposed pursuant to EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(ii), which requires a remittance transfer provider to disclose the amount of transfer fees and any other fees charged by the remittance transfer provider for the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.i. clarified that taxes imposed by the remittance transfer provider include taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a State or other governmental body. The proposed comment also provided guidance applicable to the disclosure of both fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider, as well as fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, which are discussed in detail below. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), below. The proposed comment addressed the requirement that a remittance transfer provider only disclose fees or taxes as applicable. The proposed comment also stated that if both fees and taxes are imposed, the fees and taxes may be disclosed as one disclosure or as separate, itemized disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters and an industry commenter argued that the Bureau should require itemized fees and tax disclosures. They believed itemized disclosures would help senders understand what costs are fixed, such as taxes, and what costs may vary depending on the provider, such as fees. However, another industry commenter stated that disclosing fees and taxes together provided senders with adequate information on the total cost of the transaction.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees that separately listing the fees and taxes on disclosures provides better information to the sender about fixed and variable costs of the transaction, and the final rule provides that fees and taxes must be disclosed separately. Section 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) also clarifies that the fees and taxes must be disclosed in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(b)(1)(i), above. Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) states that a remittance transfer provider must disclose any fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider, in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, using the terms “Transfer Fees” for fees and “Transfer Taxes” for taxes or substantially similar terms. Comment 31(b)(1)-1.i. in the final rule is changed from the proposal to state that if both fees and taxes are imposed, the fees and taxes must be disclosed as separate, itemized disclosures. For example, a provider would disclose all transfer fees using the term “Transfer Fees” or a substantially similar term and would separately disclose all transfer taxes as “Transfer Taxes” or a substantially similar term.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter argued that because a tax is imposed by the government, and not by the remittance transfer provider, EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(ii) does not require taxes to be disclosed and, as such, the rule should not require disclosure of taxes. The Bureau believes the statute intended to require the disclosure of all charges imposed on the remittance transfer that would affect the cost of a remittance transfer to the sender. To the extent taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a State or other governmental body are charged to the sender by the remittance transfer provider, the Bureau believes they are required to be disclosed under EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(ii), which requires a remittance transfer provider to disclose transfer fees and any other fees charged by the remittance transfer provider for the remittance transfer. Even if EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(ii) did not require that such taxes be disclosed to senders, the Bureau believes that disclosing the taxes imposed on the remittance transfer will demonstrate to the sender the calculation of the total amount that the sender pays for the transfer and how this amount relates to amount that will be received by the designated recipient and is therefore necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA. As such, to the extent necessary, the Bureau is also requiring these taxes to be disclosed pursuant to its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c). Therefore, as proposed, comment 31(b)(1)-1.i. in the final rule clarifies that taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the remittance transfer provider include taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a State or other governmental body.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, as proposed, comment 31(b)(1)-1.i. addresses the disclosure of fees and taxes that are applicable to the transfer. The comment in the final rule states that a provider need only disclose fees or taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider in § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) and imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), as applicable. For example, if no transfer taxes are imposed on a remittance transfer, a provider would only disclose applicable transfer fees.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii. distinguished between the fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider and the fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider. This proposed comment is addressed in the discussion regarding fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), below.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>31(b)(1)(ii) Fees Imposed and Taxes Collected by the Provider</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) of the 2012 Final Rule states that a remittance transfer provider must disclose any fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider, in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, using the terms “Transfer Fees” for fees and “Transfer Taxes” for taxes or substantially similar terms.  Since the Board's initial proposal, commenters have argued that because a tax is imposed by a government, and not by the provider, this provision may be confusing.  The Bureau agrees that the original formulation may be inexact insofar as taxes are typically imposed by governments, even though they may be collected by providers.  As a result, for clarity, the Bureau is revising this language to refer to taxes “collected” by the provider.  This change is for clarification only and is not intended to change the meaning of the provision in the 2012 Final Rule.  Consequently, § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) of the 2013 Final Rule is revised to state, more precisely, that a provider must disclose any fees imposed and any taxes collected on the remittance transfer by the provider.<footnote ref="5">The Bureau has made conforming changes throughout the 2013 Final Rule.</footnote>

      <title>18(b)(2)(vii) Inactivity Fee</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">7</em>) would have required disclosure of a fee for non-use, dormancy, or inactivity on a prepaid account, using the term “Inactivity fee” or a substantially similar term, as well as the duration of inactivity that triggers a financial institution to impose such an inactivity fee. The Bureau believed that many financial institutions charge consumers fees when they do not use their prepaid accounts for a specified period of time. The Bureau believed disclosure of these fees is important insofar as consumers sometimes acquire a prepaid account for occasional use; such consumers may want to know that a particular prepaid account program charges fees for inactivity.<footnote ref="394">In the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing, several participants mentioned only using their prepaid cards occasionally.</footnote>
             Thus, the Bureau proposed that financial institutions disclose the existence, duration, and amount of inactivity fees, or that no such fee will be charged, as part the short form disclosure. The Bureau also noted in the proposal, however, that, as with all the disclosures in the short form, the requirement to disclose a particular fee type was not an endorsement of such a fee.<footnote ref="395">The Bureau understands that some States bar or limit inactivity fees, and nothing in this final rule is meant to preempt any such State laws.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">7</em>)-1 would have clarified that when disclosing the inactivity fee pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii)(A) as part of the long form disclosure, a financial institution should specify whether this inactivity fee was imposed in lieu of or in addition to the periodic fee disclosed pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>). The Bureau believed that a lower inactivity fee may correlate with a prepaid account product imposing a higher monthly periodic fee on a consumer. Thus, consumers using a prepaid account only sporadically, but often enough to not reach the dormancy period that would trigger the inactivity fee, might actually incur higher fees if they shop based on the inactivity fee instead of the monthly periodic fee. In preparing the proposal, the Bureau considered whether the risk of potential confusion to a consumer outweighed the benefit of including the inactivity fee on the short form disclosure, but believed that providing consumers with the inactivity fee amount and the relevant duration of dormancy would allow consumers to make an informed choice about which prepaid account product is best for their usage patterns.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received comments from a program manager, an issuing bank, an industry trade association, a consumer group, and an office of a State Attorney General about the proposed inactivity fee disclosure. In response to the Bureau's solicitation of comments as to whether inactivity fees should be included in the short form disclosure, the program manager responded that disclosure of both the monthly fee and the inactivity fee would not confuse consumers, as most prepaid products either charge a monthly fee or an inactivity fee, but not both. Even if both fees are charged, it said, consumers can get more information about the fees from the long form disclosure or on the Web site associated with the prepaid program disclosed on the short form. In contrast, the trade association and the issuing bank urged the Bureau not to require disclosure of inactivity fees because, they said, both studies of prepaid cards that they reviewed and information provided to the trade association by its members indicate that inactivity fees are not commonly charged. Additionally, the commenters said there are better means than the short form through which consumers can learn about inactivity fees, such as the Bureau's Web site, the prepaid issuer's Web site or its customer service, and that contact information for those sources is included in the short form disclosure. The consumer group and the office of a State Attorney General recommended primarily that the Bureau ban inactivity fees, but otherwise generally supported the disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The consumer group also asserted that the portion of proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">7</em>)-1 directing financial institutions to include in the long form disclosure whether an inactivity fee is charged in lieu of or in addition to the periodic fee disclosure implied the Bureau's implicit endorsement of charging of both a periodic fee and an inactivity fee—a practice the consumer group opposed. The consumer group also stated that the inactivity fee can be known as “dormancy” or “maintenance” fees, and that the Bureau should require standardized terminology to avoid confusion.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The office of the State Attorney General also recommended that the Bureau require a minimum 10-day notice prior to imposition of an inactivity fee on a payroll card account. The commenter stated that the notice should include the amount of the inactivity fee, the date the fee will be assessed, and a description of how to avoid the fee. The commenter asserted that the notice should be provided through the employee's preferred method of receiving communications from the payroll card account vendor.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">7</em>) and comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">7</em>)-1, renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(2)(vii) and comment 18(b)(2)(vii)-1, with certain modifications as described below. Because some consumers use prepaid cards on an infrequent or occasional basis, the Bureau continues to believe that disclosure of the inactivity fee is important to provide specific information to consumers regarding the consequences of their prepaid account use patterns, even though not all financial institutions may charge this fee. The Bureau understands the concerns of those commenters seeking to have the fee removed from the short form, but believes that other means of communicating this potentially significant fee are insufficient.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In the final rule, in place of the proposed disclosure of the “duration of inactivity,” the Bureau is requiring the broader disclosure of the “conditions” that trigger the financial institution to impose the inactivity fee.<footnote ref="396">Of course, if there is no inactivity fee, no disclosure of conditions is required.</footnote>
             This change is intended to ensure that more relevant information is disclosed, including what the consumer must do to avoid imposition of the inactivity fee (such as engaging in at least one transaction during a specified time period), the time period after which the fee is imposed, and how often the fee is assessed. The Bureau has made corresponding changes to comment 18(b)(2)(vii)-1, and also removed the direction to financial institutions to specify in the long form whether the inactivity fee is imposed in lieu of or in addition to the periodic fee, having relocated this portion of the comment to final comment 18(b)(4)(ii)-2, which addresses disclosure in the long form of any conditions under which a fee may be imposed, waived, or reduced. Final comment 18(b)(2)(vii)-1 also contains an illustrative example of an inactivity fee disclosure. Finally, the Bureau made other technical modifications to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(vii) and comment 18(b)(2)(vii)-1 for conformity and clarity.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In response to the comment from a consumer group that proposed comment 18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">7</em>)-1 implicitly endorses the simultaneous charge of both a periodic fee and an inactivity fee, the Bureau reiterates that it does not endorse such a practice nor is it aware of any financial institution that imposes both fees at the same time. However, the Bureau believes it is important that consumers be clearly apprised if their prepaid account charges a periodic fee and an inactivity fee in tandem and for this reason it is included in the commentary for the final rule's long form disclosure requirements. In response to the consumer group recommending that the Bureau require standardized terminology for the inactivity fee disclosure to avoid consumer confusion, because the final rule requires financial institutions to make this disclosure using the term “inactivity fee” or a substantially similar term, the Bureau expects that financial institutions will not use substantially different terminology that would confuse consumers. The Bureau also notes that final § 1005.18(b)(8), discussed below, requires financial institutions to use fee names and other terms consistently within and across the short form and long form disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Regarding the comment requesting that the Bureau ban inactivity fees either generally or for payroll card accounts, such a request is outside the scope of this rulemaking.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>31(b)(2)(v) Contact Information of the Provider</title>
      <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(ii)(II) generally requires that the remittance transfer provider disclose appropriate contact information for the remittance transfer provider, its State regulator, and the Bureau. The Board stated that appropriate contact information includes the name, telephone number, and Web site of these entities, so that senders would have multiple options for addressing any issues that may arise with respect to a remittance transfer provider. Proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(v) provided for the disclosure of the name, telephone number, and Web site of the remittance transfer provider. The Bureau did not receive comment on proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(v), and the Bureau is finalizing it substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(b)(2)(v). The final rule adds language to allow providers to disclose more than one telephone number to account for circumstances, for example, where a provider maintains a separate TTY/TDD telephone number.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>33(a)(1)(iii) Incorrect Amount Received by the Designated Recipient</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iii) to provide that an “error” generally included the failure by a remittance transfer provider to make available to a designated recipient the amount of currency identified in the receipt or combined disclosure given to the sender, unless the disclosure provided an estimate made in accordance with proposed § 205.32 (adopted as § 1005.32 above). The Board also proposed guidance in comment 33(a)-2 regarding the scope of the error under proposed § 205.33(a)(1)(iii). Furthermore, proposed comment 33(a)-3 provided examples illustrating circumstances in which an incorrect amount of currency may be received by a designated recipient.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter recommended that the exclusion of estimated disclosures made pursuant to § 1005.32 from the definition of “error” under renumbered § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) should be applied to other errors listed in § 1005.33(a)(1). The Bureau notes, however, that none of the other errors in § 1005.33(a)(1) rely on the difference between what may be disclosed as an estimate and the actual amount. For example, suppose a remittance transfer is permitted to estimate disclosures under § 1005.32. If the remittance transfer provider fails to deliver any funds to the designated recipient, the sender should be able to assert an error even though the provider disclosed an estimate. As a result, the Bureau declines to make the requested change, and the exclusion of estimated disclosures made pursuant to § 1005.32 is adopted as renumbered § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii)(A).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau has added language to clarify that the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii)(A) from the definition of “error” applies if the difference results from application of the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes, rather than any estimated amounts. This clarification prevents a remittance transfer provider from relying on the exception for estimates if it makes available to the designated recipient an amount that is completely unrelated to the amount calculated using the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes. For example, if the remittance transfer provider estimated the amount to be received pursuant to § 1005.32 as 1,200 pesos in the receipt or combined disclosure, and the amount calculated using the applicable actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes is 1,150 pesos, the provider cannot use the § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii)(A) exception to claim that there is no error if it made only 100 pesos available to the designated recipient.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail below, several industry commenters requested expansion of the exception to the error defined in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) for extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated. The Bureau believes that it is appropriate to provide this exception for an error involving an incorrect amount received by the designated recipient. For example, suppose a foreign government in the country where a remittance transfer is to be delivered imposes an emergency tax on the transfer that was not in effect nor could have been reasonably anticipated at the time the provider was required to give the sender the receipt or combined disclosure. The failure to make available to the designated recipient the amount of currency identified in the receipt or combined disclosure given to the sender, which did not reflect the emergency tax, should not constitute an error if the designated recipient received the disclosed amount of currency less the emergency tax.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As a result, new § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii)(B) provides that the failure to make the amount of currency stated in the receipt or combined disclosure is not an error if the failure resulted from extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated. Furthermore, the Bureau adopts new comment 33(a)-4 to provide guidance on what types of extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated qualify for the exception. The comment is similar to the comment adopted as comment 33(a)-6 below, which describes extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated for purposes of the error for failure to make funds available by the disclosed date of availability in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 33(a)-2 is adopted with a change to clarify that if a provider rounds the exchange rate used to calculate the amount received consistent with § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) and comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-2 for the disclosed rate, there is no error if the designated recipient receives an amount of currency that results from applying the exchange rate used, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate, to calculate fees, taxes, and the amount received rather than the disclosed rate. The change is intended to be consistent with the Bureau's general approach to rounding exchange rates as described above in the supplementary information to comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-2. Proposed comment 33(a)-3 is adopted substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>33(a)(1)(iii) Incorrect Amount Received by the Designated Recipient</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.33(a)(1)(iii), as adopted in the 2012 Final Rule, defines as an error the failure to make available to a designated recipient the amount of currency stated in the disclosure provided to the sender under § 1005.31(b)(2) or (3) for the remittance transfer.  The commentary to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) explains that this category includes situations in which the designated recipient may receive an incorrect amount of currency. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 33(a)-2.  Insofar as the Bureau is amending § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) to exclude from the disclosed total to be received by the designated recipient non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, the Bureau has adjusted the definition of error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) to reflect that change.  Thus, as adopted in the 2013 Final Rule, § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) states that an error includes the failure to make available to a designated recipient the amount of currency disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) and stated in the disclosure provided to the sender under § 1005.31(b)(2) or (3) for the remittance transfer.  Relatedly, the Bureau is adding a new exception, in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii)(C), which states that no error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) occurs if the difference results from the application of non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider and the provider provided the disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii).  The Bureau is also making conforming edits to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii)(A) and (B) to allow for the addition of § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii)(C). </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also making conforming edits to the related commentary.  In the 2013 Final Rule, the examples in comment 33(a)-3.ii are revised to reflect the changes discussed above regarding the disclosure of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the provider.  Comment 33(a)-3.ii, as revised, discusses as an example a situation in which the remittance transfer provider provides the sender a receipt stating an amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient, which does not reflect the additional foreign taxes that will be collected in Colombia on the transfer but includes the disclaimer required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii).  The comment explains that because the designated recipient will receive less than the amount of currency disclosed on the receipt due solely to the additional foreign taxes that the provider was not required to disclose, no error has occurred.  Comment 33(a)-3.iii, as revised, addresses a situation where the receipt provided by the remittance transfer provider does not reflect additional fees that are imposed by the receiving agent in Colombia on the transfer.  Because the designated recipient in this example will receive less than the amount of currency disclosed in the receipt due to the additional covered third-party fees, an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) has occurred. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adding new comment 33(a)-3.vi, which provides an example of a situation where a sender requests that his bank send US$120 to a designated recipient's account at an institution in a foreign country.  The foreign institution is not an agent of the provider.  Only US$100 is deposited into the designated recipient's account because the recipient institution imposed a US$20 incoming wire fee and deducted the fee from the amount deposited into the designated recipient's account.  Because this fee is a non-covered third-party fee that the remittance transfer provider is not required to disclose under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), no error has occurred if the provider provided the disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Separately, in the December Proposal, the Bureau proposed to make technical corrections to comment 33(a)-4, which, as published in the <em data-original="E-04">Federal Register</em> as part of the February Final Rule had improperly cited to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(B) rather than to § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii)(B) and thus improperly described the relevant exception.  The Bureau received no comments on this proposed correction, and it is adopted as proposed with a change to reflect the revisions discussed above to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii). </analysisParagraph>

      <title>31(b)(2)(iv) Rights of Sender</title>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail below regarding §§ 1005.33 and 1005.34, EFTA section 919(d) provides the sender with substantive error resolution and cancellation rights. EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(ii)(I) requires a remittance transfer provider to provide a statement containing information about the rights of the sender regarding the resolution of errors on the receipt or combined disclosure. EFTA section 919(d)(3) requires the Bureau to issue final rules regarding appropriate cancellation and refund policies for senders. The Board stated its belief that providing a lengthy disclosure to the sender each time the sender makes a remittance transfer could be ineffective at conveying the most important information that a sender would need to resolve an error or cancel a transaction. However, the Board also stated that a sender should have access to a complete description of the sender's error resolution and cancellation rights in order to effectively exercise those rights. As a result, the Board proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(iv) in conjunction with a long form error resolution notice in proposed § 205.31(b)(4). The two disclosures were intended to balance the interest in providing a sender a concise disclosure with the sender's ability to obtain a full explanation of those rights.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(iv) stated that a remittance transfer provider must disclose to a sender an abbreviated statement about the sender's error resolution and cancellation rights using language set forth in Model Form A-37 of Appendix A or substantially similar language. The proposed statement included a brief disclosure of the sender's error resolution and cancellation rights, as well as a notification that a sender may contact the remittance transfer provider for a written explanation of these rights.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters argued that the abbreviated disclosure in proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(iv) should provide more comprehensive information to a sender. These commenters also suggested that the abbreviated disclosure would not comply with the statute. One of the consumer group commenters stated that all of the senders' rights should be disclosed on the receipt, instead of a shorter disclosure, because senders of remittance transfers may be less educated or less likely to have access to phone and internet compared to other consumers.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees that education of senders about the consumer protections created by EFTA section 919 is an important statutory and policy goal. However, the Bureau believes EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(ii)(I) does not require a remittance transfer provider to enumerate a sender's error resolution rights. Rather, the statute requires the provider to disclose information about the rights of the sender under EFTA section 919 regarding the resolution of errors, and the Bureau believes the proposed language satisfies this requirement. Moreover, consumer testing participants understood and responded positively to the concise, abbreviated disclosure and favorably compared the statement against current error resolution disclosures with which they had experience and which they noted could be long and in “fine print.” Thus, the Bureau is finalizing the abbreviated disclosure requirement in renumbered § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv). <em data-original="E-03">See also</em> § 1005.31(b)(4), below. The Bureau, however, is amending the language in the abbreviated statement about senders' error resolution rights on Model Form A-37 to include a more explicit statement informing senders that they have such rights. The Bureau is also adding a requirement in § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) to account for the alternative cancellation requirements in § 1005.36(c) for remittance transfers scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, as discussed below. Section 1005.31(b)(2)(iv), therefore, also provides that for any remittance transfer scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, the statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation must instead reflect the requirements of § 1005.36(c).</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters voiced concern regarding the interplay between the short form disclosure required for payroll card accounts (and government benefit accounts) and disclosure of information required by State law and other fee discounts and waivers for these products.<footnote ref="443">See, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(2)(iii) above regarding ATM withdrawal fees.</footnote>
             In response to these concerns, the Bureau is adopting new § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B) which states that, for payroll card accounts, a financial institution may, but is not required to, include a statement in one additional line of text directing the consumer to a particular location outside the short form disclosure for information on ways the consumer may access payroll card account funds and balance information for free or for a reduced fee. This statement must be located directly below any statements disclosed pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(3)(i) and (ii) (regarding variable fees), or, if no such statements are disclosed, above the statement required by final § 1005.18(b)(2)(x) (regarding overdraft credit features). In addition, for the reasons set forth below, the Bureau is adopting new comment 18(b)(2)(xiv)(B)-1. The Bureau is also adopting a similar provision for government benefit accounts in final § 1005.15(c)(2)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that some commenters may have misunderstood the proposed short form disclosure as prohibiting inclusion <em data-original="E-03">near</em> the short form disclosure of State-required information regarding the payroll card account (or government benefit account), particularly State-mandated methods to access the full amount of wages for free each pay period. However, neither the proposed rule nor this final rule's segregation requirements prohibit such disclosures near, but outside, of the short form. Final § 1005.18(b)(7)(iii), as discussed in detail below, provides that the short form and long form disclosures must be segregated from other information and must contain only information that is required or permitted for those disclosures by final § 1005.18(b). Thus, while additional information may not be added to the short form, there is no prohibition in the proposed or final rule against including other information, such as the State-required disclosures or other fee discounts and waivers, on the same page as the short form. Moreover, because payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts are not subject to the same space constraints as prepaid accounts sold in retail locations, the short form disclosure for such accounts likely can accommodate additional information on the same page as the short form disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau examined the potential feasibility of the optional statement in final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B) during its post-proposal consumer testing. Specifically, testing was conducted to ascertain whether consumers understood the relationship between specific information provided on the same page as (but outside) the short form to the information inside the short form.<footnote ref="444">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report II at apps. B and C for the forms shown to participants during the Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing. The tested information included: First three out-of-network ATM withdrawals per month free; one free bank teller cash withdrawal per month; and balance information available for free online, via mobile app, and by calling automated customer service.</footnote>
             The discounts/waivers listed below the short form were generally related to a fee that was asterisked in the prototype short form to indicate the fee can be lower.<footnote ref="445">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt; The tested information included: first three out-of-network ATM withdrawals per month free; one free bank teller cash withdrawal per month; and balance information available for free online, via mobile app, and by calling automated customer service.</footnote>
             To help direct participants' attention to these additional disclosures, the short form included the following statement below the asterisk statement: “See below for free ways to access your funds and balance information.” In addition, in one round of testing, participants were provided with both a prototype short form and a long form to see if they could locate information about specific fees that were not included within the short form. In post-proposal consumer testing, the majority of participants understood and could use this information.<footnote ref="446">In the first round of post-proposal testing, four of nine participants understood how the information in the short form disclosure related to the additional disclosures appearing below the short form. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt; at 17. The Bureau believes more participants would have made the link to this information if the prototype payroll card account short form had not been tested last; the Bureau believes participants stopped reading the content of the asterisk disclosure because they assumed they already knew what it said from the previous versions they had reviewed. In the second round, all 11 participants were able to use the information below the short form or the information in the long form to correctly respond to queries as to whether certain fees could be lower than the fees cited within the short form. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt; at 28-29. In the second round of the Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing, the prototype government benefit short form was the first form shown to participants. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Id.&lt;/em&gt; at 20-21.</footnote>
             Based on this testing, the Bureau believes that consumers will be able to understand the connection between information in the short form and other information that financial institutions may include on the same page as, but outside, the short form disclosure. The Bureau believes that permitting such a statement in the short form for payroll card accounts (and government benefit accounts) will not disrupt consumer engagement and comprehension and would help industry accommodate for any potential discrepancies between Federal and State disclosure requirements.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 18(b)(2)(xiv)(B)-1 provides several examples of how a financial institution might disclose in the short form for payroll card accounts a statement directing consumers to outside the short form to find information on conditions for a consumer to access funds and balance information for free or for a reduced fee in accordance with § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B). Specifically, the comment states that, for example, a financial institution might include the following line of text in the short form disclosure: “See below for free ways to access your funds and balance information” and then list below, but on the same page as, the short form disclosure several ways consumers can access their payroll card account funds and balance information for free. Alternatively, the financial institution might direct the consumer to another location for that information, such as by stating “See the cardholder agreement for free ways to access your funds and balance information.” The comment also notes that a similar statement is permitted for government benefit accounts pursuant to final § 1005.15(c)(2)(ii).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>4(a)(1) Form of Disclosures</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1005.4(a)(1) sets forth general requirements for disclosures required by Regulation E. Among other things, it provides that the disclosures must be clear and readily understandable. Existing comment 4(a)-1 explains that there are no particular rules governing type size, number of pages, or the relative conspicuousness of various terms in the disclosures. As discussed in greater detail below, the short form and long form disclosures under final § 1005.18(b) are subject to the specific formatting requirements, including prominence and size requirements, that are set forth in final § 1005.18(b)(7). Similarly, remittance transfers subject to subpart B of Regulation E are also subject to specific formatting requirements set forth in existing § 1005.31(c). Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting a conforming change to comment 4(a)-1 to clarify that §§ 1005.18(b)(7) and 1005.31(c) are exceptions to this general principle explained in comment 4(a)-1.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>31(e) Timing</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(e) set forth the timing requirements for the disclosures required by proposed § 205.31.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>31(e)(1) Timing of Pre-Payment and Combined Disclosures</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(e)(1) provided that a pre-payment disclosure required by § 205.31(b)(1) or a combined disclosure provided under § 205.31(b)(3) must be provided to the sender when the sender requests the remittance transfer, but prior to payment for the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters strongly supported requiring these disclosures to be provided before payment, stating that providing pre-payment disclosures was a centerpiece of the statute. One consumer group commenter stated that pre-payment disclosures were necessary to facilitate shopping.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters, however, opposed the requirement to provide disclosures before payment. One industry trade association commenter argued that the disclosure would provide negligible benefits, citing the fact that some participants in the Board's consumer testing stated that they did not want a disclosure prior to payment. One industry commenter suggested that the pre-payment disclosures would confuse or irritate customers who would not understand why disclosure was being provided at that time. Another industry commenter stated that the pre-payment disclosures created needless compliance costs, which would be passed on to senders. As discussed above, some industry commenters urged that if pre-payment disclosures were required, that they be permitted to be disclosed orally or on a screen, even when the transaction is conducted in person, to reduce compliance costs and delays for the sender.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A few industry commenters argued that the combined disclosure should be permitted to be provided after payment is made. One industry commenter noted that EFTA section 919(a)(5)(C) only requires combined disclosure to be accurate at the time payment is made. This commenter stated that providing a document similar to a receipt prior to payment is not possible because such a disclosure could not provide accurate information regarding the date and time of the transaction, the amount paid, and the transaction number, which are elements that help establish proof of payment. Therefore, this commenter argued that the rule should permit the combined disclosure to be provided after payment, if a pre-payment disclosure is provided orally or on a screen at the point-of-sale. This commenter maintained that allowing oral or electronic disclosures would be appropriate in the context of EFTA section 919(a)(5) authority to permit combined disclosures and in light of the Bureau's duty to consider the final rule's costs and benefits. At minimum, this commenter believed the Bureau should permit this method of disclosure for senders who have used the provider's service in the past.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Another industry commenter stated that it currently only had the capability of providing information to senders on a register receipt after payment. This commenter believed that requiring a combined disclosure to be provided prior to payment would require printing a pre-payment disclosure in the middle of a sales transaction.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau recognizes the operational challenges associated with providing pre-payment and particularly combined disclosures to senders prior to payment. However, although current practice generally is to provide written disclosures after payment is made, the statute clearly requires certain disclosures to be provided prior to payment and other disclosures to be provided when payment is made for the remittance transfer. The Bureau also believes that the statute precludes combined disclosures from being provided to senders after payment or in a non-written format. EFTA section 919(a)(5)(C) affirmatively requires that the combined disclosure be <em data-original="E-03">accurate at the time at which payment is made</em> (emphasis added). Such a requirement would be superfluous if the combined disclosure could be provided after payment because a disclosure provided after payment must accurately reflect the terms of the completed transaction pursuant to EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B). Accordingly, the Bureau believes the statute requires both the pre-payment disclosure and the combined disclosure be given prior to payment.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed below in § 1005.36, special timing rules have been adopted for preauthorized remittance transfers to account for the particular challenges associated with providing disclosures for transfers that may occur far in the future. Therefore, proposed § 205.31(e)(1) is adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(e)(1), with modifications to reference new § 1005.36. Section 1005.31(e)(1) states that except as provided in § 1005.36(a), a pre-payment disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(1) or a combined disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(3) must be provided to the sender when the sender requests the remittance transfer, but prior to payment for the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(e)-1 clarified when a sender has requested a remittance transfer, for purposes of determining when a pre-payment or combined disclosure must be provided. The proposed comment is adopted substantially as proposed, with a reference to the provisions for preauthorized remittance transfers in new § 1005.36. Comment 31(e)-1 states that, except as provided in § 1005.36(a), pre-payment and combined disclosures are required to be provided to the sender when the sender requests the remittance transfer, but prior to payment for the transfer. The comment clarifies that whether a consumer has requested a remittance transfer depends on the facts and circumstances. A sender that asks a provider to send a remittance transfer, and that provides transaction-specific information to the provider in order to send funds to a designated recipient, has requested a remittance transfer. For example, a sender who asks the provider to send money to a recipient in Mexico and provides the sender and recipient information to the provider has requested the remittance transfer provider to send a remittance transfer. In contrast, a consumer who solely inquires about that day's rates and fees to send to Mexico has not requested the remittance transfer provider to send a remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>31(e)(2) Timing of Receipts</title>
        <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B) requires that a receipt be provided to a sender at the time the sender makes payment in connection with the remittance transfer. Proposed § 205.31(e)(2) provided that a receipt must be provided to the sender when payment is made for the transaction. The Bureau did not receive comment on this proposed provision. Under the final rule, a receipt required to be provided by § 1005.31(b)(2) generally must be provided to the sender when payment is made for the remittance transfer, except for preauthorized remittance transfers as provided in § 1005.36(a). The Bureau notes that the final rule does not require the receipt to be provided at an exact moment when the sender, for example, hands cash or a credit card to an agent to pay for the transfer. Rather, the Bureau believes that payment for a remittance transfer is a process that may involve several steps. For example, payment for a transfer by credit card could involve a sender handing a credit card to an agent, the agent asking the sender for identification, the agent sending the credit card authorization request, the card authorization being approved, the agent requesting signature on a credit card receipt, and the sender signing the credit card receipt.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(e)-2 provided examples of when a remittance transfer provider may provide the sender a receipt. The Bureau did not receive comment on the proposed comment, which is adopted substantially as proposed. Comment 31(e)-2 in the final rule, however, adds a reference to the special timing rules for preauthorized remittance transfers in § 1005.36. The comment also adds a clarification regarding when a payment is made for purposes of the final rule, including an example stating that, for purposes of subpart B, payment is made when a sender authorizes a payment. The Bureau believes that, for purposes of subpart B, payment is made when a sender authorizes payment because a receipt will be most useful to a sender at that time. Otherwise, if payment is considered to be made when the funds actually leave the sender's account due to delays in processing a payment, a receipt may not be provided to a sender for a day or more. Furthermore, it is not clear how a sender's cancellation right would operate in this scenario. For example, because a sender does not know when funds leave an account, a sender would be unable to know when the cancellation right would be triggered.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(e)-2 in the final rule states that except as provided in § 1005.36(a), a receipt required by § 1005.31(b)(2) must be provided to the sender when payment is made for the remittance transfer. For example, a remittance transfer provider could give the sender the disclosures after the sender pays for the remittance transfer in person, but before the sender leaves the counter. A provider could also give the sender the disclosures immediately before the sender pays for the transaction. For purposes of subpart B, payment is made, for example, when a sender provides cash to the remittance transfer provider or when payment is authorized.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(e)(2) further stated that if a transaction is conducted entirely by telephone, a written receipt may be mailed or delivered to the sender no later than one business day after the date on which payment is made for the remittance transfer. If a transaction is conducted entirely by telephone and involves the transfer of funds from the sender's account held by the provider, the written receipt may be provided on or with the next regularly scheduled periodic statement. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> EFTA section 919(a)(5)(B). In some circumstances, a provider conducting such a transfer from the sender's account held by the provider is not required to provide a periodic statement under other laws. The Board believed that in such circumstances, it would be appropriate to permit the provider to provide a written receipt within a similar period of time as a periodic statement. Therefore, pursuant to EFTA section 904(c), the Board also proposed in § 205.31(e)(2) that the written receipt may be provided within 30 days after payment is made for the remittance transfer if a periodic statement is not required. Under the proposal, in order for the written receipt to be mailed or delivered to a sender conducting a transaction entirely by telephone at these later times, the remittance transfer provider was required to comply with the foreign language requirements of proposed § 205.31(g)(3).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter argued that the Bureau should include a timing exception in circumstances where a receipt is required to be provided to a sender shortly before a periodic statement is produced. This commenter stated that a remittance transfer provider may not be able to provide the required disclosures to a sender for a remittance transfer that occurs at the end of a billing cycle in time to include in the statement. The commenter suggested that in such circumstances, the Bureau should permit the receipt to be provided by the later of the next periodic statement date or 30 days after payment. The Bureau believes the final rule gives providers sufficient time to provide a receipt to a sender after a remittance transfer is sent; thus, no accommodation for transfers made at the end of a billing cycle is included in § 1005.31(e)(2). Because periodic statements must include certain information that occurs during a cycle, <em data-original="E-03">see</em> § 1005.9(b), the Bureau expects that, for purposes unrelated to this rule, providers already delay sending a periodic statement for a short time after a cycle ends to ensure that all activity occurring within a cycle is included in the appropriate statement.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and to facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA section 904(a) and (c) to adopt the provisions regarding mailing a receipt in proposed § 205.31(e)(2) as § 1005.31(e)(2) with revisions. Section 1005.31(e)(2) in the final rule eliminates the requirement to comply with proposed § 205.31(g)(3), because the provision has been eliminated in the final rule, as discussed in further detail below. Section 1005.31(e)(2) is also revised to state that if a transaction is conducted entirely by telephone and involves the transfer of funds from the sender's account held by the provider, the receipt may be provided within 30 days after payment is made for the remittance transfer if a periodic statement is not <em data-original="E-03">provided,</em> rather than if a periodic statement is not required. In some circumstances, a provider may provide a sender with a periodic statement even if one is not required to be provided. In these circumstances, the Bureau believes a provider should instead disclose the receipt on or with the periodic statement and that the provision allowing a provider to give a receipt 30 days after payment is made should not apply.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(e)(2) is further revised to account for circumstances in which a provider discloses the statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv), in order to use the telephone exceptions pursuant to § 1005.31(a)(3)(iii) or (a)(5)(iii). In those circumstances, the Bureau does not believe a provider should be required to repeat the statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation on a receipt when it has already been disclosed to the sender. Thus, pursuant to the Bureau's authority under EFTA section 919(d)(3), § 1005.31(e)(2) states that the statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) may, but need not, be disclosed pursuant to the timing requirements of § 1005.31(e)(2) if a provider discloses this information pursuant to § 1005.31(a)(3)(iii) or (a)(5)(iii). The Bureau also adds comment 31(e)(2)-5 to clarify that even though the statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation need not be disclosed pursuant to the timing requirements of § 1005.31(e)(2), the statement about the rights of the sender regarding error resolution required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) must be disclosed pursuant to the timing requirements of § 1005.31(e)(2).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(e)-3 provided further clarification regarding circumstances where a sender transfers funds from his or her account, as defined by § 205.2(b) (currently § 1005.2(b)), that is held by the remittance transfer provider. The Bureau did not receive comment on proposed comment 31(e)-3, which is adopted substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is providing further guidance in the final rule regarding the timing of receipts for remittance transfers made via mobile application or text message. As discussed above, because remittance transfers sent via mobile application or text message are conducted entirely by mobile telephone, the Bureau believes that EFTA section 919(a)(5)(A) permits pre-payment disclosures to be provided orally for such transfers. Similarly, the Bureau believes that that EFTA section 919(a)(5)(B) permits receipts for transfers sent entirely by telephone via mobile application or text message to be provided in accordance with the mailing rules provided for transactions conducted entirely by telephone in § 1005.31(e)(2) or § 1005.36(a). Therefore, the final rule adds a new comment 31(e)-4 to clarify that if a transaction is conducted entirely by telephone via mobile application or text message, a receipt required by § 1005.31(b)(2) may be mailed or delivered to the sender pursuant to the timing requirements in § 1005.31(e)(2) or § 1005.36(a). For example, if a sender conducts a transfer entirely by telephone via mobile application, a remittance transfer provider may mail or deliver the disclosures to a sender pursuant to the timing requirements in § 1005.31(e)(2) or § 1005.36(a).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, several industry commenters requested that the Bureau specifically permit remittance transfer providers to provide receipts for transactions conducted via mobile application or text message by email or through a provider's Web site. The Bureau notes that written receipts provided in accordance with § 1005.31(e)(2) or § 1005.36(a) may be provided electronically, subject to compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 31(a)(2)-1.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>31(d) Estimates</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(d) provided that estimated disclosures may be provided to the extent permitted by proposed § 205.32. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> proposed § 205.32, adopted as § 1005.32, below. The proposed rule provided that such disclosures must be described as estimates, using the term “Estimated,” or a substantially similar term, in close proximity to the estimated term or terms described. As discussed in the proposal, consumer testing participants generally understood that where the term “estimated” was used in close proximity to the estimated term or terms, the actual amount could vary (for example, the amount of currency to be received could be higher or lower than the amount disclosed). Proposed comment 31(d)-1 provided examples of terms that may be used to indicate that a disclosed amount is estimated. For instance, a remittance transfer provider could describe an estimated disclosure as “Estimated Transfer Amount,” “Other Estimated Fees and Taxes,” or “Total to Recipient (Est.).” A Member of Congress and consumer group commenters agreed that the Bureau should require disclosures to be labeled as estimates when estimates are used. Therefore, proposed § 205.31(d) and proposed comment 31(d)-1 are adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(d) and comment 31(d)-1.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>31(g) Foreign Language Disclosures</title>
      <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(b) provides that disclosures required under EFTA section 919 must be made in English and in each of the foreign languages principally used by the remittance transfer provider, or any of its agents, to advertise, solicit, or market, either orally or in writing, at that office. The Board proposed § 205.31(g)(1) to implement EFTA section 919(b) for written or electronic disclosures generally, with some modifications as discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule. In addition, the Board proposed § 205.31(g)(2) and (3) to exempt from the general foreign language disclosure requirements oral disclosures and written receipts for telephone transactions. The Bureau is adopting § 205.31(g) in renumbered § 1005.31(g) generally as proposed with some changes in response to suggestions from commenters, as discussed in detail below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>31(g)(1) General</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(g)(1) provided that disclosures required under subpart B, other than oral disclosures and written receipts for telephone transactions, must be made in English and in each of the foreign languages principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfer services, either orally, in writing, or electronically, at that office. Alternatively, proposed § 205.31(g)(1) provided that these disclosures may be made in English, and, if applicable, in the foreign language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction (or for written or electronic disclosures made pursuant to proposed § 205.33, in the foreign language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to assert the error), provided that such foreign language is principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfer services, either orally, in writing, or electronically, at that office.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, proposed § 205.31(g)(1) contained certain exceptions and clarifications to the requirements of EFTA section 919(b). Specifically, the Board proposed: (i) To apply the provisions only to written or electronic disclosures and address oral disclosures separately in proposed § 205.31(g)(2); (ii) to simplify the statutory language in EFTA section 919(b) by removing the term “or its agents;” (iii) to include electronic advertising, soliciting or marketing as a trigger to the foreign language disclosure requirements, in addition to oral and written advertisements, solicitations, or marketing; (iv) to limit the trigger to foreign language advertisements, solicitations, or marketing of remittance transfer services, and to exclude from the trigger foreign language advertisements, solicitations, or marketing of other products or services; and (v) to permit, under its EFTA section 904(c) authority, a remittance transfer provider to fulfill its obligations by providing the sender with disclosures in English and, if applicable, the one triggered foreign language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction or assert an error in lieu of providing disclosures in each of the triggered foreign languages.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Commenters did not object to these specific proposed modifications. However, several industry commenters stated that the foreign language disclosure requirements generally would provide a disincentive for remittance transfer providers to provide a wide range of foreign language services to customers. Some of these commenters suggested that if remittance transfer providers were to offer fewer foreign language services, this would drive some customers to use illicit operators who provide the foreign-language services discontinued by legitimate remittance transfer providers. Another commenter suggested that the disclosures should only be provided in English because the foreign language requirement would impose costs that would be passed on to consumers who might not derive any benefit from such services.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters and a member of Congress, however, thought the rule should ensure that non- and limited-English speaking consumers have access to meaningful remittance transfer disclosures. The Congressional commenter also agreed with the Board's proposal to extend the advertising, soliciting, or marketing trigger to electronic advertisements, solicitations, and marketing.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(b) requires disclosures to be provided in certain foreign languages, and the Bureau believes the Board's proposed modifications to the statutory requirements alleviates burden on remittance transfer providers. The Bureau believes that proposed § 205.31(g)(1) reflects a proper balancing of interests in providing non- and limited-English speaking consumers with disclosures in a language with which they are familiar with the burden on remittance transfer providers of providing multilingual disclosures in implementing EFTA section 919(b). The statute and the implementing regulation seek to ensure that if remittance transfer providers make a concerted effort to reach out to potential remittance transfer customers through advertisements, solicitations, and marketing in a foreign language in a particular office, then such providers should also be required to provide important disclosures in that language when such customers come to that office to purchase remittance transfer services from that provider or assert an error.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, the Bureau agrees with the Board's proposed modifications and clarifications to the statutory language for the reasons discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, and commenters did not object to such modifications and clarifications. Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA section 904(a) and (c) to adopt proposed § 205.31(g)(1) in renumbered § 1005.31(g)(1), with the removal of a reference to proposed § 205.31(g)(3) regarding written receipts for telephone transactions, which is further discussed below, and other minor technical and clarifying amendments. Most notably, the Bureau is changing the references to “that office” in the proposed rule to “the office in which a sender conducts a transaction or asserts an error” for clarity.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisSection>
          <title>Principally Used</title>
          <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(g)(1)-1 clarified when a foreign language is principally used. As the Board stated in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the statute indicates that more than one foreign language may be principally used. Consequently, the Board's interpretation of the term “principally used” was not limited to the one foreign language used most frequently by the remittance transfer provider. Instead, proposed comment 31(g)(1)-1 adopted a facts-and-circumstances approach to determining when a foreign language is principally used. Under proposed comment 31(g)(1)-1, factors contributing to whether a foreign language is principally used would include: (i) The frequency with which the remittance transfer provider advertises, solicits, or markets remittance transfers in a foreign language at a particular office; (ii) the prominence of such advertising, soliciting, or marketing in that language at that office; and (iii) the specific foreign language terms used to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfer services at that office. Proposed comment 31(g)(1)-1 also included examples to illustrate when a foreign language is principally used and when there is incidental use of the language. As discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the Board also considered an objective standard based on whether a foreign language meets a certain percentage threshold of a remittance transfer provider's advertisements at a particular office. However, the Board rejected such a standard based on the fact that the standard may be arbitrary, may be difficult to administer, and may inappropriately exclude instances where a foreign language is principally used to advertise, solicit or market remittance transfers, even if the number of advertisements in the foreign language is nominally low.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters suggested that there be further clarification on the term “principally used,” but did not specifically state what kind of guidance would be helpful. A consumer group commenter agreed with the proposed facts-and-circumstances approach for determining foreign languages principally used in advertising, soliciting, or marketing remittance transfer services. A member of Congress agreed with the Board's interpretation that the statutory provision contemplated that more than one foreign language could be principally used.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with the Board's reasoning in proposing comment 31(g)(1)-1. Because the Bureau believes the particular facts and circumstances surrounding the use of a foreign language to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers will determine whether a foreign language is “principally used” to advertise, solicit, or market at a particular office, the Bureau does not believe further general statements would be helpful. However, the Bureau is amending one of the illustrative examples in comment 31(g)(1)-1 to provide a more clear example of when a remittance transfer provider would be considered to be principally using a foreign language to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers at an office.</analysisParagraph>

          <title>Advertise, Solicit, or Market</title>
          <analysisParagraph>Neither the EFTA nor Regulation E defines “advertising,” “soliciting,” or “marketing.” <footnote ref="77">Regulation E contains some guidance on whether a card, code, or other device is “marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate” or “marketed to the general public” for purposes of the requirements pertaining to gift cards. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; comments 20(b)(2)-2, 20(b)(2)-3, and 20(b)(4)-1. However, that guidance focuses on a narrow set of circumstances and does not address more broadly what actions generally constitute advertising, soliciting, or marketing.</footnote>
             However, the general concept of advertising, soliciting, or marketing is explained in other regulations administered by the Bureau. <em data-original="E-03">See, e.g.,</em> Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.2(a)(2) and associated commentary; Regulation DD, 12 CFR 1030.2(b) and 1030.11(b) and associated commentary.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed comment 31(g)(1)-2 to provide positive and negative examples of advertising, soliciting, or marketing in a foreign language. These examples were based on examples from the commentary to other regulations (specifically, renumbered §§ 1026.2(a)(2) and 1030.2(b)) regarding the definition of “advertisement,” as well as examples related to the promotion of overdrafts under § 1030.11(b). Some industry commenters asked whether the terms “market” and “solicit” mean something different than “advertise” and requested definitions for “market” or “solicit” if they are meant to have different meanings. The Bureau believes, that for purposes of subpart B of Regulation E, the terms “advertise,” “solicit” and “market” have the same general meaning, and comment 31(g)(1)-2 is adopted substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
        </analysisSection>
        <analysisSection>
          <title>At the Office</title>
          <analysisParagraph>Under EFTA section 919(b) and proposed § 205.31(g)(1), foreign language disclosures would be required when the foreign language is principally used to advertise, solicit, or market “at that office.” As discussed above, the Bureau is changing the reference in § 1005.31(g)(1) from “that office” to “the office in which a sender conducts a transaction or asserts an error” for clarity in the final rule. The Board proposed comment 31(g)(1)-3 to clarify the meaning of “office.” As discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, proposed 31(g)(1)-3 reflected the Board's belief that an office includes both physical and non-physical locations where remittance transfer services are offered to consumers, including any telephone number or Web site through which a consumer can complete a transaction or assert an error. The Board further noted that a telephone number or Web site that provides general information about the remittance transfer provider, but through which a consumer does not have the ability to complete a transaction or assert an error, is not an office. Proposed comment 31(g)(1)-3 also clarified that a location need not exclusively offer remittance transfer services in order to be considered an office for purposes of § 1005.31(g)(1) (proposed as § 205.31(g)(1)), and included an example to illustrate this point.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters requested clarification on whether a Web site targeted to consumers outside of the United States could be an “office” for purposes of the foreign language disclosure requirements. In response, the Bureau is revising comment 31(g)(1)-3 to clarify that because a consumer must be located in a State to be considered a “sender” under § 1005.30(g), a Web site is not an “office,” even if the Web site can be accessed by consumers that are located in the United States, unless a sender may conduct a remittance transfer on the Web site or may assert an error for a remittance transfer on the Web site. Therefore, a Web site that is targeted to people outside of the United States will not be deemed to be an “office” for purposes of § 1005.31(g) so long as senders cannot conduct a remittance transfer on the Web site or assert an error for a remittance transfer on the Web site.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Board also proposed comment 31(g)(1)-4 to provide guidance on the phrase “at that office.” Proposed comment 31(g)(1)-4 stated that advertisements, solicitations, or marketing posted, provided, or made at a physical office, on a Web site of a remittance transfer provider, or during a telephone call with the remittance transfer provider would constitute advertising, soliciting, or marketing at an office of a remittance transfer provider. The proposed comment also clarified that for error resolution disclosures, the relevant office would be the office in which the sender first asserts the error and not the office where the remittance transfer was conducted.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter requested clarification on a number of situations where the remittance transfer provider may be engaging in general advertising, marketing, or soliciting that is not intended to be made at a particular office, but due to the nature of such advertising, marketing, or soliciting, it happens to occur at a particular office. The Bureau agrees that such a clarification is appropriate and has revised comment 31(g)(1)-4 to state that an advertisement, solicitation, or marketing that is considered to be made at an office does not include general advertisements, solicitations, or marketing that are not intended to be made at a particular office. The proposed comment includes an example to illustrate this concept. Specifically, if an advertisement for remittance transfers in Chinese appears in a Chinese newspaper that is being distributed at a grocery store in which the agent of a remittance transfer provider is located, such advertisement would not be considered to be made at that office.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also amending comment 31(g)(1)-4 to provide that advertisements, soliciting, or marketing posted, provided, or made via mobile application or text message would also be considered advertising, soliciting, or marketing at an office of a remittance transfer provider. The amendment is consistent with the Bureau's other revisions in the final rule clarifying that transfers through mobile application or text message are considered to be transfers conducted by telephone. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(a)(5). The Bureau is also making other minor amendments to comment 31(g)(1)-4 for additional clarity, including changing “that office” to “the office in which a sender conducts a transaction or asserts an error” to be consistent with the change the Bureau is adopting in § 1005.31(g)(1). Based on this change, comment 31(g)(1)-4 also contains a clarification that for disclosures required under § 1005.31, the relevant office would be the office in which the sender conducts the transaction.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>31(g)(2) Oral, Mobile Application or Text Message Disclosures</title>
        <analysisParagraph>In the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the Board proposed to use its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to exempt oral disclosures from the foreign language requirement under EFTA section 919(b). In proposed § 205.31(g)(2), the Board proposed to use its authority under EFTA section 919(a)(5)(A) to permit oral disclosures for transactions conducted entirety by telephone, subject to the requirement that they be made in the language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction. Proposed § 205.31(g)(2) also provided that disclosures permitted to be provided orally under proposed § 205.31(a)(4) for error resolution purposes must be made in the language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to assert the error.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters thought that the rule should not require disclosures in any foreign language that is not principally used to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers. These commenters suggested that such a requirement could hurt consumers by reducing the number of languages that a remittance transfer provider would be willing to use to conduct a transaction.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>However, as the Board explained in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, if a foreign language must be principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers in order to trigger the foreign language requirement for oral disclosures, a sender conducting a transaction or asserting an error in a foreign language on the telephone that did not meet the foreign language advertising trigger may only receive required oral disclosures in English. Consequently, if the remittance transfer provider conducted the actual transaction or communicated with the sender regarding the alleged error in a foreign language, a remittance transfer provider could then switch to English to orally disclose the required information under such a rule. The Bureau believes that senders would benefit from having the required oral disclosures provided in the same language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction or assert the error, regardless of whether the language meets the foreign language advertising trigger. Failure to include this modification from the general foreign language requirement for oral disclosures could lead to consumers not understanding the required disclosures, which would be contrary to the goals and purposes of the statute.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, the Bureau agrees with the Board's reasoning in the May 2011 Proposed Rule that disclosures provided orally under § 1005.31(a)(3) and (4) should be provided only in the language primarily used to conduct the transaction or assert the error. Otherwise, under EFTA section 919(b), a sender conducting a telephone transaction orally or receiving the results of an error investigation orally could be given disclosures in English and in every foreign language triggered by the regulation, which would likely lead to consumer confusion. While the Bureau recognizes that this rule might reduce the languages in which a remittance transfer provider would be willing to conduct a transaction, the Bureau believes that applying the general foreign language disclosure rule to oral disclosures would be harmful to consumers for the reasons set forth above.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Moreover, as discussed above, the Bureau is adopting § 1005.31(a)(5) to permit disclosures to be provided orally or via mobile application or text message for transactions conducted entirely by telephone via mobile application or text message. Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to adopt proposed § 205.31(g)(2) in renumbered § 1005.31(g)(2) with amendments to include a reference to transactions conducted entirely by telephone via mobile application or text message and other minor, non-substantive amendments.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisSection>
          <title>Written Receipt for Telephone Transactions</title>
          <analysisParagraph>The Board also proposed § 205.31(g)(3), which provided that written receipts for transactions conducted entirely by telephone must be made in English and, if applicable, in the foreign language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction, regardless of whether such foreign language is primarily used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers. The Board, however, requested comment on whether the general rule proposed in § 205.31(g)(1) (adopted as § 1005.31(g)(1) above) should apply to the written receipt provided for transactions conducted entirely by telephone. Adopting the general rule proposed in § 205.31(g)(1) for written receipts provided for transactions conducted entirely by telephone would mean that a remittance transfer provider would not be obligated to provide the written receipt in a foreign language, even if such foreign language was used to conduct the telephone transaction, unless the foreign language was principally used to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers during the telephone call.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>As noted above, some industry commenters thought that the rule should not require disclosures in any foreign language that is not principally used to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers because this might cause remittance transfer providers to reduce the number of languages they would be willing to use to conduct a remittance transfer. Another industry commenter stated that in its experience, consumers can understand written English even though they may prefer to conduct a transaction orally in their native language for the fluency, ease, and speed at which the transaction may be conducted when speaking in one's native language.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that applying the general rule under § 1005.31(g)(1) to written receipts provided to senders after payment would not cause the same type of consumer confusion as it would for pre-payment disclosures provided orally in transactions conducted entirely by telephone. Although some senders may not have enough familiarity with English to feel comfortable speaking with the remittance transfer provider in English, the same pressure to comprehend and respond quickly does not exist with written disclosures. Unlike with oral disclosures, senders have sufficient time to review written disclosures and, if necessary, find resources to help understand the disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, the Bureau notes that in the Board's outreach with industry, remittance transfer providers generally stated that providing written disclosures in a foreign language can be more costly and burdensome than providing oral disclosures in a foreign language. The Bureau also notes that a remittance transfer provider may have employees or agents that happen to speak a certain foreign language for which the provider does not have written disclosures. The Bureau would not want providers to discourage such employees or agents from using their foreign language skills to help senders with their remittance transfer transactions in order to avoid having to provide written disclosures in the language spoken by the employee or agent. In order to minimize the potential unintended consequence of having remittance transfer providers reduce the number of foreign languages they may offer for telephone transactions, the Bureau is not adopting proposed § 205.31(g)(3). Therefore, written receipts required to be provided to the sender after payment for transactions conducted entirely by telephone are subject to the general rule under § 1005.31(g)(1).</analysisParagraph>
        </analysisSection>
        <analysisSection>
          <title>General Clarifications</title>
          <analysisParagraph>The Board also proposed additional commentary in the May 2011 Proposed Rule to provide general guidance on issues that affect each of the subsections of proposed § 205.31(g) (adopted as § 1005.31(g)) discussed above. EFTA section 919(b) does not limit the number of languages that may be used on a single disclosure. However, proposed comment 31(g)-1 suggested that a single written or electronic document containing more than three languages is not likely to be helpful to a consumer. Since the proposed commentary was not a strict limit, the Board solicited comment on whether the regulation should strictly limit the number of languages that may be contained in a single written or electronic disclosure. The Board also sought comment on whether three languages is an appropriate suggested limit to the number of languages in a single written or electronic document.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter suggested that the rule cap the number of languages a remittance transfer provider would be required to disclose to three languages. The commenter also stated that requiring English, Spanish, and French would cover the vast majority of the languages used in transfers they send from the United States. This commenter also noted that other regulators that have required foreign language disclosures have typically limited the languages that must be disclosed to either English and Spanish, or a small subset of languages such as Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, and Korean. A consumer group commenter recommended that rather than adopting a ceiling on the number of languages that may appear on a disclosure, the Bureau should create guidelines that ensure disclosures with multiple foreign languages are easy to understand.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe that limiting the foreign languages that may be used by a remittance transfer provider best effectuates the goals of the statute. In the Bureau's view, if a remittance transfer provider principally uses a foreign language to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers at an office, the remittance transfer provider is deliberately reaching out to consumers speaking that foreign language, and the required disclosures should be provided in that foreign language, regardless of whether it is a language that is commonly used for remittance transfers originating in the United States. Furthermore, while too many languages on a single written document may diminish a consumer's ability to read and understand the disclosures, the Bureau believes that remittance transfer providers may find ways to present the information in a number of foreign languages that are clear and conspicuous to senders, and that imposing a definitive limit on the number of languages that may appear on a single disclosure may be too inflexible. Moreover, the Bureau believes that the formatting requirements in § 1005.31(c), as discussed above, may help to ensure that senders can find and understand the information that is most important to them with respect to the remittance transfer. The Bureau is amending comment 31(g)-1 to note that disclosures must be clear and conspicuous pursuant to § 1005.31(a)(1) without suggesting a specific limit on the number of languages in a single disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(g)-1 also clarified that the remittance transfer provider may provide disclosures in a single document with both languages or in two separate documents with one document in English and the other document in the applicable foreign language. The Board also proposed several examples in comment 31(g)-1 to illustrate the application of this concept.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters thought that senders should be able to designate the language in which they prefer to receive disclosures, provided it is a language that is principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers, instead of providing disclosures in both English and the applicable foreign language. The Bureau notes that EFTA section 919(b) requires disclosures to be provided in English and in each of the foreign languages principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market at that office. This means that regardless of which office a sender chooses to conduct a remittance transfer, he or she will always obtain written or electronic disclosures in English, even if the disclosure in a foreign language is not consistent among different offices because such disclosure will depend on whether the foreign language meets the foreign language disclosure trigger at that office. The Bureau believes that always disclosing in English is important to allow senders to compare disclosures received at different provider locations and for different providers. Therefore, the final rule requires remittance transfer providers to provide disclosures in English in all cases. This is fully consistent with EFTA section 919(b). Comment 31(g)-1 is adopted as proposed with some technical and clarifying amendments, including to remove references to § 205.31(g)(3), consistent with the Bureau's decision regarding written receipts for telephone transactions, as discussed above.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Board also proposed comment 31(g)-2 to clarify when a language is primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct a transaction and assert an error. A remittance transfer provider must determine the language that is primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct a transaction or assert an error if the provider chooses to provide written or electronic disclosures in English and the foreign language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction or to assert an error. Furthermore, under § 1005.31(g)(2), a remittance transfer provider is required to provide oral disclosures in the language that is primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction or assert an error.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Specifically, proposed comment 31(g)-2 clarified that the language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction is the primary language used to convey the information necessary to complete the transaction. Proposed comment 31(g)-2 also stated that the language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to assert an error is the primary language used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to provide the information required by § 1005.33(b) to assert an error. The proposed comment also provided examples to clarify this concept.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter suggested that the foreign language disclosure requirement should relate to the language used by the remittance transfer provider, rather than the language used by the sender. Some industry commenters recommended that the Bureau provide further clarification of the term “primarily used” without specifying what type of guidance would be helpful. The Bureau notes that proposed comment 31(g)-2 specifies that the relevant foreign language is the foreign language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct a transaction or assert an error, and the examples show that a foreign language must be used by both the sender and the remittance transfer provider to be primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct a transaction or assert an error. The Bureau believes the proposed commentary is clear on this point. However, as additional clarification, the Bureau is including a new example in comment 31(g)-2 to illustrate when a sender primarily uses a foreign language with a remittance transfer provider in the internet context.</analysisParagraph>
        </analysisSection>
        <analysisSection>
          <title>Storefront and Internet Disclosures</title>
          <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(6)(A) states that the Bureau may prescribe rules to require a remittance transfer provider to prominently post, and timely update, a notice describing a model remittance transfer for one or more amounts. The provision states that such a notice shall show the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient, using the values of the currency into which the funds will be exchanged. EFTA section 919(a)(6)(A) also states that the Bureau may require the notice prescribed to be displayed in every physical storefront location owned or controlled by the remittance transfer provider. Further, EFTA section 919(a)(6)(A) states that the Bureau shall prescribe rules to require a remittance transfer provider that provides remittance transfers via the internet to provide a notice, comparable to the storefront notice described in the statute, located on the home page or landing page (with respect to such remittance transfer services) owned or controlled by the remittance transfer provider.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(6)(B) states that, prior to proposing rules under EFTA section 919(a)(6)(A), appropriate studies and analyses must be performed to determine whether a storefront notice or internet notice facilitates the ability of a consumer to: (i) Compare prices for remittance transfers, and (ii) understand the types and amounts of any fees or costs imposed on remittance transfers. The studies and analyses must be consistent with EFTA section 904(a)(2), which requires an economic impact analysis that considers the costs and benefits of a regulation to financial institutions, consumers, and other users. These costs and benefits include the extent to which additional paperwork would be required, the effects upon competition in the provision of services among large and small financial institutions, and the availability of services to different classes of consumers, particularly low income consumers.<footnote ref="78">As discussed below, the Board performed an analysis in the proposed rule consistent with EFTA section 904(a)(2), as it existed prior to any amendments in the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 904(a)(2), however, did not apply and was not amended by the Dodd-Frank Act to apply to the Bureau. Regardless, the Board's analysis from the proposal is unchanged, and the Bureau concurs with the Board's analysis.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Consistent with EFTA section 919(a)(6)(B), the Board reviewed and analyzed the statute and a variety of independent articles, studies, and Congressional testimony; conducted outreach with industry and consumer advocates; and held focus groups with consumers who send remittance transfers. Based on its findings, summarized below, the Board concluded in the May 2011 Proposed Rule that the statutory notice would not facilitate a consumer's ability to compare prices or to understand the fees and costs imposed on remittance transfers.<footnote ref="79">A complete discussion of the Board's findings is available at 76 FR at 29924-29927.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The notice described by the statute illustrates only the exchange rate offered by that remittance transfer provider for the particular model transfer amount. In addition to the exchange rate, however, the total cost of a remittance transfer includes fees charged by the remittance transfer provider, any intermediary in the transfer, and the receiving entity. The total cost also includes any taxes that may be charged in the sending and receiving jurisdictions. Thus, the Board determined the statutory storefront notice would not present a complete picture to the consumer of all potential fees and costs for a remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>In the proposal, the Board considered two alternatives to the type of notice described in the statute that could more effectively communicate costs to a sender. The Board considered requiring the posting of transfer fee information for model send amounts, but believed that this alternative notice would have many of the same limitations as the statutory notice. The Board also considered requiring a notice that would reflect all the costs of a transfer. A notice with this alternative content could help consumers to obtain a better understanding of the total cost of a remittance transfer, but the length and complexity of such notices could limit their utility.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The analysis conducted by the Board identified other limitations with both the statutory and alternative storefront disclosures. First, most consumers would be unable to apply the information provided by the statutory notice to their own transfers. The fees, exchange rate, and taxes for a remittance transfer can vary based upon the amount sent, transfer corridor (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the sending location to the receiving location), speed of transfer (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> the next day, the same day, or in one hour), method of delivery (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> an electronic deposit into a bank account or a cash disbursement), and type of receiving entity (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> a bank or a money transmitter's payout partner). For example, some remittance transfer providers offer a discount on their exchange rate spread for large send amounts. Therefore, even if the consumer's transfer were identical to the model transfer posted in the storefront notice except for the send amount, the consumer still may be unable to determine the exchange rate that would apply to the consumer's transfer based on the storefront notice.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Moreover, a consumer could be overwhelmed by the amount of data appearing in a long, complex storefront notice posted by these providers and, therefore, might not use it. A storefront notice for sending a specified amount to a single country could contain multiple rows of information to account for differences in pricing based on the transfer method, timing option, receipt location, and cost permutations described above. Many providers offer remittance transfers to multiple countries, and several locations within each country, which would multiply the number of data points on the notice.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Finally, frequent fluctuations in exchange rates could result in disclosures being inaccurate for a period of time. Remittance transfer providers would have to update the storefront notice for each send location several times a week, or as frequently as several times a day, to account for the fluctuations in exchange rates. These rates could also be different at a single provider's different send locations. Remittance transfer providers would need to distribute the updated notices to each send location, and each send location would need to replace the outdated notice just as frequently. Non-exclusive send locations that offer the services of two or more money transmitters would have to post and update the storefront notices for each remittance transfer provider. As a result, a storefront notice could be unhelpful and even misleading to consumers, while creating unnecessary legal risks for remittance transfer providers.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The analysis also identified potential effects that the storefront notice requirement would have on competition and costs to the consumer. The work involved in posting and updating storefront notices could cause some agents to stop offering remittance transfers. Further, credit unions and small banks that infrequently conduct transfers could find the burden and cost of producing storefront notices prohibitive and discontinue the service. Given the costs and risks associated with posting and updating the storefront notices contemplated by the statute, some providers could decide to exit the market, which could reduce competition among providers and increase costs for consumers.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Because the Board did not propose a rule mandating the posting of storefront notices, it did not propose a rule mandating the posting of internet notices. Since the proposal did not require a storefront notice, there could be no “comparable” internet notice. Moreover, the Board's study of model internet notices indicated that consumers using internet remittance transfer providers to request remittance transfers would be less likely to use a model transfer notice than those using providers at a physical location. Many internet providers currently disclose transaction-specific information prior to the consumer's payment for a transfer, and § 1005.31(b)(1), discussed above, makes this practice a regulatory requirement.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters supported the findings that the storefront notice and internet notice would not be useful to consumers. One consumer group commenter believed that the Bureau should require any storefront advertising to be in a storefront disclosure format prescribed by the Bureau. The commenter argued that the storefront disclosure should include the amount a sender pays to a remittance transfer provider and the amount to be received by a recipient for at least two sample amounts. The commenter suggested that disclosures could be based on the cost at a certain time, such as the previous business day, to alleviate the concerns about disclosures needing to be updated more frequently.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees with the Board's analysis, and believes that the storefront and internet disclosures described in EFTA section 919(a)(6)(A) would not accomplish the statutory goals of facilitating the ability of consumers to compare prices for remittance transfers and to understand the types and amounts of any fees or costs imposed on remittance transfers. The disclosures would not provide a complete disclosure of all of the costs of a remittance transfer. Even if all costs were provided in the disclosures, consumers would be unable to extrapolate from a storefront disclosure the cost of their particular transaction, because the cost could depend on other variables. The Bureau also recognizes the burden on remittance transfer providers could be significant and could lead some providers to no longer provide remittance services. The burden on providers would be substantial even if the disclosures were only required to be updated daily. Moreover, requiring less frequent updating would result in the disclosures being inaccurate for a period of time.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Because the cost to providers could be substantial, and the benefit of the storefront and internet disclosures would be minimal, the final rule does not require the posting of model remittance transfer notices at a storefront or on the internet.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>31(f) Accurate When Payment Is Made</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(f) provided that the disclosures required by proposed § 205.31(b) must be accurate when a sender pays for the remittance transfer, except when estimates are permitted by proposed § 205.32. Proposed comment 31(f)-1 clarified that a remittance transfer provider did not have to guarantee the terms of the remittance transfer in the disclosures required by § 205.31(b) for any specific period of time. However, if any of the disclosures required by proposed § 205.31(b) are not accurate when a sender pays for the remittance transfer, a provider would be required to give new disclosures before receiving payment for the remittance transfer. For example, a sender at a retail store may be provided a pre-payment disclosure under proposed § 205.31(b)(1) at a customer service desk, but the sender may decide to leave the desk to go shopping. Upon the sender's return to the customer service desk an hour later, the sender would have to be provided a new pre-payment disclosure if any of the information had changed. However, the sender would not need to be provided a new disclosure if the information had not changed.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters supported the requirement that disclosures must be accurate when payment is made. An industry trade association commenter asked the Bureau to permit remittance transfer providers to include a statement in the disclosures clarifying that changes to the disclosures may occur between the time of payment and the time a transaction clears. However, the Bureau notes that under the proposed rule, only disclosures provided before payment is made would not be guaranteed and thus subject to change. Disclosures provided on receipts generally would be guaranteed, and thus not subject to change, except where estimates are permitted.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(f) is adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(f). The final rule, however, provides that the requirements of § 1005.31(f) and comment 31(f)-1 do not apply to preauthorized remittance transfers, which are subject to separate accuracy requirements in § 1005.36(a).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>31(f) Accurate When Payment Is Made</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(f) of the 2012 Final Rule states that except as provided in § 1005.36(b), disclosures required by this section must be accurate when a sender makes payment for the remittance transfer, except to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32.  In light of the new disclaimer required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii), as well as the optional disclosures under that paragraph, the Bureau is making conforming edits to § 1005.31(f) and comment 31(f)-1 to note that the disclosures required by § 1005.31(b) or permitted by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) must be accurate when a sender makes payment for the remittance transfer, except to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32.  Comment 31(f)-1 further notes that while a remittance transfer provider is not required to guarantee the terms of the remittance transfer in the disclosures required or permitted by § 1005.31(b) for any specific period of time, if any of the disclosures required or permitted by § 1005.31(b) are not accurate when a sender makes payment for the remittance transfer, a provider must give new disclosures before accepting payment.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that extending the accuracy requirement to the optional disclosures regarding non-covered third party fees and taxes collected by persons other than the remittance transfer provider is necessary in order to communicate accurately to the sender how confident the remittance transfer provider is concerning the information provided.  As discussed above, the Bureau believes that such information can be useful to senders under certain circumstances and hopes to encourage use of increasingly reliable information over time.  Although the vast majority of remittance transfer providers may choose to disclose any numbers provided as estimates due to the various uncertainties with regard to foreign taxes and fees discussed above, the Bureau believes it is important to preserve remittance transfer providers' ability to compete based on disclosure of actual figures. </analysisParagraph>

      <title>31(b)(2)(ii) Date Available</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(2) also provided for the disclosure of additional elements on the receipt. EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(i)(II) requires the disclosure of the promised date of delivery to the designated recipient on a receipt. The Board stated its belief that the statute requires disclosure of the date the currency will be available to the designated recipient, not the date the funds are physically picked up by the designated recipient, because the recipient may not pick up the funds for some period of time after the funds are available. Thus, proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(ii) stated that a remittance transfer provider must disclose the date of availability of funds to the designated recipient, using the term “Date Available” or a substantially similar term. Proposed comment 31(b)(2)-1 provided further guidance on this disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In the proposal, the Board recognized that in some instances, it may be difficult to determine the exact date on which a remittance transfer will be available to a designated recipient. For example, an international wire transfer may pass through several intermediary institutions prior to becoming available at the institution of a designated recipient, and the time it takes to pass through these intermediaries may be difficult to determine. As a result, the Board recognized that remittance transfer providers would likely disclose the latest date on which the funds would be available, even if funds are often available sooner. Thus, proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(ii) permitted a provider to include a statement that funds may be available to the designated recipient earlier than the date disclosed, using the term “may be available sooner” or a substantially similar term. The Board had tested various terms in consumer testing for communicating the fact that funds may be available earlier than the date disclosed. Participants generally understood the meaning of the statement that funds “may be available sooner” better than other terms.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters supported the disclosure of the date funds will be available. Many industry commenters argued, however, that it would be difficult or impossible to determine when funds would be made available to a recipient in an open network system, such as where transfers are made to an account at a financial institution with which the provider does not have a correspondent relationship. Industry commenters argued that even if the date of receipt by a recipient financial institution is known, there could be a delay in depositing the funds into a recipient account due to delays at intermediary financial institutions or at the recipient institution. One industry trade association stated that infrastructure deficiencies in some countries may make it impossible to determine the actual date on which funds will be available.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>An industry commenter supported the flexibility provided by the term “may be available sooner,” but stated that dates still may be unpredictable for reasons beyond a provider's control. One industry trade association argued that in order to mitigate compliance risks, some remittance transfer providers will disclose a date well past a reasonable estimate of the date funds will be made available, which would render the disclosure meaningless.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Due to these factors, some industry commenters urged the Bureau to permit an estimated date of availability, including an estimate of the date that funds may be available to a recipient institution, and not the recipient. One commenter suggested that the disclosure could state that a transfer may be delayed by intermediaries or other factors beyond the provider's control.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As stated in the proposal, EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(i)(II) requires disclosure of a single, promised date of delivery of the funds. Neither EFTA section 919(a)(4) nor EFTA section 919(c) permit a remittance transfer provider to provide an estimate of this promised date, despite the fact that the statute permits estimates in other circumstances. Moreover, because the statute requires a remittance transfer provider to provide a disclosure of the promised date of delivery to the designated recipient, the Bureau believes that permitting a provider to disclose the date that funds will be made available to the recipient institution would not comply with the statute.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that by permitting the provider to disclose a date by which funds will certainly be delivered, but also stating that funds “may be available sooner,” a provider can comply with the disclosure requirement. The Bureau recognizes that providers may overestimate the disclosed date on which funds will be available to mitigate compliance risks. However, the Bureau believes that competitive pressures will give providers an incentive to provide as accurate a date as possible.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) is finalized substantially as proposed. Section 1005.31(b)(2)(ii), however, clarifies in the rule, rather than the commentary, as proposed, that a provider must disclose the date in the foreign country on which funds will be available to the designated recipient. This clarification is included to account for instances where time zone differences result in a date in the United States being different from the date in the country of the designated recipient.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The final rule also adopts comment 31(b)(2)-1 substantially as proposed. The comment clarifies that a remittance transfer provider may not provide a range of dates that the remittance transfer may be available, nor an estimate of the date on which funds will be available. If a provider does not know the exact date on which funds will be available, the provider may disclose the latest date on which the funds will be available. For example, if funds may be available on January 3, but are not certain to be available until January 10, then a provider complies with § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) if it discloses January 10 as the date funds will be available. However, a remittance transfer provider may also disclose that funds “may be available sooner” or use a substantially similar term to inform senders that funds may be available to the designated recipient on a date earlier that the date disclosed. For example, the provider may disclose “January 10 (may be available sooner).”</analysisParagraph>

      <title>31(c) Specific Format Requirements</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(c) set forth specific format requirements for the written and electronic disclosures required by this section. Proposed § 205.31(c)(1) and (2) contained grouping and proximity requirements for certain disclosures required under proposed § 205.31. Proposed § 205.31(c)(3) set forth prominence and size requirements for disclosures required by subpart B. Proposed § 205.31(c)(4) contained segregation requirements for disclosures provided under subpart B, with certain specified exceptions.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In the proposal, the Board recognized that the specific formatting requirements set forth in proposed § 205.31(c) were more prescriptive than other disclosures required under Regulation E. The Board requested comment on whether certain requirements in proposed § 205.31(c) could be less prescriptive, while still ensuring that senders are provided with clear and conspicuous disclosures. The Board also solicited comment on how the formatting requirements in proposed § 205.31 could be applied to transactions conducted via mobile application or text message.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received comments regarding each of the proposed format requirements, which are discussed in turn below. Additionally, one industry commenter suggested that the formatting requirements in the final rule should accommodate State law disclosures. The Bureau believes it is appropriate to establish formatting requirements tailored to the elements required to be disclosed under the statute. Providers can separately comply with each State's formatting requirements, to the extent that they meet or exceed the requirements set forth in the final rule. The Bureau believes that the proposed formatting requirements will ensure that disclosures are clear and conspicuous as required under EFTA section 919(a)(3)(A) and will thereby help senders understand the costs of remittance transactions. As discussed in the proposal, the formatting requirements demonstrate to senders the mathematical relationship between one line item and another, in part by presenting the required information in a logical sequence. Therefore, the Bureau is generally adopting the formatting requirements as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Commenters also raised concerns regarding the proposed formatting requirements as applied to disclosures provided via mobile application or text message. Industry commenters argued that prescriptive formatting requirements conducive to paper disclosures may not easily apply to new methods of conducting remittance transfers, and that the proposed rule could make compliance difficult as new technologies arise. These commenters urged the Bureau to provide flexibility for formatting requirements for disclosures provided via mobile application or text message. These commenters noted that formatting may be constrained by data and character limits, and that a remittance transfer provider does not necessarily control formatting when disclosures are sent through these methods.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters also noted that senders using mobile applications or text messages could incur additional costs due to the formatting requirements. For example, additional data charges may apply for disclosures provided via mobile application or text message to accommodate formatting requirements. These charges could make senders reluctant to make transfers via mobile application or text message and, therefore, create a disincentive for providers to make remittance transfers available through these alternative methods. They argued that the provider should have the flexibility to provide disclosures using various methods—such as text message, mobile application, email, internet, or mail—as long as the sender is capable of receiving the disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed above in the supplementary information to § 1005.31(a)(5), remittance transfer providers can provide oral pre-payment disclosures for transactions conducted by mobile application or text message. The Bureau does not believe senders would be less protected by receiving disclosures via mobile application or text message than if they received oral disclosures, even if the mobile applications and text messages are not subject to standard formatting requirements.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Therefore, the Bureau is generally not requiring in the final rule that pre-payment disclosures provided via mobile application or text message comply with the grouping, proximity, font size, and segregation requirements of the final rule. Though these disclosures are not subject to these formatting requirements in the final rule, the Bureau expects that providers will provide mobile application or text message disclosures in a logical sequence to demonstrate to senders the mathematical relationship between one line item and another in order to disclose the information clearly and conspicuously. Moreover, pre-payment disclosures provided via mobile application or text message must be provided in equal prominence to each other, as required in § 1005.31(c)(3), discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>31(c)(1) Grouping</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(c)(1) provided that the information about the transfer amount, fees and taxes imposed by the provider, and total amount of transaction must be grouped together. The purpose of this grouping requirement was to make clear to the sender that the total amount charged is comprised of the transfer amount plus any transfer fees and taxes. Proposed § 205.31(c)(1) also provided that the information about the transfer amount in the currency to be made available to the designated recipient, fees and taxes imposed by a person other than the provider, and amount received by the designated recipient must be grouped together. The purpose of this grouping requirement was to make clear to the sender how the total amount to be transferred to the designated recipient, in the currency to be made available to the designated recipient, would be reduced by fees or taxes charged by a person other than the remittance transfer provider.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comments on the proposed grouping requirements beyond the general comments about the proposed formatting requirements, discussed above. Thus, the Bureau is adopting the proposed requirement substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(c)(1), with revisions to address the applicability of the grouping requirements to mobile applications and text messages. Section 1005.31(c)(1) states that the information required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) generally must be grouped together. The information required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(v), (vi), and (vii) generally must be grouped together. Disclosures provided via mobile application or text message, to the extent permitted by § 1005.31(a)(5), need not be grouped together.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(c)(1)-1 is also adopted substantially as proposed. The comment clarifies that information is grouped together for purposes of subpart B if multiple disclosures are in close proximity to one another and a sender can reasonably calculate the total amount of the transaction, and the amount that will be received by the designated recipient. Proposed Model Forms A-30 through A-35 in Appendix A, discussed in more detail below, illustrate how information may be grouped to comply with the rule. The proposed comment also clarifies that a remittance transfer provider may group the information in another manner. For example, a provider could provide the grouped information as a horizontal, rather than a vertical, calculation.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>31(c)(2) Proximity</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(c)(2) provided that the exchange rate must be disclosed in close proximity to the other disclosures on the pre-payment disclosure. The Board stated in the May 2011 Proposed Rule that disclosing the exchange rate in close proximity to both the calculations that demonstrate the total transaction amount, as well as the total amount the recipient would receive, would help a sender understand the effect of the exchange rate on the transaction. Proposed § 205.31(c)(2) also provided that error resolution and cancellation disclosures must be disclosed in close proximity to the other disclosures on the receipt. The Board determined in consumer testing that providing a brief statement regarding error resolution and cancellation rights located near the other disclosures effectively communicated these rights to a sender. Therefore, the Board provided that the error resolution and cancellation disclosures should be closely proximate to the other disclosures on the receipt to prevent such disclosures from being overlooked by a sender.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comment on the proposed proximity requirements beyond the general comments addressing the proposed formatting requirements discussed above. Thus, the Bureau is adopting the proposed requirement substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(c)(2), with revisions to address the applicability of the proximity requirements to mobile applications and text messages. Section 1005.31(c)(2) states that the exchange rate disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) generally must be disclosed in close proximity to the other information required by § 1005.31(b)(1). The abbreviated statement about the sender's error resolution and cancellation rights required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) generally must be disclosed in close proximity to the other information required by § 1005.31(b)(2). Disclosures provided orally or via mobile application or text message, to the extent permitted by § 1005.31(a)(5), need not comply with the proximity requirements of § 1005.31(c)(2).</analysisParagraph>

        <title>31(c)(3) Prominence and Size</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(c)(3) set forth the requirements regarding the prominence and size of the disclosures required under subpart B. The proposed rule provided that written and electronic disclosures required by subpart B must be made in a minimum eight-point font. The Board solicited comment on whether a minimum font size should be required and, if so, whether an eight-point font size is appropriate.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter supported the eight-point font requirement. However, other industry commenters urged the Bureau to eliminate the eight-point font requirement. These commenters argued that the font requirement would add unnecessary compliance costs that did not have a corresponding consumer benefit. Industry commenters argued that the font requirement may not create the desired consistency in disclosures, because, for example, fonts may display differently on different screens and printers. Rather, these commenters believed the Bureau should only require that the disclosures be subject to either a clear and conspicuous or clear and readily understandable standard.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that disclosures should be disclosed in at least an eight-point font, as proposed. As discussed in the proposal, the disclosures that the Board developed for consumer testing used eight-point font, consistent with the font size typically used in register receipts. Participants in the Board's consumer testing generally found that the disclosures were readable, and they were able to locate the different disclosure elements during testing. The Bureau agrees with the Board that disclosures provided in a smaller font could diminish the readability and noticeability of the disclosures. Therefore, the eight-point font requirement is generally retained in the final rule. However, given the particular concerns raised above with respect to mobile disclosures, the final rule does not apply the font requirement to disclosures made by mobile application or text message, to the extent permitted by § 1005.31(a)(5).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(c)(3) further provided that written disclosures required by subpart B must be on the front of the page on which the disclosure is printed. The proposed paragraph also provided that each of the written and electronic disclosures required under proposed § 205.31(b) must be in equal prominence to each other. One industry commenter asked the Bureau to clarify how written and electronic disclosures should be disclosed in equal prominence to each other. As discussed in the proposal, disclosures that must be equally prominent to each other should be displayed in the same font and type size.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting the prominence and size requirement substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(c)(3), with revisions to address the applicability of the font size requirement to mobile applications and text messages and revisions to better clarify that only disclosures provided in writing or electronically must be provided in equal prominence to each other and in eight-point font. Section 1005.31(c)(3) states that written disclosures required by subpart B must be provided on the front of the page on which the disclosure is printed. Disclosures required by subpart B that are provided in writing or electronically must be in a minimum eight-point font, except for disclosures provided via mobile application or text message to the extent permitted by § 1005.31(a)(5). Disclosures required by § 1005.31(b) that are provided in writing or electronically must be in equal prominence to each other.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>31(c)(4) Segregation</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(c)(4) provided that written and electronic disclosures required by subpart B must be segregated from everything else and contain only information that is directly related to the disclosures required under subpart B. Proposed comment 31(c)(4)-1 clarified how a remittance transfer provider could segregate disclosures. Proposed comment 31(c)(4)-2 identified information that would be considered directly related to the required disclosures, for purposes of determining what information must be segregated from the required disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Board proposed the segregation of required disclosures from other information to avoid overloading the sender with information that could distract from the required disclosures. In permitting directly related information to be included with the required disclosures, the Board recognized that certain information not required by the statute or regulation could be integral to the transaction. The Board stated that remittance transfer providers should be able to communicate this information, such as the confirmation code that a designated recipient must provide in order to receive the funds, to a sender. The Board requested comment on the proposed segregation requirement and whether additional information should be permitted to be included with the required segregated disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters requested further guidance on the segregation requirement, including clarification regarding how disclosures presented on a computer screen could be segregated, and whether disclosures would be considered segregated in a variety of mailing scenarios, including when disclosures are mailed on or with a periodic statement. The Bureau believes proposed comment 31(c)(4)-1 provides sufficient guidance to enable providers to determine whether the disclosures are segregated in a variety of scenarios. For example, the comment requires segregated disclosures to be set off from other information, such as disclosures required by states, but does not require the information to be displayed on a separate sheet of paper. The comment also explains that disclosures may be set off from other information on a notice by outlining them in a box or series of boxes, with bold print dividing lines or a different color background, or by using other means. A provider could apply this guidance to develop, for example, segregated disclosures set off in a box on a periodic statement or set off with a different color background on a computer screen. Therefore, the Bureau is finalizing comment 31(c)(4)-1 substantially as proposed, but adds another example for clarity.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters also suggested that certain additional information should be deemed “directly related” to the required disclosures, such that it would not have to be segregated from the required disclosures. Suggested additions included information regarding the retrieval of funds, such as the number of days the funds will be available to the recipient before the funds are returned to the sender, and a statement that a provider makes money from foreign currency exchange. The Bureau agrees that this information is directly related to the required disclosures and need not be segregated from them. Therefore, the Bureau is adding these to the list of “directly related” items in comment 31(c)(4)-2.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting the segregation requirement substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(c)(4), with revisions to address the applicability of the requirement to mobile applications and text messages and revisions to better clarify that only disclosures provided in writing or electronically must be segregated. Section 1005.31(c)(4) states that except for disclosures provided via mobile application or text message, to the extent permitted by § 1005.31(a)(5), disclosures required by subpart B that are provided in writing or electronically must be segregated from everything else and must contain only information that is directly related to the disclosures required under subpart B. Comment 31(c)(4)-1 of the final rule clarifies that disclosures may be segregated from other information in a variety of ways. For example, the disclosures may appear on a separate sheet of paper or may be set off from other information on a notice by outlining them in a box or series of boxes, with bold print dividing lines or a different color background, or by using other means.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(c)(4)-2 in the final rule clarifies that, for purposes of § 1005.31(c)(4), the following is directly related information: (i) The date and time of the transaction; (ii) the sender's name and contact information; (iii) the location at which the designated recipient may pick up the funds; (iv) the confirmation or other identification code; (v) a company name and logo; (vi) an indication that a disclosure is or is not a receipt or other indicia of proof of payment; (vii) a designated area for signatures or initials; (viii) a statement that funds may be available sooner, as permitted by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii); (ix) instructions regarding the retrieval of funds, such as the number of days the funds will be available to the recipient before they are returned to the sender; and (x) a statement that the provider makes money from foreign currency exchange.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>31(b) Disclosures</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed section 205.31(b) set forth substantive disclosure requirements for remittance transfers. EFTA sections 919(a)(2)(A) and (B) require a remittance transfer provider to provide to a sender: (i) A written pre-payment disclosure with information applicable to the sender's remittance transfer—specifically, the exchange rate, the amount of transfer and other fees, and the amount that would be received by the designated recipient; and (ii) a written receipt that includes the information provided on the pre-payment disclosure, plus the promised date of delivery, contact information for the designated recipient, information regarding the sender's error resolution rights, and contact information for the remittance transfer provider and applicable regulatory agencies. EFTA section 919(a)(5)(C) also authorizes the Bureau to permit a remittance transfer provider to provide a single written disclosure to a sender, instead of a pre-payment disclosure and receipt, that accurately discloses all of the information required on both the pre-payment disclosure and the receipt. Section 1005.31(b)(1) and (2) finalize these substantive disclosure requirements for pre-payment disclosures and receipts, respectively. The final rule also permits the use of a combined disclosure, in lieu of the pre-payment disclosure and receipt, subject to the requirements in § 1005.31(b)(3).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed below, consumer group commenters opposed the combined disclosures, but otherwise generally supported the disclosures as proposed. These commenters stated that senders currently lack the information about exchange rate, fees, and timing that is required in the disclosures. Many industry commenters generally opposed the proposed disclosures. One industry commenter stated that the Board's consumer testing demonstrated that senders were satisfied with remittance transfer providers' existing disclosures, and that the new requirements would impose significant costs without commensurate benefits to senders.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters further argued that compliance with the disclosure requirements was not possible for wire transfers and international ACH transactions. Specifically, industry commenters opposed the requirements to disclose the exchange rate, fees and taxes imposed by a person other than the provider, and the date of funds availability. One money transmitter commenter stated that these disclosure requirements could also be problematic for some money transmitters, where an international wire transfer is part of the transaction, such as when a sender conducts an account-to-account remittance transfer through a money transmitter.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed below, the Bureau understands the unique compliance challenges for institutions that send remittance transfers via wire transfer or ACH. However, as previously noted, the statute specifically applies the disclosure requirements in EFTA sections 919(a)(2)(A) and (B) to both open network and closed network transactions and provides a specific accommodation to address the compliance challenges faced for open network transactions. As such, the final rule requires all remittance transfer providers to provide either the pre-payment disclosure and a receipt, or a combined disclosure, except to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to EFTA section 919(a)(2), information on a pre-payment disclosure and a receipt need only be provided to the extent applicable to the transaction. Similarly, the information required on a combined disclosure need only be provided as applicable because the combined disclosure is simply a consolidation of the pre-payment disclosure and the receipt. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A) and (B). Proposed comment 31(b)-1 clarified that a remittance transfer provider could choose to omit an inapplicable item provided in proposed § 205.31(b). Alternatively, a remittance transfer provider could disclose a term and state that an amount or item is “not applicable,” “N/A,” or “None.” The proposed comment provided examples of when certain disclosures may not be applicable. For example, if fees or taxes are not imposed in connection with a particular transaction, the provider need not provide the disclosures about fees and taxes generally required by proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(ii) and (vi). Similarly, a Web site need not be disclosed if the provider does not maintain a Web site. The proposed comment also included an example of instances in which exchange rate information was not required on the disclosures for transactions that are both funded and received in U.S. dollars.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One industry trade association commenter argued that dollar-to-dollar transactions should be completely excluded from the disclosure requirements. The Bureau believes, however, that fee and tax information should be disclosed to senders, even if there is no exchange rate applied to the transfer. The final rule does not exclude dollar-to-dollar transactions from the disclosure requirements, but clarifies that the exchange rate disclosure is not required for such transactions.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed, with clarifying revisions providing that an exchange rate is not required to be disclosed if an exchange rate is not applied to the transfer, even if it is not a dollar-to-dollar transaction. As such, the final comment states that a provider need not provide the exchange rate disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) if a recipient receives funds in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, or if funds are delivered into an account denominated in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded. For example, if a sender in the United States transfers funds from an account denominated in Euros to an account in France denominated in Euros, no exchange rate would need to be provided. Similarly, if a sender funds a remittance transfer in U.S. dollars and requests that a remittance transfer be delivered to the recipient in U.S. dollars, a provider need not disclose an exchange rate.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(b)-2 addressed the requirements in proposed § 205.31(b) that certain disclosures be described either using the terms set forth in § 205.31(b) or substantially similar terms. As discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the Board developed and selected the terms used in proposed § 205.31(b) through consumer testing to ensure that senders could understand the information disclosed to them. However, the May 2011 Proposed Rule provided remittance transfer providers with flexibility in developing their disclosures, both for disclosures in English and in each of the foreign languages principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfers, either orally or in writing, at that office. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(g) below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comment regarding proposed comment 31(b)-2, and it is finalized substantially as proposed. In the final rule, comment 31(b)-2 states that terms may be more specific than the terms used in the final rule. For example, a remittance transfer provider sending funds to Colombia may describe a tax disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) as a “Colombian Tax” in lieu of describing it as “Other Taxes.” Foreign language disclosures required under § 1005.31(g) must contain accurate translations of the terms, language, and notices required by § 1005.31(b).</analysisParagraph>

        <title>31(b)(1) Pre-Payment Disclosures</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A), proposed § 205.31(b)(1) stated that a remittance transfer provider must make specified pre-payment disclosures to a sender, as applicable. The disclosures are discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>31(b)(1)(i) Transfer Amount</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(i) provided that the remittance transfer provider must disclose the amount that will be transferred to the designated recipient using the term “Transfer Amount” or a substantially similar term. Under the proposal, the transfer amount would have to be disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be transferred because the Board believed the disclosure of the transfer amount would help demonstrate to a sender how a provider calculates the total amount of the transaction, discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters agreed that the disclosure of the transfer amount as a separate line item would help senders understand the total amount to be paid in order to send the requested amount of currency to a recipient. Industry commenters asked the Bureau to clarify how to make a disclosure in the currency in which funds will be transferred. These commenters asked if this requirement only applied where a remittance transfer provider performed the conversion. These commenters suggested that the final rule should clarify that the disclosures should be provided in the denomination of the account used to fund the transfer or in the currency submitted by the sender for the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that the transfer amount should be disclosed as proposed in order to help demonstrate the cost of the transfer to a sender. Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau deems is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to finalize this requirement in § 1005.31(b)(1)(i). For clarity, the final rule provides that the transfer amount must be disclosed in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, rather than the currency in which funds will be transferred. The Bureau believes that disclosing the transfer amount in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded—whether the sender pays with cash, with currency in an account, or by other means—will, when combined with the other required disclosures, help senders calculate the effect of the exchange rate on the transaction, if there is a currency exchange. For example, if the funds will be exchanged from U.S. dollars to Mexican pesos, the transfer amount required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(i) must be disclosed in U.S. dollars. Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(1)(i) provides that the remittance transfer provider must disclose the amount that will be transferred to the designated recipient, in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, using the term “Transfer Amount” or a substantially similar term.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>31(b)(1)(ii) Fees and Taxes Imposed by the Provider</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(ii) required that a remittance transfer provider disclose any fees and taxes that are imposed on the remittance transfer by the remittance transfer provider, in the currency in which the funds will be transferred. The proposal stated that the disclosure must be described using the term “Transfer Fees,” “Transfer Taxes,” or “Transfer Fees and Taxes,” or a substantially similar term. These disclosures were proposed pursuant to EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(ii), which requires a remittance transfer provider to disclose the amount of transfer fees and any other fees charged by the remittance transfer provider for the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.i. clarified that taxes imposed by the remittance transfer provider include taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a State or other governmental body. The proposed comment also provided guidance applicable to the disclosure of both fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider, as well as fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, which are discussed in detail below. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), below. The proposed comment addressed the requirement that a remittance transfer provider only disclose fees or taxes as applicable. The proposed comment also stated that if both fees and taxes are imposed, the fees and taxes may be disclosed as one disclosure or as separate, itemized disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters and an industry commenter argued that the Bureau should require itemized fees and tax disclosures. They believed itemized disclosures would help senders understand what costs are fixed, such as taxes, and what costs may vary depending on the provider, such as fees. However, another industry commenter stated that disclosing fees and taxes together provided senders with adequate information on the total cost of the transaction.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees that separately listing the fees and taxes on disclosures provides better information to the sender about fixed and variable costs of the transaction, and the final rule provides that fees and taxes must be disclosed separately. Section 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) also clarifies that the fees and taxes must be disclosed in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(b)(1)(i), above. Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) states that a remittance transfer provider must disclose any fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider, in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, using the terms “Transfer Fees” for fees and “Transfer Taxes” for taxes or substantially similar terms. Comment 31(b)(1)-1.i. in the final rule is changed from the proposal to state that if both fees and taxes are imposed, the fees and taxes must be disclosed as separate, itemized disclosures. For example, a provider would disclose all transfer fees using the term “Transfer Fees” or a substantially similar term and would separately disclose all transfer taxes as “Transfer Taxes” or a substantially similar term.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter argued that because a tax is imposed by the government, and not by the remittance transfer provider, EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(ii) does not require taxes to be disclosed and, as such, the rule should not require disclosure of taxes. The Bureau believes the statute intended to require the disclosure of all charges imposed on the remittance transfer that would affect the cost of a remittance transfer to the sender. To the extent taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a State or other governmental body are charged to the sender by the remittance transfer provider, the Bureau believes they are required to be disclosed under EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(ii), which requires a remittance transfer provider to disclose transfer fees and any other fees charged by the remittance transfer provider for the remittance transfer. Even if EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(ii) did not require that such taxes be disclosed to senders, the Bureau believes that disclosing the taxes imposed on the remittance transfer will demonstrate to the sender the calculation of the total amount that the sender pays for the transfer and how this amount relates to amount that will be received by the designated recipient and is therefore necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA. As such, to the extent necessary, the Bureau is also requiring these taxes to be disclosed pursuant to its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c). Therefore, as proposed, comment 31(b)(1)-1.i. in the final rule clarifies that taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the remittance transfer provider include taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a State or other governmental body.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, as proposed, comment 31(b)(1)-1.i. addresses the disclosure of fees and taxes that are applicable to the transfer. The comment in the final rule states that a provider need only disclose fees or taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider in § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) and imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), as applicable. For example, if no transfer taxes are imposed on a remittance transfer, a provider would only disclose applicable transfer fees.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii. distinguished between the fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider and the fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider. This proposed comment is addressed in the discussion regarding fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), below.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>31(b)(1)(iii) Total Amount of the Transaction</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(iii) required the disclosure of the total amount of the transaction. Although this total is not required by the statute, the Board proposed to require the disclosure of the total amount of the transaction to further the purposes of the EFTA by enabling a sender to understand the total amount to be paid out-of-pocket for the transaction. The Bureau did not receive comment on the proposed provision. Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to adopt § 205.31(b)(1)(iii) as proposed in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iii).The final rule requires a remittance transfer provider to disclose the total amount of the transaction, which is the sum of § 1005.31(b)(1)(i) and (ii), in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, using the term “Total” or a substantially similar term.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>31(b)(1)(iv) Exchange Rate</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(iv) required the disclosure of any exchange rate used by the provider for the remittance transfer, rounded to the nearest 1/100th of a decimal point, consistent with EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(iii). The proposed rule stated that the exchange rate must be described using the term “Exchange Rate” or a substantially similar term. The proposed rule did not permit floating rates, where the exchange rate is set when the designated recipient claims the funds.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters strongly supported the prohibition of unknown or floating exchange rates. Many industry commenters, however, urged that the final rule should accommodate floating rates and other circumstances in which an exchange rate may not be known at the time the sender requests the remittance transfer. A few industry commenters argued that the statute does not require the disclosure of an exchange rate set by institutions other than the remittance transfer provider. The commenters stated that by requiring the disclosure of the exchange rate to be used by the remittance transfer provider for the remittance transfer, EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(iii) only requires disclosure of an exchange rate that the remittance transfers provider itself set for the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For example, industry commenters stated that most credit unions offering international transfers do not perform currency conversions themselves, but instead rely on correspondent banks or other business partners to do so. Some industry commenters also stated that most credit unions offering international transfers work with currency providers in real time to contract for exchange rates. The commenters argued that this allows the credit unions to provide their members with the most competitive exchange rates. However, in such an arrangement the exchange rate that will be applied is only known at the time the contract is accepted, and would not be known at the time disclosures are provided to the senders. Similarly, other industry commenters stated that with their current processes and systems, they would know an exchange rate once a remittance transfer is processed, but not when the remittance transfer is requested.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters also stated the exchange rate cannot be determined at the time of the request when a sender designates the receipt of a transaction in one currency, but the receiving account is denominated in another currency. In those cases, the receiving institution must convert the funds into another currency in order to complete the transfer. One industry commenter stated that its customers sometimes request remittance transfers to be sent to their foreign accounts in U.S. dollars. These senders, however, have arrangements with the recipient institutions holding their foreign accounts to convert the funds to the currencies of the accounts either at the spot rates available at the time the accounts are credited or at rates pre-arranged by contracts between the senders and the recipient institutions. One industry commenter stated that, in some countries, a recipient may choose to be paid in one of multiple currencies. The commenter also stated that it permits consumers to change the designated country for pick up. In these cases, the currency in which funds will be received may change at the option of the recipient.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A Federal Reserve Bank commenter, as well as industry commenters, argued that requiring a fixed exchange rate for purposes of providing an exchange rate disclosure would result in less favorable exchange rates for senders. These commenters stated that if providers are required to fix the exchange rate, they will increase the spread they use in order to minimize the risks associated with rate volatility, so the cost of sending remittance transfers would increase for senders. One money transmitter commenter argued that requiring a disclosure of a fixed rate could also lead remittance transfer providers to stop providing services to some locations in which they have historically used floating rates. This commenter noted that such a requirement would require it to renegotiate its contracts with approximately 100 foreign agents representing about 10,000 locations that currently offer only floating rates. This commenter stated that this change would affect about a half million customers annually.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter believed that a remittance transfer provider should instead be permitted to disclose that the exchange rate will be changed at the rate set by a daily central bank or other official rate plus or minus a fixed offset, such as a commission. Other industry commenters suggested permitting disclosure of an estimated exchange rate, as long as the provider also discloses that the rate is subject to change. A Federal Reserve Bank commenter believed that floating exchange rate products should be exempted from the disclosure provisions in the rule.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau interprets the statute to require a remittance transfer provider to disclose to the sender the exchange rate to be used for the remittance transfer to the sender, both at the time the sender requests the remittance transfer and when the sender pays for the transfer. This interpretation is based on several factors. First, the fact that the exchange rate may be set by another institution involved in the remittance transfer does not change the fact that it will be used by the remittance transfer provider in effectuating the sender's request. Second, the statute specifically requires disclosure of the amount to be received by the designated recipient, using the values of the currency into which the funds will be exchanged. This disclosure requires a provider to determine the exchange rate to be used to effectuate the transfer, whether that rate is set by the remittance transfer provider or a third party.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The purpose of the statute supports the same conclusion. As discussed in the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the disclosure was intended to provide senders with certainty regarding the exchange rate and the amount of currency their designated recipients would receive. Senders would not be able to tell, for example, whether the funds they transmit are sufficient to pay household expenses and other bills where remittance products are based on floating rates.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau understands, however, that there may be instances in which a sender will request funds to be delivered in a particular currency, but the funds are later converted into another currency due to facts that cannot be known to the provider. In these circumstances, the Bureau believes the remittance transfer provider complies with the requirement to disclose the exchange rate when it discloses information based on the request of the sender, even if the funds are ultimately received in a different currency. If the sender does not know the currency in which the funds will be received or requests funds to be received in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, the Bureau believes that the provider may assume that the currency in which funds will be received is the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded. <em data-original="E-03">See also</em> comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-1, below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(b)(iv) of the final rule requires disclosure of the exchange rate used by the provider for the remittance transfer, as proposed. Comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-1 clarifies that if the designated recipient will receive funds in a currency other than the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, a remittance transfer provider must disclose the exchange rate to be used by the provider for the remittance transfer. An exchange rate that is estimated must be disclosed pursuant to the requirements of § 1005.32, discussed below. A remittance transfer provider may not disclose, for example, that an exchange rate is “unknown,” “floating,” or “to be determined.”</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-1 further clarifies that if a provider does not have specific knowledge regarding the currency in which the funds will be received, the provider may rely on a sender's representation as to the currency in which funds will be received for purposes of determining whether an exchange rate is applied to the transfer. For example, if a sender requests that a remittance transfer be deposited into an account in U.S. dollars, the provider need not disclose an exchange rate, even if the account is actually denominated in Mexican pesos and the funds are converted prior to deposit into the account. If a sender does not know the currency in which funds will be received, the provider may assume that the currency in which funds will be received is the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded. The Bureau notes that if a provider does not independently have specific knowledge of the currency in which funds will be received, the provider may rely on the sender's representation as to the currency in which funds will be received. For example, the rule does not impose on providers a duty to inquire about this information with a third party.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters also argued that the exchange rate should be permitted to include more than two decimal places, consistent with their current disclosure practices. One industry commenter stated that providing exchange rates that include more than two decimal places provides senders with more accurate and detailed exchange rate information.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees that it may be appropriate for some providers to disclose an exchange rate that includes more than two decimal places, because a provider may determine that the disclosure would provide a sender with a more accurate representation of the remittance transfer's cost, based on the particular type of transaction or type of currency being used. However, the Bureau also believes that some providers may determine that rounding to fewer digits may sufficiently inform senders of the cost of the exchange. The Bureau is also mindful that a disclosure that includes a long string of numbers could confuse some senders. The Bureau believes it is appropriate to permit a remittance transfer provider to disclose an exchange rate rounded to a number of decimal places that best reflects the cost to the sender, within a range that will not potentially confuse the sender.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) authority in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) to permit the exchange rate to be rounded consistently for each currency to no fewer than two decimal places and no more than four decimal places. The exchange rate must be disclosed using the term “Exchange Rate” or a substantially similar term. Comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-2 of the final rule is revised to reflect the more flexible rounding requirements. Comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-2 clarifies that the exchange rate disclosed by the provider for the remittance transfer is required to be rounded. The provider may round to two, three, or four decimal places, at its option. For example, if one U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9483779 Mexican pesos, a provider may disclose that the U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9484 Mexican pesos. The provider may alternatively disclose, for example, that the U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.948 pesos or 11.95 pesos. On the other hand, if one U.S. dollar exchanges for exactly 11.9 Mexican pesos, the provider may disclose that “US$1=11.9 MXN” in lieu of, for example, “US$1=11.90 MXN.”</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Though the Bureau is permitting flexibility for rounding exchange rate disclosures, the Bureau believes that each provider should disclose its exchange rates in a consistent manner. The Bureau believes that if a provider were permitted to round exchange rates for a particular currency on a transaction-by-transaction basis, a provider could round exchange rates differently in order to make the exchange rate appear to be more favorable. For example, the Bureau does not believe a provider that typically rounds to four decimal places for a specific currency (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> the U.S. dollar exchanges for 0.7551 Euros) should be permitted to round to two decimal places for some of those currency transactions (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> the U.S. dollar exchanges for 0.76 Euros). Comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-2 thus clarifies that the exchange rate disclosed for the remittance transfer must be rounded consistently for each currency. For example, a provider may not round to two decimal places for some transactions exchanged into Euros and round to four decimal places for other transactions exchanged into Euros.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, a provider may use an exchange rate that is not necessarily set by the provider itself. The final rule adds a new comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-3 to clarify that the exchange rate used by the provider and applied to the remittance transfer need not be set by that provider. For example, an exchange rate set by an intermediary institution and applied to the remittance transfer would be the exchange rate used for the remittance transfer and must be disclosed by the provider.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters and an industry trade association asked the Bureau to clarify how the exchange rate requirements would apply when a remittance transfer involves a prepaid card. These commenters asked how disclosures, such as the exchange rate, could be provided in accordance with the timing provisions in the May 2011 Proposed Rule when a provider would not know when the recipient would withdraw funds abroad or how much the recipient would withdraw. To the extent a prepaid card is covered by the rule, <em data-original="E-03">see</em> § 1005.30(e), the funds that will be received by the designated recipient are those that are loaded on to the prepaid card by the sender at the time of the transaction. Often a prepaid card is both funded and loaded in U.S. dollars, and funds remain on the card in U.S. dollars until a cardholder withdraws funds in a foreign country. In these instances, a provider need not provide the exchange rate disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), because a recipient will receive the currency in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 31(b)-1.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, a Federal Reserve Bank commenter noted that the exchange rate cannot be determined when a sender initiates payment on a recurring basis. The Bureau recognizes the unique challenges relating to recurring payments, and the final rule provides alternative provisions for these circumstances in § 1005.36, discussed below.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>31(b)(1)(v) Transfer Amount</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(v) generally required providers to repeat the disclosure of the transfer amount in proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(i). Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(v), however, required the transfer amount to be disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be received by the designated recipient to demonstrate to the sender how third party fees or taxes imposed under proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(vi), which are also required to be disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be received, would reduce the amount received by the designated recipient. Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(v), however, only required this repeat disclosure if third party fees or taxes are imposed under proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(vi), because it would not otherwise be necessary to demonstrate a reduction of the transfer amount by third party fees and taxes. The proposed disclosure was required to be described using the term “Transfer Amount” or a substantially similar term. Both the transfer amount required to be disclosed by proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(i) and the transfer amount required to be disclosed by proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(v) were proposed to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comment on the requirement to disclose the transfer amount in proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(v). Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to finalize this requirement as proposed in § 1005.31(b)(1)(v). The Bureau received comments regarding concerns about making disclosures in the currency in which the funds will be received by the designated recipient. These comments, and a clarification regarding the currency in which the funds will be received by the designated recipient, are discussed below. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-1.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(b)(1)-2 provided more guidance on the requirement to repeat the transfer amount disclosure in some circumstances, and it is adopted substantially as proposed. The comment reflects the clarification in the final rule that disclosure under § 1005.31(b)(1)(i) must be disclosed in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded. Comment 31(b)(1)-2 clarifies that two transfer amounts are required to be disclosed by § 1005.31(b)(1)(i) and (v). First, a provider must disclose the transfer amount in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded to show the calculation of the total amount of the transaction. Typically, the remittance transfer is funded in U.S. dollars, so the transfer amount would be expressed in U.S. dollars. However, if remittance transfer is funded, for example, from a Euro-denominated account, the transfer amount would be expressed in Euros.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Second, a provider must disclose the transfer amount in the currency in which the funds will be made available to the designated recipient. For example, if the funds will be picked up by the designated recipient in Japanese yen, the transfer amount would be expressed in Japanese yen. However, the comment also clarifies that this second transfer amount need not be disclosed if fees and taxes are not imposed for the remittance transfer under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). As discussed above, in such cases, there is no consumer benefit to the additional information if the transferred amount is not reduced by other fees and taxes.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(b)(1)(v) also requires a remittance transfer provider to use the term “Transfer Amount” or a substantially similar term to describe the disclosure required under this paragraph. Comment 31(b)(1)-2 clarifies, as proposed, that the terms used to describe each transfer amount should be the same.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau believes that the rounded exchange rate required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) is intended only to ensure that senders are not overwhelmed by a disclosure of an exchange rate with many numbers following the decimal point. The Bureau does not believe it is intended to constrain the number of decimal places involved in calculating other disclosures. Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(1)(v) adds the clarification that the exchange rate used to calculate the transfer amount in § 1005.31(b)(1)(v) is the exchange rate in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by § 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate. Comment 31(b)(1)-3 provides examples to demonstrate the exchange rate that must be used to calculate not only the transfer amount in § 1005.31(b)(1)(v), but also the fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) and the amount received in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii). For example, if one U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9483779 Mexican pesos, a provider must calculate these disclosures using this rate, even though the provider may disclose pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) that the U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9484 Mexican pesos. Similarly, if a provider estimates pursuant to § 1005.32 that one U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9483 Mexican pesos, a provider must calculate these disclosures using this rate, even though the provider may disclose pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) that the U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.95 Mexican pesos (Estimated). If an exchange rate need not be rounded, a provider must use that exchange rate to calculate these disclosures. For example, if one U.S. dollar exchanges for exactly 11.9 Mexican pesos, a provider must calculate these disclosures using this exchange rate.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>31(b)(1)(vi) Fees and Taxes Imposed by a Person Other Than the Provider</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(vi) stated that a remittance transfer provider must disclose any fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, in the currency in which the funds will be received by the designated recipient. Such fees and taxes could include lifting fees charged in connection with an international wire transfer, a fee charged by a recipient institution or agent, or a tax imposed by a government in the designated recipient's country. Because such fees and taxes affect the amount ultimately received by the designated recipient, the Board proposed the disclosure of other fees and taxes to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters supported the disclosure of third party fees and taxes to senders of remittance transfers, stating that such a disclosure would be consistent with the language and purpose of the statute, and would best inform the sender of the amount the recipient would ultimately receive. In contrast, industry commenters opposed the disclosure. Most industry commenters argued that compliance with the proposed disclosure requirement would be burdensome, if not impossible. Commenters stated that financial institutions sending wire transfers and international ACH transactions only have control over the delivery to the next institution, and in some cases do not have a relationship with all of the subsequent intermediary institutions involved in a transfer or with the recipient institution. The originating institution may, in some cases, know the routing, but in other cases have no legal or technological means to control routing of a transaction once the transfer has been initiated and, therefore, it cannot know what institutions might be imposing fees or taxes on the remittance transfer. One industry commenter suggested that providing the disclosures may be possible for repeat wire transfers, because fee and tax information is known from the previous transfers, but not for new wire transfers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters and a Federal Reserve Bank commenter argued that third party fees and taxes may not be known at the time of the transaction, which could result in the remittance transfer provider providing misleading information to the sender. Industry commenters also argued that smaller institutions do not have the resources to obtain or monitor information about foreign tax laws or fees charged by unrelated financial institutions that may be involved in the transfer. Some commenters noted that intermediary financial institutions, both inside and outside of the United States, are not required to disclose their fees. Moreover, some industry commenters argued, the sharing of fee information among financial institutions could violate privacy and competition laws. Industry commenters stated that no comprehensive information is available regarding foreign tax laws. Because an institution may not have resources to track tax laws in every foreign country to which it sends a remittance transfer, the commenters argued that some providers would limit the locations to which they send remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Further, some industry commenters noted that a recipient may enter into an agreement with a recipient institution that permits the institution to impose fees for an international payment received by the institution and applied to the recipient's account. The commenters stated that remittance transfer providers would not know whether the recipient has agreed to pay such fees or how much the recipient may have agreed to pay. The commenters argued that such fees charged to a recipient by a third party pursuant to an agreement between the recipient and a third party should not be required to be disclosed.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters argued that the statute did not intend for third party fees and taxes to be included in the disclosure of the total amount that will be received by the designated recipient. For example, one industry commenter argued that the statute only intended to include in the calculation of the amount of currency to be received the elements specifically required to be disclosed under EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii) (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the amount of transfer fees and any other fees charged by the remittance transfer provider, and any exchange rate to be used by the remittance transfer provider for the remittance transfer). Another industry commenter argued that State laws that require a remittance transfer provider to disclose to a sender the total amount to be received by the designated recipient do not require disclosure of third party fees and taxes that may be imposed on the remittance transfer. Instead, the commenters argued, State laws only require the remittance transfer provider to disclose the amount of currency to be received after application of the exchange rate. Therefore, the commenters stated that fees or taxes set by a party other than the remittance transfer provider are not required to be included in the disclosure of the total amount received and, therefore, should not be required to be disclosed separately.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Overall, many industry commenters stated that the proposed disclosure requirements would cause financial institutions to withdraw from the market or restrict the locations to which wire transfers will be sent. The commenters also stated that the proposed requirements would increase costs to senders, and some argued that the proposed requirements would delay transactions while financial institutions determined the required information in order to make disclosures. Some industry commenters argued that the requirements put financial institutions at a competitive disadvantage compared to money transmitters, which, they argued, are typically able to know the required disclosures due to their closed network structure. Further, they argued that the proposed requirements could deter foreign financial institutions from agreeing to process U.S.-originated remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Generally, industry commenters urged the Bureau to exempt financial institutions that provide remittance transfers through correspondent relationships from the requirement to disclose third party fees or require different disclosures for these types of transactions. Industry commenters and a Federal Reserve Bank commenter also suggested that the final rule should incorporate a good faith standard with respect to these fee and tax disclosures. Some industry commenters further argued that the Bureau should not require foreign taxes to be provided, regardless of whether a remittance transfer was sent through a correspondent relationship. Industry commenters alternatively suggested that the Bureau only require a disclosure that the amount received may be subject to foreign taxes. A Federal Reserve Bank commenter suggested that the Bureau should provide a safe harbor for the foreign tax disclosure for providers that disclosed current or historical information available to the provider through reasonable efforts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Commenters also suggested that the Bureau assist industry with determining unknown fees and taxes, particularly to help ease the disclosure burden on small providers. One industry commenter believed the Bureau should require correspondent institutions to publish the fees and taxes that are charged. Industry and consumer group commenters suggested that the Bureau should maintain a resource that provides relevant foreign taxes.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the introduction above, the Bureau recognizes the challenges for remittance transfer providers to determining fees and taxes imposed by third parties. However, the plain language of the statute requires disclosure of the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient. The Bureau believes this requires remittance transfer providers to determine the costs specifically related to the remittance transfer that may reduce the amount received by the designated recipient. Congress specifically recognized that these determinations would be difficult with regard to open network transactions by financial institutions and tailored a specific accommodation to allow use of reasonably accurate estimates for an interim period until financial institutions can develop methods to determine exact disclosures, such as fees and taxes charged by third parties.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>This disclosure provides consumer benefits by making senders aware of the impact of these fees and taxes, which is essential to fulfill the purpose of the statute. Providing a total to recipient that reflects the impact of third party fees and taxes, and separately disclosing those fees and taxes, will provide senders with a greater transparency regarding the cost of a remittance transfer. For many senders and recipients, disclosure of the amount of third party fees and taxes that may be deducted could be crucial to knowing whether the amount transferred will be sufficient to pay important household expenses and other bills. Senders also need to know the amount of such fees and taxes to determine whether to use the same provider for any future transfers. Without such information, it would be difficult for a sender to determine the costs of the transfer that would enable the sender to choose the most cost-effective method of sending remittance transfers. Moreover, as discussed below, the cost of third party taxes may vary depending on the types of institutions involved in the transmittal route, and disclosure of these taxes will assist senders comparing costs between providers. While the Bureau understands that tax information may not be readily available to a provider, the provider is in the best position to obtain the information to comply with the disclosure requirements. Because a provider will be engaged in sending remittance transfers to certain countries and, in some cases, will have relationships with entities in those countries, the Bureau believes the provider itself is in the best position to determine foreign tax information.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to require in § 1005.31(b)(vi) of the final rule the disclosure of any fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, using the terms “Other Fees” for fees and “Other Taxes” for taxes, or substantially similar terms.<footnote ref="76">Due to a scrivener's error, § 205.31(b)(vi) in the proposed rule had stated that these fees and taxes must be disclosed using the term “Other &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Transfer&lt;/em&gt; Fees,” “Other &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Transfer&lt;/em&gt; Taxes,” or “Other &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Transfer&lt;/em&gt; Fees and Taxes,” or a substantially similar term (emphasis added). The model forms as proposed, however, used the term “Other Fees and Taxes.” The terms set forth in § 1005.31(b)(vi) are adopted without the word “transfer” in order to more concisely describe the fees and taxes required to be disclosed in § 1005.31(b)(vi). The terms used in the final rule conform to the language used in the model forms, which participants in consumer testing generally understood to mean fees and taxes charged by a person other than the provider.</footnote>
             As discussed above, fees and taxes must be disclosed separately from one another in order to show which costs are fixed and which costs are variable. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 31(b)(1)-1.i. As discussed above, the Bureau believes that the rounded exchange rate required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) is not intended to constrain the number of decimal places involved in calculating other disclosures. Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) adds the clarification that the exchange rate used to calculate the fees and taxes in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) is the exchange rate in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by § 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate. As discussed above, comment 31(b)(1)-3 provides examples to demonstrate the exchange rate that must be used to calculate the fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As noted above, proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii. distinguished between the fees and taxes imposed by the provider, discussed above in § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii), and the fees and taxes imposed by a person other than the provider. The proposed comment provided examples of each of these types of fees and taxes. Proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii. also clarified that the terms used to describe each of these types of fees and taxes must differentiate between such fees and taxes and provided an example to illustrate this differentiation.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters requested clarification regarding the types of fees imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider. For example, an industry commenter and a Federal Reserve Bank commenter asked the Bureau to clarify that these fees and taxes do not include fees and taxes that banks and other parties charge one another for handling a remittance transfer, so long as the fees do not affect the amount of the transfer. Another industry commenter asked whether funds deducted from the amount received in a remittance transfer by a recipient institution exercising its rights of set-off would be required to be disclosed as a fee to a sender.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii. of the final rule clarifies that the fees and taxes required to be disclosed include only those that are charged to the sender or designated recipient and are specifically related to the remittance transfer. The Bureau does not believe that any fee or tax is required to be disclosed solely because it is charged at the same time that a remittance transfer is sent, because such fees and taxes are not necessarily “imposed on the remittance transfer.” For example, an overdraft fee charged by a bank at the same time that a remittance transfer is sent or received in an account is not imposed on the remittance transfer. In order to further clarify what charges should be disclosed to senders, the comment in the final rule provides examples of the types of fees that are not required to be disclosed under this provision, in addition to the examples of the types of fees that should be included that were included in the May 2011 Proposed Rule.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Specifically, comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii. states that the fees and taxes required to be disclosed by § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) include all fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider. For example, a provider must disclose a service fee and any State taxes imposed on the remittance transfer. In contrast, the fees and taxes required to be disclosed by § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) include fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider. Fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider include only those fees and taxes that are charged to the sender or designated recipient and are specifically related to the remittance transfer. For example, a provider must disclose fees imposed on a remittance transfer by the receiving institution or agent at pick-up for receiving the transfer, fees imposed on a remittance transfer by intermediary institutions in connection with an international wire transfer, and taxes imposed on a remittance transfer by a foreign government.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>However, the comment states that a provider need not disclose, for example, overdraft fees that are imposed by a recipient's bank or funds that are garnished from the proceeds of a remittance transfer to satisfy an unrelated debt, because these charges are not specifically related to the remittance transfer. Similarly, fees that banks charge one another for handling a remittance transfer or other fees that do not affect the total amount of the transaction or the amount that will be received by the designated recipient are not charged to the sender or designated recipient. For example, an interchange fee that is charged to a provider when a sender uses a credit or debit card to pay for a remittance transfer need not be disclosed. The comment also clarifies that the terms used to describe the fees or taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider in § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) and imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) must differentiate between such fees and taxes. For example, the terms used to describe fees disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) and (vi) may not both be described solely as “Fees.”</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-1 clarified how a provider must disclose fees and taxes in the currency in which funds will be received. Industry commenters expressed concern that a remittance transfer provider may not know the currency in which the funds will be received. As discussed above in comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-1, if a provider does not have specific knowledge regarding the currency in which the funds will be received, the provider may rely on a sender's representations as to the currency in which funds will be received.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed, with an added clarification regarding reliance on a sender's representation regarding the currency in which the funds will be received. The Bureau is also revising the comment to reflect the clarification that disclosures that require an exchange rate to be applied should use the exchange rate in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by § 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-1 states that § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) requires the disclosure of fees and taxes in the currency in which the funds will be received by the designated recipient. A fee or tax described in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) may be imposed in one currency, but the funds may be received by the designated recipient in another currency. In such cases, the remittance transfer provider must calculate the fee or tax to be disclosed using the exchange rate in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by § 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate. For example, an intermediary institution in an international wire transfer may impose a fee in U.S. dollars, but funds are ultimately deposited in the recipient's account in Euros. In this case, the provider would disclose the fee to the sender expressed in Euros, calculated using the exchange rate used by the provider for the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The comment further states that for purposes of § 1005.31(b)(1)(v), (vi), and (vii), if a provider does not have specific knowledge regarding the currency in which the funds will be received, the provider may rely on a sender's representation as to the currency in which funds will be received. For example, if a sender requests that a remittance transfer be deposited into an account in U.S. dollars, the provider may provide the disclosures required in § 1005.31(b)(1)(v), (vi), and (vii) in U.S. dollars, even if the account is denominated in Mexican pesos and the funds are subsequently converted prior to deposit into the account. If a sender does not know the currency in which funds will be received, the provider may assume that the currency in which funds will be received is the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The final rule also adds a new comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-2 to address situations where the information needed to determine the foreign taxes that apply to a transaction is not known to the provider and not publically available. Some industry commenters stated that foreign taxes may depend on variables other than the country to which the remittance transfer is sent, such as by the specific tax status of the sender and receiver, account type, or type of financial institution. The commenters stated that a sender may not be aware of the information needed to determine the tax obligation that applies to the transaction.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that when these types of variables affect the foreign taxes that apply to the transaction, providers may have to rely on representations made by the sender. If the sender does not know the information, and the provider does not otherwise have specific knowledge of the information, the Bureau believes it is necessary to provide a reasonable mechanism by which the provider may disclose the foreign tax. The Bureau believes it is appropriate in these instances to disclose the highest tax that could be imposed with respect to a particular variable, so the sender is not surprised that the amount received is reduced by more taxes than what is disclosed.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-2 states that the amount of taxes imposed by a person other than the provider may depend on the tax status of the sender or recipient, the type of accounts or financial institutions involved in the transfer, or other variables. For example, the amount of tax may depend on whether the receiver is a resident of the country in which the funds are received or the type of account to which the funds are delivered. If a provider does not have specific knowledge regarding variables that affect the amount of taxes imposed by a person other than the provider for purposes of determining these taxes, the provider may rely on a sender's representations regarding these variables, pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). If a sender does not know the information relating to the variables that affect the amount of taxes imposed by a person other than the provider, the provider may disclose the highest possible tax that could be imposed for the remittance transfer with respect to any unknown variable.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that if a provider does not independently have specific knowledge regarding variables that affect the amount of taxes imposed by a person other than the provider, the provider may rely on the sender's representations regarding these variables. For example, the rule does not impose on providers a duty to inquire about this information with a third party. The Bureau also notes that a provider may continue to rely on the sender's representations in any subsequent remittance transfers, unless the provider has specific knowledge that information relating to such variables has changed.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>31(b)(1)(vii) Amount Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(vii) stated that a remittance transfer provider must disclose to the sender the amount that will be received by the designated recipient, in the currency in which the funds will be received. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(i). The proposed rule stated that the disclosures should be described using the term “Total to Recipient” or a substantially similar term. The proposed rule provided that the disclosure must reflect all charges that would affect the amount to be received.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons discussed above, industry commenters objected to the proposal because, they argued, costs that are required to be known to disclose the amount received, such as the exchange rate and third party fees and taxes, cannot be known at the time the pre-payment disclosure and receipt are required to be disclosed. As discussed above, an industry commenter argued that the statute only intended the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient to reflect the other elements that are required to be disclosed separately under EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii). Other industry commenters argued that the disclosure should only reflect the exchange rate, fees, and taxes set by the remittance transfer provider itself, and not those set or charged by persons other than the provider. Some industry commenters believed the amount that will be received by the designated recipient should be subject to a good faith standard, should be permitted to be estimated, or should include a statement that the total amount is subject to change.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(i) requires a remittance transfer provider to disclose the amount received by the designated recipient using the values of the currency into which the funds will be exchanged. The Bureau interprets the amount to be received by the designated recipient as the amount net of all fees and taxes that will be paid for the transfer. An exchange rate, if one is applied, is just one of the factors that could affect the actual amount received by the designated recipient. Providing a total amount to be received that does not take into account all cost elements would not be consistent with the statute's goal of providing disclosures of the total costs of a remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is not persuaded that the amount to be received by the designated recipient should only reflect those elements that are separately required to be disclosed under the statute. Under the plain language of EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(i), the amount of funds that will be received by the designated recipient must be disclosed to the sender. The Bureau believes this amount must reflect all fees and taxes specifically related to the remittance transfer, regardless of the entity that charges them. Moreover, the Bureau believes that the exchange rate to be used to calculate the total to recipient is the exchange rate that is used for the remittance transfer, whether or not the remittance transfer provider itself sets the exchange rate or merely applies an exchange rate set by another entity to the transaction. Absent this approach, providers could disclose different amounts received depending only on whether the provider itself or a different institution applies the exchange rate. The Bureau believes such a result would be inconsistent with the statutory goal of providing the sender with the actual amount that will be received by the designated recipient.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Therefore, proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(vii) is adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii), with an addition to clarify the appropriate exchange rate that must be used to calculate the amount received, discussed below. Comment 31(b)(1)(vii)-1 is also adopted substantially as proposed to clarify the charges that must be reflected in the amount received. The comment is amended to clarify that the disclosed amount received must be reduced by the amount of any fee or tax, whether the fee or tax is imposed on the remittance transfer by the remittance transfer provider or by a person other than the remittance transfer provider. The comment clarifies that the fees and taxes that must be disclosed are those fees and taxes that are imposed on the remittance transfer. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 31(b)(1)-1-ii. Specifically, comment 31(b)(1)(vii)-1 states that the disclosed amount to be received by the designated recipient must reflect all charges imposed on the remittance transfer that affect the amount received, including the exchange rate and all fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the remittance transfer provider, the receiving institution, or any other party in the transmittal route of a remittance transfer. The disclosed amount received must be reduced by the amount of any fee or tax that is imposed on the remittance transfer by any person, even if that amount is imposed or itemized separately from the transaction amount.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) revises proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(vii) to clarify the exchange rate that should be used in calculating the amount received. One industry commenter stated that using a rounded exchange rate may add some <em data-original="E-03">de minimis</em> value to the amount received. For some currencies, this may result in a transaction amount being disclosed in a foreign currency for which no coins are available to complete the transaction. The commenter recommended a <em data-original="E-03">de minimis</em> exemption for error resolution triggered based on rounding. As discussed above, the Bureau believes that the rounded exchange rate required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) is not intended to constrain the number of decimal places involved in calculating other disclosures. Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) adds the clarification that the exchange rate used to calculate the amount received in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) is the exchange rate in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by § 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate. As discussed above, comment 31(b)(1)-3 provides examples to demonstrate the exchange rate that must be used to calculate the amount received.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>31(b)(2) Receipt</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(2) provided that a remittance transfer provider must disclose a written receipt to a sender when payment is made for the remittance transfer. As with the proposed pre-payment disclosure, the disclosures required on the receipt could be omitted if not applicable. The required disclosures are discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>31(b)(2)(i) Pre-Payment Disclosures on Receipt</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(i) provided that the same disclosures included in the pre-payment disclosure must be disclosed on the receipt, pursuant to EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(i)(I). As discussed above, the Bureau is requiring providers to disclose some information in the pre-payment disclosure, such as the transfer amount, that is not specifically required by EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A). The Bureau did not receive comment regarding the requirement to provide the same pre-payment disclosures on the receipt. Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to finalize that requirement in renumbered § 1005.31(b)(2)(i), as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>31(b)(2)(ii) Date Available</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(2) also provided for the disclosure of additional elements on the receipt. EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(i)(II) requires the disclosure of the promised date of delivery to the designated recipient on a receipt. The Board stated its belief that the statute requires disclosure of the date the currency will be available to the designated recipient, not the date the funds are physically picked up by the designated recipient, because the recipient may not pick up the funds for some period of time after the funds are available. Thus, proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(ii) stated that a remittance transfer provider must disclose the date of availability of funds to the designated recipient, using the term “Date Available” or a substantially similar term. Proposed comment 31(b)(2)-1 provided further guidance on this disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In the proposal, the Board recognized that in some instances, it may be difficult to determine the exact date on which a remittance transfer will be available to a designated recipient. For example, an international wire transfer may pass through several intermediary institutions prior to becoming available at the institution of a designated recipient, and the time it takes to pass through these intermediaries may be difficult to determine. As a result, the Board recognized that remittance transfer providers would likely disclose the latest date on which the funds would be available, even if funds are often available sooner. Thus, proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(ii) permitted a provider to include a statement that funds may be available to the designated recipient earlier than the date disclosed, using the term “may be available sooner” or a substantially similar term. The Board had tested various terms in consumer testing for communicating the fact that funds may be available earlier than the date disclosed. Participants generally understood the meaning of the statement that funds “may be available sooner” better than other terms.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters supported the disclosure of the date funds will be available. Many industry commenters argued, however, that it would be difficult or impossible to determine when funds would be made available to a recipient in an open network system, such as where transfers are made to an account at a financial institution with which the provider does not have a correspondent relationship. Industry commenters argued that even if the date of receipt by a recipient financial institution is known, there could be a delay in depositing the funds into a recipient account due to delays at intermediary financial institutions or at the recipient institution. One industry trade association stated that infrastructure deficiencies in some countries may make it impossible to determine the actual date on which funds will be available.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>An industry commenter supported the flexibility provided by the term “may be available sooner,” but stated that dates still may be unpredictable for reasons beyond a provider's control. One industry trade association argued that in order to mitigate compliance risks, some remittance transfer providers will disclose a date well past a reasonable estimate of the date funds will be made available, which would render the disclosure meaningless.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Due to these factors, some industry commenters urged the Bureau to permit an estimated date of availability, including an estimate of the date that funds may be available to a recipient institution, and not the recipient. One commenter suggested that the disclosure could state that a transfer may be delayed by intermediaries or other factors beyond the provider's control.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As stated in the proposal, EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(i)(II) requires disclosure of a single, promised date of delivery of the funds. Neither EFTA section 919(a)(4) nor EFTA section 919(c) permit a remittance transfer provider to provide an estimate of this promised date, despite the fact that the statute permits estimates in other circumstances. Moreover, because the statute requires a remittance transfer provider to provide a disclosure of the promised date of delivery to the designated recipient, the Bureau believes that permitting a provider to disclose the date that funds will be made available to the recipient institution would not comply with the statute.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that by permitting the provider to disclose a date by which funds will certainly be delivered, but also stating that funds “may be available sooner,” a provider can comply with the disclosure requirement. The Bureau recognizes that providers may overestimate the disclosed date on which funds will be available to mitigate compliance risks. However, the Bureau believes that competitive pressures will give providers an incentive to provide as accurate a date as possible.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) is finalized substantially as proposed. Section 1005.31(b)(2)(ii), however, clarifies in the rule, rather than the commentary, as proposed, that a provider must disclose the date in the foreign country on which funds will be available to the designated recipient. This clarification is included to account for instances where time zone differences result in a date in the United States being different from the date in the country of the designated recipient.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The final rule also adopts comment 31(b)(2)-1 substantially as proposed. The comment clarifies that a remittance transfer provider may not provide a range of dates that the remittance transfer may be available, nor an estimate of the date on which funds will be available. If a provider does not know the exact date on which funds will be available, the provider may disclose the latest date on which the funds will be available. For example, if funds may be available on January 3, but are not certain to be available until January 10, then a provider complies with § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) if it discloses January 10 as the date funds will be available. However, a remittance transfer provider may also disclose that funds “may be available sooner” or use a substantially similar term to inform senders that funds may be available to the designated recipient on a date earlier that the date disclosed. For example, the provider may disclose “January 10 (may be available sooner).”</analysisParagraph>

        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(iii) provided that a remittance transfer provider must disclose the name and, if provided by the sender, the telephone number and/or address of the designated recipient. The proposed rule stated that the remittance transfer provider must describe the disclosure using the term “Recipient” or a substantially similar term. The Bureau did not receive comment on proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(iii), which is adopted as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(b)(2)(iii).</analysisParagraph>

        <title>31(b)(2)(iv) Rights of Sender</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail below regarding §§ 1005.33 and 1005.34, EFTA section 919(d) provides the sender with substantive error resolution and cancellation rights. EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(ii)(I) requires a remittance transfer provider to provide a statement containing information about the rights of the sender regarding the resolution of errors on the receipt or combined disclosure. EFTA section 919(d)(3) requires the Bureau to issue final rules regarding appropriate cancellation and refund policies for senders. The Board stated its belief that providing a lengthy disclosure to the sender each time the sender makes a remittance transfer could be ineffective at conveying the most important information that a sender would need to resolve an error or cancel a transaction. However, the Board also stated that a sender should have access to a complete description of the sender's error resolution and cancellation rights in order to effectively exercise those rights. As a result, the Board proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(iv) in conjunction with a long form error resolution notice in proposed § 205.31(b)(4). The two disclosures were intended to balance the interest in providing a sender a concise disclosure with the sender's ability to obtain a full explanation of those rights.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(iv) stated that a remittance transfer provider must disclose to a sender an abbreviated statement about the sender's error resolution and cancellation rights using language set forth in Model Form A-37 of Appendix A or substantially similar language. The proposed statement included a brief disclosure of the sender's error resolution and cancellation rights, as well as a notification that a sender may contact the remittance transfer provider for a written explanation of these rights.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters argued that the abbreviated disclosure in proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(iv) should provide more comprehensive information to a sender. These commenters also suggested that the abbreviated disclosure would not comply with the statute. One of the consumer group commenters stated that all of the senders' rights should be disclosed on the receipt, instead of a shorter disclosure, because senders of remittance transfers may be less educated or less likely to have access to phone and internet compared to other consumers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees that education of senders about the consumer protections created by EFTA section 919 is an important statutory and policy goal. However, the Bureau believes EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(ii)(I) does not require a remittance transfer provider to enumerate a sender's error resolution rights. Rather, the statute requires the provider to disclose information about the rights of the sender under EFTA section 919 regarding the resolution of errors, and the Bureau believes the proposed language satisfies this requirement. Moreover, consumer testing participants understood and responded positively to the concise, abbreviated disclosure and favorably compared the statement against current error resolution disclosures with which they had experience and which they noted could be long and in “fine print.” Thus, the Bureau is finalizing the abbreviated disclosure requirement in renumbered § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv). <em data-original="E-03">See also</em> § 1005.31(b)(4), below. The Bureau, however, is amending the language in the abbreviated statement about senders' error resolution rights on Model Form A-37 to include a more explicit statement informing senders that they have such rights. The Bureau is also adding a requirement in § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) to account for the alternative cancellation requirements in § 1005.36(c) for remittance transfers scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, as discussed below. Section 1005.31(b)(2)(iv), therefore, also provides that for any remittance transfer scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, the statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation must instead reflect the requirements of § 1005.36(c).</analysisParagraph>

        <title>31(b)(2)(v) Contact Information of the Provider</title>
        <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(ii)(II) generally requires that the remittance transfer provider disclose appropriate contact information for the remittance transfer provider, its State regulator, and the Bureau. The Board stated that appropriate contact information includes the name, telephone number, and Web site of these entities, so that senders would have multiple options for addressing any issues that may arise with respect to a remittance transfer provider. Proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(v) provided for the disclosure of the name, telephone number, and Web site of the remittance transfer provider. The Bureau did not receive comment on proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(v), and the Bureau is finalizing it substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(b)(2)(v). The final rule adds language to allow providers to disclose more than one telephone number to account for circumstances, for example, where a provider maintains a separate TTY/TDD telephone number.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>31(b)(2)(vi) Agency Contact Information</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(vi) provided for disclosure of a statement that the sender can contact the State agency that regulates the remittance transfer provider and the Bureau for questions or complaints about the remittance transfer provider, using language set forth in Model Form A-37 of Appendix A or substantially similar language. The proposed statement included contact information for these agencies, including the toll-free telephone number of the Bureau established under section 1013 of the Dodd-Frank Act.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Board requested comment on several aspects of proposed § 205.31(b)(2)(vi). First, the Board solicited comment on whether and how a remittance transfer provider should be required to disclose information regarding a State agency that regulates the provider for remittance transfers conducted through a toll-free telephone number or online and, if so, what would be the appropriate State agency to disclose to a sender. Some commenters believed the disclosure of Bureau contact information would be sufficient. Several industry commenters argued that the Bureau should not require a remittance transfer provider to disclose the State agency that regulates the remittance transfer. These commenters believed the requirement would create operational hurdles for providers that operate in multiple states and would provide negligible consumer protection benefit.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One money transmitter commenter stated that it would be difficult to tailor State regulator disclosures to each individual agent, and that managing State-specific receipts and forms would be costly. This commenter stated that agents that provide services in multiple states often distribute forms to their locations as part of their chain of distribution. Requiring these agents to manage State-specific forms, the commenter argued, would be a significant change in distribution processes and could create liability risk for the remittance transfer provider. This commenter believed remittance transfer providers would thus create a multi-State disclosure form, which would provide senders with superfluous information.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Another money transmitter commenter noted that many states already have guidance regarding the prominence and placement of contact information on a remittance transfer provider's Web site and in storefront locations. The commenter stated that many states prefer senders to contact the remittance transfer provider before contacting a State agency for questions and complaints. The commenter believed that the Bureau should instead require a statement that would refer to other sources, such as a Web site or toll-free number, to obtain contact information for the appropriate State agency, and that the Bureau should maintain contact information for State agencies, so that senders could contact the Bureau for appropriate State agency information.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(ii)(II) requires a remittance transfer provider to provide appropriate contact information for the State agency that regulates the remittance transfer provider. The Bureau does not believe that providing contact information for an alternative source that maintains a list of State agencies would satisfy the statutory requirement. The Bureau recognizes that remittance transfer providers that have locations in multiple states, or that provide remittance transfers online or by telephone, will have to determine the appropriate State agency to disclose on a receipt. The Bureau believes that due to segregation and other formatting requirements, discussed below, a remittance transfer provider may not disclose contact information for agencies in other states. Therefore, the final rule maintains the requirement to disclose information regarding a State agency that regulates the remittance transfer provider.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>However, several changes are made in the final rule to clarify which State agency should be disclosed, because a remittance transfer provider may be regulated by more than one agency in a particular State. The Bureau believes that the statute is meant to provide senders a resource for addressing problems regarding a particular remittance transfer and that the State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider is the appropriate State agency to provide such assistance to senders. Thus, in § 1005.31(b)(2)(vi), the final rule adds the clarification that the disclosure must disclose the State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider with respect to the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Second, the Board requested comment on whether a remittance transfer provider should be required to disclose the contact information for the Bureau, including the toll-free telephone number, in cases where the Bureau is not the primary Federal regulator for consumer complaints against the remittance transfer provider. The Board also requested comment on whether it would be appropriate to instead require the contact information of the primary Federal regulator of the remittance transfer provider for consumer complaints.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters and an industry commenter stated that the Bureau's contact information should be included on the receipt. These commenters stated that listing the Bureau's contact information, rather than the primary Federal regulator, would ensure that consumer complaints about remittance transfer provider were centralized in one Federal agency. The commenter suggested that even if the Bureau does not directly regulate a remittance transfer provider, the Bureau could track complaints and launch an investigation if a pattern and practice of non-compliance emerges.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau agrees that it is appropriate to provide the Bureau's contact information, even in instances where the Bureau is not the provider's primary Federal regulator, as required by EFTA section 919(a)(2)(B)(ii)(II)(bb). The Bureau believes that providing a single Federal agency as the appropriate contact for senders will assist in tracking complaints. The Bureau is not requiring a separate disclosure of a primary Federal regulator in the final rule, because the disclosure of multiple Federal agencies could confuse senders. Instead, the Bureau believes consumers are better served by contacting the Bureau, which can direct senders to the appropriate Federal agency as necessary. Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(2)(vi) in the final rule requires a remittance transfer provider to disclose the contact information for the Bureau, including the toll-free telephone number.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Board requested comment on whether financial institutions that are primarily regulated by Federal banking agencies, such as national banks, should be required to disclose State regulatory agency information. The Board requested comment regarding the circumstances in which it might be appropriate to disclose such a State regulatory agency.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters stated that the rule should only require Federally-chartered depository institutions to provide contact information for their primary Federal regulator. One industry commenter argued that providing information regarding State regulators would be confusing and ineffective, since its primary Federal regulator already has an established procedure for addressing errors.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes the final rule sufficiently accounts for circumstances in which an institution may not be licensed or chartered by a State agency. Under the final rule, the provider must disclose the State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider. However, disclosures must only be disclosed as applicable. Consequently, if no State agency licenses or charters a particular provider, then no State agency is required to be disclosed.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adding several other changes to § 1005.31(b)(2)(vi) in the final rule for clarity. The final rule adds language to allow providers to disclose more than one telephone number for the State agency that licenses or charters the provider and the Bureau to account for circumstances, for example, where these agencies maintain separate TTY/TDD telephone numbers. The provision also adds the requirement that a remittance transfer provider must disclose the name of both the State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider and the Bureau, in addition to the telephone number(s) and Web site of each agency.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(b)(2)(vi) of the final rule states that a remittance transfer must provide a statement that the sender can contact the State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider with respect to the remittance transfer and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for questions or complaints about the remittance transfer provider. The statement must use the language set forth in Model Form A-37 of Appendix A to this part or substantially similar language. The disclosure also must provide the name, telephone number(s), and Web site of the State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider with respect to the remittance transfer and the name, toll-free telephone number(s), and Web site of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(2)-2 has been added to the final rule to clarify that a remittance transfer provider must only disclose information about a State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider with respect to the remittance transfer, as applicable. For example, if a financial institution is solely regulated by a Federal agency, and not licensed or chartered by a State agency, then the institution need not disclose information about a State agency and would solely disclose information about the Bureau, whether or not the Bureau is the provider's primary Federal regulator.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The final rule also adds comment 31(b)(2)-3 to clarify that a remittance transfer provider must only disclose information about one State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider with respect to the remittance transfer, even if other State agencies also regulate the remittance transfer provider. For example, a provider may disclose information about the State agency which granted its license. If a provider is licensed in multiple states, and the State agency that licenses the provider with respect to the remittance transfer is determined by a sender's location, a provider may make the determination as to the State in which the sender is located based on information that is provided by the sender and on any records associated with the sender. For example, if the State agency that licenses the provider with respect to an online remittance transfer is determined by a sender's location, a provider could rely on the sender's statement regarding the State in which the sender is located and disclose the State agency that licenses the provider in that State. A State-chartered bank must disclose information about the State agency that granted its charter, regardless of the location of the sender.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>31(b)(3) Combined Disclosure</title>
        <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(5)(C) grants the Bureau authority to permit a remittance transfer provider to provide to a sender a single written disclosure instead of the pre-payment disclosure and receipt, if the information disclosed is accurate at the time at which payment is made. The combined disclosure must include the content provided in the pre-payment disclosure and the receipt under EFTA sections 919(a)(2)(A) and (B). As discussed above, the Bureau is also requiring providers to disclose some information in the pre-payment disclosure and receipt, such as the transfer amount, that is not specifically required by EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A) or (B). The Board determined through consumer testing that participants understood the information provided on the combined disclosure, and about half of the participants stated that they would prefer to receive the single, combined disclosure rather than a pre-payment disclosure and a separate receipt. Therefore, proposed § 205.31(b)(3) generally permitted a remittance transfer provider to provide the disclosures described in proposed § 205.31(b)(1) and (2) in a single disclosure prior to payment, as applicable, as an alternative to providing the two disclosures described in proposed § 205.31(b)(1) and (2).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters urged the Bureau not to permit combined disclosures. One consumer group commenter stated that requiring both a pre-payment disclosure and a receipt would permit consumers to audit the transaction and ensure that providers do not impose hidden fees. This commenter noted that the combined disclosure would not likely reduce compliance burdens for providers because State laws may already mandate a post-transaction receipt. Another consumer group commenter argued that two disclosures were necessary to perform two different legal functions. This commenter stated that a pre-transaction disclosure serves as an offer that provides terms of written contract, and a receipt indicates that the contract has been agreed upon. This commenter believed a combined disclosure would be too confusing to senders and that the proposed rule did not address how the combined disclosure will ensure information is accurate. Some industry commenters argued that the Bureau should permit the combined disclosure, but maintained that it should be permitted to be provided after payment is made. <em data-original="E-03">See also</em> § 1005.31(e), discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Some consumer testing participants stated that they would prefer to receive a pre-payment disclosure and a receipt because they were concerned that the combined disclosure would not provide proof of payment for the remittance transfer. Therefore, in the proposal, the Board solicited comment on whether proof of payment should also be required for remittance transfer providers using the combined disclosure and, if so, solicited comment on appropriate methods of demonstrating proof of payment for the combined disclosure. Consumer group commenters contended that methods for providing proof of payment could not be adequately set forth in the final rule. An industry commenter argued against requiring proof of payment for the combined disclosure, based on the challenges posed by the required timing of combined disclosures. Another industry commenter maintained that senders were satisfied with the existing proof of payment provided to them.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes a combined disclosure has benefits. Based on the Board's consumer testing, the Bureau believes that senders will understand the combined disclosures provided to them and that some senders will prefer to receive disclosures in a combined format. As discussed with respect to § 1005.31(f), below, the provider must ensure that the combined disclosure is accurate when payment is made. Moreover, the Bureau believes that the combined disclosure could reduce the compliance burden for some providers because the provider would only be required to provide one disclosure, rather than two, with mandated content in a specified format. Therefore, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to permit this alternative disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>However, the Bureau also believes that senders need to be able to confirm that they have completed the transaction. A proof of payment enables senders to demonstrate that the combined disclosure they received was part of a completed transaction. A proof of payment would also help remittance transfer providers determine which transfers have actually been completed, so that a sender cannot assert error resolution rights based on a combined disclosure, where a sender has not made payment for the transfer. Thus, the Bureau is adding a proof of payment requirement to the final rule.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to finalize the combined disclosure requirement. Section 1005.31(b)(3) states that as an alternative to providing the disclosures described in § 1005.31(b)(1) and (2), a remittance transfer provider may provide the disclosures described in § 1005.31(b)(2), as applicable, in a single disclosure pursuant to the timing requirements of § 1005.31(e)(1). If the remittance transfer provider provides the combined disclosure and the sender completes the transfer, the remittance transfer provider must provide the sender with proof of payment when payment is made for the remittance transfer. The proof of payment must be clear and conspicuous, provided in writing or electronically, and provided in a retainable form. The final rule also adds new comment 31(b)(3)-1, which clarifies that the combined disclosure must be provided to the sender when the sender requests the remittance transfer, but prior to payment for the transfer, pursuant to § 1005.31(e)(1), and the proof of payment must be provided when payment is made for the remittance transfer. The comment also clarifies that the proof of payment for the transaction may be provided on the same piece of paper as the combined disclosure or on a separate piece of paper. For example, a provider may feed a combined disclosure through a computer printer when payment is made to add the date and time of the transaction, a confirmation code, and an indication that the transfer was paid in full. A provider may also provide this additional information to a sender on a separate piece of paper when payment is made.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that the use of the term “proof of payment” does not suggest or establish an evidentiary standard. The requirement to provide a sender with proof of payment is only intended to convey to a sender that payment has been received. To this end, new comment 31(b)(3)-1 also clarifies that a remittance transfer provider does not comply with the requirements of § 1005.31(b)(3) by providing a combined disclosure with no further indication that payment has been received.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>31(b)(4) Long Form Error Resolution and Cancellation Notice</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(4) stated that a remittance transfer provider must provide a notice to the sender describing the sender's error resolution and cancellation rights under proposed §§ 205.33 and 205.34 upon the sender's request. As discussed above, consumer group commenters argued that comprehensive error resolution and cancellation rights should be stated on the receipt or combined disclosure in lieu of an abbreviated disclosure, and not only upon request by a sender. The Bureau is retaining the abbreviated disclosure in the final rule. However, the Bureau also believes that a sender must have access to a complete description of the sender's error resolution and cancellation rights.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The requirement to provide a long form error resolution and cancellation notice is adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(b)(4). The final rule adds the requirement that the notice must be provided promptly to the sender. The Bureau believes that adding a timing requirement to the provision will ensure that providers do not delay in providing the notice to a sender, and the requirement to provide notices promptly is consistent with other provisions in Regulation E. <em data-original="E-03">See, e.g.,</em> § 1005.11(d)(1). Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(4) states that, upon the sender's request, a remittance transfer provider must promptly provide to the sender a notice describing the sender's error resolution and cancellation rights, using language set forth in Model Form A-36 of Appendix A to this part or substantially similar language. As discussed above with respect to § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv), the Bureau is adding a requirement in § 1005.31(b)(4) to account for the alternative cancellation requirements in § 1005.36(c) for remittance transfers scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, as discussed below. Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(4) also provides that for any remittance transfer scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, a description of the rights of the sender regarding cancellation must instead reflect the requirements of § 1005.36(c).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>31(b)(1)(vii) Amount Received</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(vii) stated that a remittance transfer provider must disclose to the sender the amount that will be received by the designated recipient, in the currency in which the funds will be received. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(i). The proposed rule stated that the disclosures should be described using the term “Total to Recipient” or a substantially similar term. The proposed rule provided that the disclosure must reflect all charges that would affect the amount to be received.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For the reasons discussed above, industry commenters objected to the proposal because, they argued, costs that are required to be known to disclose the amount received, such as the exchange rate and third party fees and taxes, cannot be known at the time the pre-payment disclosure and receipt are required to be disclosed. As discussed above, an industry commenter argued that the statute only intended the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient to reflect the other elements that are required to be disclosed separately under EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii). Other industry commenters argued that the disclosure should only reflect the exchange rate, fees, and taxes set by the remittance transfer provider itself, and not those set or charged by persons other than the provider. Some industry commenters believed the amount that will be received by the designated recipient should be subject to a good faith standard, should be permitted to be estimated, or should include a statement that the total amount is subject to change.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(i) requires a remittance transfer provider to disclose the amount received by the designated recipient using the values of the currency into which the funds will be exchanged. The Bureau interprets the amount to be received by the designated recipient as the amount net of all fees and taxes that will be paid for the transfer. An exchange rate, if one is applied, is just one of the factors that could affect the actual amount received by the designated recipient. Providing a total amount to be received that does not take into account all cost elements would not be consistent with the statute's goal of providing disclosures of the total costs of a remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is not persuaded that the amount to be received by the designated recipient should only reflect those elements that are separately required to be disclosed under the statute. Under the plain language of EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(i), the amount of funds that will be received by the designated recipient must be disclosed to the sender. The Bureau believes this amount must reflect all fees and taxes specifically related to the remittance transfer, regardless of the entity that charges them. Moreover, the Bureau believes that the exchange rate to be used to calculate the total to recipient is the exchange rate that is used for the remittance transfer, whether or not the remittance transfer provider itself sets the exchange rate or merely applies an exchange rate set by another entity to the transaction. Absent this approach, providers could disclose different amounts received depending only on whether the provider itself or a different institution applies the exchange rate. The Bureau believes such a result would be inconsistent with the statutory goal of providing the sender with the actual amount that will be received by the designated recipient.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Therefore, proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(vii) is adopted substantially as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii), with an addition to clarify the appropriate exchange rate that must be used to calculate the amount received, discussed below. Comment 31(b)(1)(vii)-1 is also adopted substantially as proposed to clarify the charges that must be reflected in the amount received. The comment is amended to clarify that the disclosed amount received must be reduced by the amount of any fee or tax, whether the fee or tax is imposed on the remittance transfer by the remittance transfer provider or by a person other than the remittance transfer provider. The comment clarifies that the fees and taxes that must be disclosed are those fees and taxes that are imposed on the remittance transfer. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 31(b)(1)-1-ii. Specifically, comment 31(b)(1)(vii)-1 states that the disclosed amount to be received by the designated recipient must reflect all charges imposed on the remittance transfer that affect the amount received, including the exchange rate and all fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the remittance transfer provider, the receiving institution, or any other party in the transmittal route of a remittance transfer. The disclosed amount received must be reduced by the amount of any fee or tax that is imposed on the remittance transfer by any person, even if that amount is imposed or itemized separately from the transaction amount.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) revises proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(vii) to clarify the exchange rate that should be used in calculating the amount received. One industry commenter stated that using a rounded exchange rate may add some <em data-original="E-03">de minimis</em> value to the amount received. For some currencies, this may result in a transaction amount being disclosed in a foreign currency for which no coins are available to complete the transaction. The commenter recommended a <em data-original="E-03">de minimis</em> exemption for error resolution triggered based on rounding. As discussed above, the Bureau believes that the rounded exchange rate required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) is not intended to constrain the number of decimal places involved in calculating other disclosures. Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) adds the clarification that the exchange rate used to calculate the amount received in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) is the exchange rate in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by § 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate. As discussed above, comment 31(b)(1)-3 provides examples to demonstrate the exchange rate that must be used to calculate the amount received.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>31(b)(1)(vii) Amount Received</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) of the 2012 Final Rule implements EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(i) by requiring that a remittance transfer provider disclose to the sender the amount that will be received by the designated recipient, in the currency in which the funds will be received.  As adopted by the 2012 Final Rule, this disclosure must reflect all charges that would affect the amount to be received including any recipient institution fees and taxes imposed by a person other than the provider.  As stated above, the Bureau is exercising its exception authority under EFTA section 904(c) to revise § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) to eliminate the requirement to include non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the provider in the calculation of the amount received, consistent with the narrowed scope of § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). Section 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) of the 2013 Final Rule thus provides that the disclosed amount must be disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be received, using the term “Total to Recipient” or a substantially similar term except that this amount shall not include any non-covered third party fee or tax collected by a person other than the provider, whether such fee or tax is disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii). </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>While § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) gives the provider the option to disclose non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, as discussed below, a provider cannot, in any circumstance, include these amounts in the amount disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii).  The Bureau believes that eliminating the requirement to include non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider in the calculation of the disclosed amount to be received by the designated recipient is necessary and proper to facilitate compliance and further the purposes of the EFTA because the Bureau is concerned that requiring disclosure of such amounts within the amount disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) might hamper senders' ability to make informed comparisons across similar providers. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The 2013 Final Rule also makes conforming edits to comment 31(b)(1)(vii) to clarify that the amount disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) must reflect the exchange rate, all fees imposed and all taxes collected on the remittance transfer by the provider, as well as any covered third-party fees as provided by § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi).  The Bureau recognizes that in some cases the amount disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) will not reflect the amount that the designated recipient will ultimately receive due to additional non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider. </analysisParagraph>

      <title>36(c) Cancellation</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Under § 1005.34(a), senders are permitted to cancel a remittance transfer if the request to cancel the remittance transfer is received by the provider no later than 30 minutes after the sender makes payment in connection with the remittance transfer, if certain conditions are met. As noted above, for purposes of subpart B, payment is made when payment is authorized. The Bureau believes that requiring a sender to cancel a transaction no later than 30 minutes after payment is authorized would not be appropriate for certain remittance transfers that a sender schedules in advance, including preauthorized remittance transfers. Such a rule would permit cancellation only for a short time after the transfers are authorized, even though the remittance transfer may not occur for many days, weeks, or months. For example, if on March 1 a sender scheduled a remittance transfer for March 23, under the general cancellation rule, the sender would be required to cancel 30 minutes after the transfer was authorized on March 1, despite the fact that the transfer is not being made until March 23. The Bureau believes it is appropriate to adopt a different cancellation period in these circumstances because payment is authorized well before the transfer is to be made.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Consequently, the Bureau is adopting a special cancellation rule in § 1005.36(c) that it believes is more appropriate for these types of transfers. Section 1005.36(c) states that, for any remittance transfer scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, a remittance transfer provider shall comply with any oral or written request to cancel the remittance transfer from the sender if the request to cancel: (i) Enables the provider to identify the sender's name and address or telephone number and the particular transfer to be cancelled; and (ii) is received by the provider at least three business days before the scheduled date of the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that this time period is more beneficial to senders because it generally provides them more time to decide whether to go through with a scheduled transfer. Senders will have the opportunity to change their minds about sending a transfer if, for example, circumstances change between when the transfer is authorized and when the transfer is to be made. At the same time, the Bureau believes that requiring a sender to cancel at least three days before a transfer is made gives providers sufficient time to process any cancellation requests before a transfer is made. Many financial institutions that permit senders to schedule remittance transfers at least three business days before the date of the transfer are already subject to the stop payment provisions in Regulation E for preauthorized transfers that are EFTs, which require consumers to notify the institution at least three business days before the scheduled date of a preauthorized EFT. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.10(c).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The cancellation provisions in both §§ 1005.34(a) and 1005.36(c) permit a sender to cancel a remittance transfer after the transfer has been authorized. Under both provisions, a cancellation period may expire before the transfer itself is made. As noted above, the Bureau expects financial institutions making transfers by ACH or wire transfer may decide to wait to execute the payment order until the cancellation period has passed because these types of remittance transfers generally cannot easily be cancelled once the payment order has been accepted by the sending institution. For the same reason, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to require a sender to cancel before a transfer is made in § 1005.36(c).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Under § 1005.36(c), a transfer must be cancelled only if the request to cancel is received by the provider at least three business days before the scheduled date of the remittance transfer, so that a provider has sufficient time to prevent the transfer from taking place on the scheduled date. Therefore, under the final rule, only transfers scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer are subject to the cancellation requirements in § 1005.36(c). Remittance transfers that are scheduled less than three business days before the date of the transfer are subject to the cancellation requirements in § 1005.34(a). For example, if a sender on March 1 requests a remittance transfer provider to send a wire transfer to pay a bill in a foreign country on March 3, the sender may cancel up to 30 minutes after scheduling the payment on March 1. Thus, in every case, a sender has an opportunity to cancel a remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting commentary to provide further guidance on the application of § 1005.36(c). Comment 36(c)-1 clarifies that a remittance transfer is scheduled if it will require no further action by the sender to send the transfer after the sender requests the transfer. For example, a remittance transfer is scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, and § 1005.36(c) applies, where a sender on March 1 requests a remittance transfer provider to send a wire transfer to pay a bill in a foreign country on March 15, if it will require no further action by the sender to send the transfer after the sender requests the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Comment 36(c)-1 also clarifies three circumstances where the provisions of § 1005.36(c) do not apply, such that a provider should instead comply with the 30-minute cancellation rule in § 1005.34. For example, § 1005.36(c) does not apply when a sender on March 1 requests a remittance transfer provider to send a wire transfer to pay a bill in a foreign country on March 3. In this instance, § 1005.36(c) does not apply because the transfer is scheduled less than three business days before the date of the transfer. Section 1005.36(c) also does not apply when a sender on March 1 requests that a remittance transfer provider send a remittance transfer on March 15, but the provider requires the sender to confirm the request on March 14 in order to send the transfer. In this example, § 1005.36(c) does not apply because the transfer requires further action by the sender to send the transfer after the sender requests the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The other example in comment 36(c)-1 demonstrates situations where § 1005.36(c) does not apply because a transfer occurs more than three days after the date the sender requests the transfer solely due to the provider's processing time and not because a sender schedules the transfer at least three business days before the date of the transfer. For example, § 1005.36(c) does not apply when a sender on March 1 requests that a remittance transfer provider send an ACH transfer, and that transfer is sent on March 2, but due to the time required for processing, funds are not deducted from the sender's account until March 5.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Comment 36(c)-2 clarifies how a remittance transfer provider should treat requests to cancel preauthorized remittance transfers in a manner consistent with the stop payment provisions of Regulation E. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.10(c) and comment 10(c)-2. The comment clarifies that for preauthorized remittance transfers, the provider must assume the request to cancel applies to all future preauthorized remittance transfers, unless the sender specifically indicates that it should apply only to the next scheduled remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, comment 36(c)-3 clarifies that a financial institution that is also a remittance transfer provider may have both stop payment obligations under § 1005.10 and cancellation obligations under § 1005.36. If a sender cancels a remittance transfer under § 1005.36 with a remittance transfer provider that holds the sender's account, and the transfer is a preauthorized transfer under § 1005.10, then the cancellation provisions of § 1005.36 exclusively apply. The Bureau notes that in these circumstances, a provider would not be permitted to require the sender to give written confirmation of a cancellation within 14 days of an oral notification, as is permitted for stop payment orders in § 1005.10(c)(2). The Bureau believes that a sender should be able to orally cancel any remittance transfer, including a remittance transfer that is scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, without the additional burden of providing written confirmation of the cancellation.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In the January 2012 Proposed Rule published elsewhere in today's <em data-original="E-04">Federal Register</em>, the Bureau is also soliciting comment on the cancellation period for a remittance transfer scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>36(c) Cancellation</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The February Final Rule contains cancellation requirements for remittance transfers. For most remittance transfers, § 1005.34(a) requires the remittance transfer provider to comply with a cancellation request received no later than 30 minutes after the sender makes payment for the remittance transfer if: (i) The sender's request allows the provider to identify the sender's name and address or telephone number and the specific transaction to be cancelled; and (ii) the transferred funds have not been picked up by the designated recipient or deposited into the recipient's account. For remittance transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, including preauthorized remittance transfers, § 1005.36(c) of the February Final Rule requires the remittance transfer provider to comply with a sender's request for cancellation if the request: (i) Enables the provider to identify the sender's name and address or telephone number and the particular transfer to be cancelled; and (ii) is received at least three business days before the scheduled date of the remittance transfer. Section 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) requires the provider to include a statement about the sender's cancellation rights, using the language set forth in Model Form A-37 of Appendix A to subpart B or substantially similar language.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is amending Regulation E in this final rule to, among other things, clarify the obligations of the remittance transfer provider for remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer and to provide senders with information to calculate the cancellation deadline for remittance transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer. As discussed above, the Bureau is making certain adjustments to the disclosure and timing requirements in other sections of the final rule in order to enhance senders' ability to properly determine the cancellation deadline for remittance transfers, to enable senders to more easily identify and track preauthorized remittance transfers that occur in close proximity to one another, and to facilitate industry compliance with the cancellation disclosure requirements.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the final rule adds § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii), which requires remittance transfer providers to disclose the date of transfer in certain receipts provided to senders pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(2). These requirements apply only to remittance transfers scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, as well as the initial transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers. As discussed below, § 1005.36(d)(2)(ii) also requires future transfer dates to be disclosed for subsequent transfers in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, for which payment is made by the sender four or fewer business days before the date of the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>However, as discussed below, the Bureau is retaining in § 1005.36(c) the requirement that a remittance transfer provider must comply with any oral or written request to cancel a remittance transfer if the request to cancel is received at least three business days before the scheduled date of the remittance transfer. The Bureau is also adopting a new § 1005.36(d) to require providers to disclose the future dates of transfer, cancellation requirements, and provider's contact information for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers no more than 12 months and no less than five business days before the date of the transfer. This timing requirement for these disclosures does not apply to subsequent transfers in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers for which payment is made by the sender four or fewer business days before the date of the transfer. For this subset of transfers, the information required by § 1005.36(d)(1), including future dates of transfer, must instead be included in the receipt for the first transfer in the series of preauthorized remittance transfers provided in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(1)(i). For subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers and transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of transfer, any receipt provided after the transfer is made in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) or (a)(2)(ii) must include the date of transfer (and cancellation requirements) for the transfer that is the subject of the receipt.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Three-Business-Day Deadline To Cancel</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As noted above, section 919(d)(3) of the EFTA provides the Bureau broad discretion to fashion cancellation requirements for remittance transfers. In the February Final Rule, the Bureau adopted in § 1005.36(c) specific cancellation requirements for remittance transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer. In adopting the three-business-day cancellation rule for such transfers, the Bureau explained that the general 30-minute cancellation period would not be appropriate for remittance transfers scheduled far in advance because it would permit only a short time for cancellation even though the remittance transfer might not occur for many days or even months. 77 FR 6194, 6268. Thus, the Bureau concluded that a three-business-day time period is more beneficial because it provides senders with more time to decide whether to go through with the transaction while giving remittance transfer providers sufficient time to process a cancellation request before the transaction is executed. <em data-original="E-03">Id.</em>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In the February Proposal, the Bureau explained that further consideration of the three-business-day cancellation rule and its application to remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer was necessary to ensure that the rule provided appropriate protection to senders without imposing an undue burden on providers. 77 FR 6310, 6321. Accordingly, the Bureau solicited comment on whether the three-business-day deadline to cancel advance transfers accomplishes these goals, or whether the deadline to cancel should be more or less than the three days adopted in the February Final Rule. The Bureau also solicited comment on whether it is important to maintain consistency between the cancellation deadline adopted for preauthorized remittances transfers in § 1005.36(c) and the cancellation deadline for preauthorized electronic fund transfers in § 1005.10(c)(1). 77 FR 6310, 6321. Finally, the Bureau solicited comment on whether the deadline to cancel would be easier to calculate if the cancellation period was based on calendar days instead of business days.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several commenters addressed the cancellation deadline for remittance transfers scheduled three or more business days in advance. Both industry and consumer group commenters generally agreed that the three-business-day time period for cancellation in the February Final Rule appropriately balances the interests of both parties to the transfer. One industry commenter opposed the three-business-day time period for cancellation; this commenter proposed as an alternative a five-day cancellation period, arguing that the Bureau should take into consideration providers' existing compliance obligations under other laws as well. Another industry commenter posited that, if the Bureau does not amend the definition of “remittance transfer provider” to exclude depository institutions executing certain types of international wire transfers, cancellation should be allowed only until a transfer has been executed by a depository institution. One industry commenter agreed that the Bureau should continue to require the deadline to cancel to be expressed in business days as opposed to calendar days.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Although most commenters expressed support for the three-business-day cancellation period, a few industry commenters conditioned their support on whether and to what extent remittance transfer providers may be required to disclose to senders the exchange rates that apply to transfers scheduled before the date of transfer. One industry commenter stated that the three-business-day cancellation period would be appropriate only if a remittance transfer provider were not required to disclose the actual exchange rates that would apply to preauthorized remittance transfers ten days before the dates of such transfers. The industry commenter, however, also agreed that senders should be able to cancel preauthorized remittance transfers or other remittance transfers scheduled to take place in the future, but that the cancellation requirements should be balanced with a shorter time period for exchange rate disclosure. Another industry commenter argued that the three-business-day cancellation requirement would present a substantial risk of loss to a remittance transfer provider if the provider were required to disclose the exchange rate that would apply to a remittance transfer more than one day before the scheduled date of transfer. This commenter suggested that the Bureau establish a bifurcated cancellation structure for transfers scheduled before the date of transfer under which: (i) the 30-minute cancellation period in § 1005.34(a) would apply for any transfer for which the provider discloses the actual exchange rate; and (ii) the three-business-day cancellation period established in § 1005.36(c) would apply for any transfer in which the provider discloses an estimated exchange rate.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau recognizes the concern expressed by a few industry commenters that remittance transfer providers may incur additional risk if the time period to cancel a transfer extends beyond the date upon which a remittance transfer provider must disclose the actual exchange rate that will apply to a remittance transfer. As the Bureau noted in the discussion regarding § 1005.32(b)(2)(i), whenever there are time lags between when the retail exchange rate that applies to a remittance transfer is set, when the relevant foreign currency is purchased, and when funds are delivered, a remittance transfer provider (and/or its business partner) may face losses due to unexpected changes in the value of the relevant foreign currency. The Bureau's decision in § 1005.32(b)(2) of the final rule to allow remittance transfer providers to provide an estimated exchange rate in certain disclosures for remittance transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer should help alleviate these concerns. (<em data-original="E-03">See</em> discussion above regarding § 1005.32(b)(2) for additional analysis of foreign exchange risks.) As a result, under the final rule, a remittance transfer provider will not be required to disclose, prior to the date of the transfer, an actual, as opposed to an estimated, exchange rate if the transfer is scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer. This five-business-day period is shorter than the more than ten day period proposed in the February Proposal and reduces the period during which a remittance transfer provider that permits transfers to be scheduled before the date of transfer may face additional foreign exchange risks due to the gap between the time the provider sets an exchange rate and the date of the transfer. And, while there is a short period outside the cancellation window in which the remittance transfer provider is required to disclose actual rather than estimated exchange rates, the Bureau believes that providers may be able to manage the foreign currency risks or may choose not to offer consumers the ability to schedule remittance transfers in this period. The Bureau does not believe the latter option presents a substantial risk of harm to senders, because it believes that any provider that generally permits consumers to schedule remittance transfers in advance will at least retain the option for consumers to schedule their transfers the day of or five or more business days before the date of the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, the Bureau concludes that the three-day-business cancellation period for remittance transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer as adopted in the February Final Rule is appropriate. The Bureau believes that cancellation rights are important because they allow senders time to review the disclosure for accuracy and cancel the transaction when warranted by a change in circumstances. In addition, the Bureau believes the three-business-day cancellation period strikes an appropriate balance between sender and remittance transfer provider interests. This time period is close enough to the transfer date so that senders will know if there are circumstances warranting a cancellation, while it gives providers an adequate amount of time to process a cancellation request. Finally, as the Bureau noted in the February Final Rule, the three-business-day cancellation period is consistent with the cancellation requirement for electronic fund transfers. 77 FR 6194, 6268. Since many remittance transfer providers also provide electronic fund transfers, maintaining similar regulatory regimes should minimize burden and facilitate compliance.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Disclosure of Cancellation Period in Pre-Payment Disclosures for Subsequent Preauthorized Remittance Transfers</title>
        <analysisParagraph>In the February Proposal, the Bureau solicited comment on whether a remittance transfer provider should be required to disclose the cancellation period in the pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent remittance transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, rather than in the receipt for each subsequent transfer. As the Bureau recognized in the February Proposal, this issue would be relevant only if the pre-payment disclosure requirement in § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) of the February Final Rule is retained in this rulemaking. 77 FR 6310, 6323.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau is revising the disclosure requirements for preauthorized remittance transfers to eliminate the requirement that remittance transfer providers provide a pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent transfer in series of preauthorized remittance transfers. Instead, the final rule requires that, in most circumstances, a receipt for each subsequent transfer be provided to the sender. Consequently, the Bureau's inquiry of whether the cancellation disclosure should be provided in the pre-payment disclosure or the receipt for each subsequent transfer is now generally moot. Since there generally is no longer a requirement to provide a pre-payment disclosure for subsequent transfers, the sender's cancellation rights must be disclosed on any receipt provided in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(2) and (d)(2) (<em data-original="E-03">see</em> discussion below), as applicable.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>36(a) Timing</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.36(a) sets forth the disclosure timing requirements for disclosures relating to preauthorized remittance transfers. Under § 1005.36(a)(1), for the first scheduled transfer, the provider is required to provide both the pre-payment disclosure described in § 1005.31(b)(1) and the receipt described in § 1005.31(b)(2) in accordance with the timing rules set forth in § 1005.31(e) that generally apply to remittance transfers. In effect, under the final rule, the first scheduled transfer of a preauthorized remittance transfer is treated the same as other individual transfer requests by a sender.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>However, under § 1005.36(a)(2), different timing requirements apply to disclosures relating to subsequent scheduled transfers. Under § 1005.36(a)(2)(i), the provider must mail or deliver a pre-payment disclosure, as described in § 1005.31(b)(1), within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of each subsequent transfer. If the general timing rule in § 1005.31(e) applied, the provider would be required to provide a pre-payment disclosure at the time the scheduled payments are authorized. By requiring a pre-payment disclosure at this alternative time for each subsequent transfer, senders will receive information about their transfers in closer proximity to the scheduled transfer date, and the provider should be in a better position to make the required disclosures. This approach also reminds senders about the pending transfer, which will enable them to confirm that sufficient funds are available for the transfer. In the January 2012 Proposed Rule published elsewhere in today's <em data-original="E-04">Federal Register</em>, the Bureau is also soliciting comment on a safe harbor with respect to the reasonable time requirement.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In addition, under § 1005.36(a)(2)(ii), the provider must provide the receipt described in § 1005.31(b)(2) for each subsequent transfer. As with pre-payment disclosures, the Bureau does not believe a receipt given at the time payment for the transfer is authorized would be as useful to senders as a receipt received closer in time to the actual transfer that contains more relevant information about the particular scheduled transfer. The final rule requires the receipt to be mailed or delivered to the sender no later than one business day after the date on which the transfer is made. However, if the transfer involves the transfer of funds from the sender's account held by the provider, the receipt may be provided on or with the next regularly scheduled periodic statement for that account or within 30 days after payment is made for the remittance transfer if a periodic statement is not provided. Section 1005.36(a)(2)(ii) closely tracks the receipt timing rule for receipts in transactions conducted entirely by telephone under § 1005.31(e)(2).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that these special timing rules for pre-payment disclosures and receipts for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers will result in more meaningful disclosures to senders than if providers were required to provide these disclosures at the time the transfers were authorized.</analysisParagraph>

In addition, as stated above, to facilitate compliance and further the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its exception authority under EFTA section 904(c) to revise § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) to eliminate the requirement to include non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider in the calculation of the amount received, disclosed on the receipt provided to the sender under § 1005.31(b)(2)(i), consistent with the narrowed scope of § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi).  As discussed above, to further the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau also believes that it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to require providers to include disclaimers stating, as applicable, that non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected by a person other than the provider may apply to the remittance transfer and result in the designated recipient receiving less than the amount disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii).  Accordingly, the Bureau is amending the cross-reference in § 1005.31(b)(2)(i) to require that such disclaimers be provided on the receipt.  These changes would also be reflected on a combined disclosure. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(b)(3).</analysisParagraph>

        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii)(D) would have required disclosure of the URL of the Web site of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and a telephone number a consumer can contact and the URL a consumer can visit to submit a complaint about a prepaid account. As discussed in the proposal and the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(2)(xii) above, the Bureau intends to develop resources on its Web site that would, among other things, provide basic information to consumers about prepaid accounts, the benefits and risks of using them, and how to use the prepaid account disclosures. The Bureau also believed that consumers would benefit from seeing on the long form disclosure the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Web site and telephone number that they can use to submit a complaint about a prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(2)(xii) above, a group advocating on behalf of business interests opposed disclosing contact information for the Bureau in both the short form and long form disclosures. The commenter suggested that disclosure in the long form of a Bureau Web site URL and telephone number through which consumers could submit complaints about prepaid cards would undermine the relationship between financial institutions and their customers. The commenter said consumers should be encouraged to raise issues about their prepaid cards directly with the financial institution rather than directing those issues to the Bureau. An issuing bank similarly opposed the proposed requirement to include in the long form contact information through which consumers could submit complaints about their prepaid accounts, saying that the statement casts prepaid cards in a negative light. The commenter instead supported disclosure of a neutral statement referring consumers to the Bureau for more information about prepaid products.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii)(D), renumbered as § 1005.18(b)(4)(vi), with certain modifications. Specifically, for clarity, the Bureau has added to the regulatory text the specific language for this statement. In addition, the Bureau made technical modifications to the rule for conformity and clarity.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Final § 1005.18(b)(4)(vi) requires inclusion in the long form of a statement directing the consumer to a Web site URL of the Bureau (<em data-original="E-03">cfpb.gov/prepaid</em>) for general information about prepaid accounts, and a statement directing the consumer to the Bureau telephone number (1-855-411-2372) and Web site URL (<em data-original="E-03">cfpb.gov/complaint</em>) to submit a complaint about a prepaid account, using the following clause or a substantially similar clause: “For general information about prepaid accounts, visit <em data-original="E-03">cfpb.gov/prepaid</em>. If you have a complaint about a prepaid account, call the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau at 1-855-411-2372 or visit <em data-original="E-03">cfpb.gov/complaint</em>.” In the final rule, the Bureau has added the word “general” to the statement that the Bureau Web site provides “general information” about prepaid accounts for parity with final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is not persuaded by industry commenters that it should not include these disclosure requirements in the final rule. In the same vein, regarding the long form disclosure of the telephone number and Web site URL for submitting a complaint, the Bureau believes it both logical and crucial to inform consumers of an available resource that can help them connect with financial institutions so their complaints about prepaid accounts can be heard and addressed. Indeed, the Bureau included a similar requirement in the Remittance Rule; there, remittance transfer providers must disclose the Bureau's contact information on the receipt provided in conjunction with a remittance transfer.<footnote ref="455">§ 1005.31(b)(2)(vi).</footnote>
             In the preamble to the final Remittance Rule, the Bureau explained that such a disclosure requirement was necessary to ensure consumer complaints about remittance transfer providers were centralized in one place.<footnote ref="456">77 FR 6194, 6229 (Feb. 7, 2012).</footnote>

      <title>31(a)(5) Disclosures for Mobile Application or Text Message Transactions</title>
      <analysisParagraph>In the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the Board noted that retainability and formatting requirements could pose challenges for providing disclosures in transactions conducted via mobile application or text message. As discussed above, many industry commenters argued that the Bureau should change or provide for tailored retainability or formatting requirements for transactions conducted via mobile application or text message to ensure that senders would continue to have access to these services. Several industry commenters noted that they offered or were developing technology to permit senders to send a remittance transfer via a mobile telephone. The commenters believed that such services were evolving rapidly and urged the Bureau to provide flexibility in the final rule.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, because remittance transfers sent via mobile application or text message on a telephone are “conducted entirely by telephone,” the Bureau believes that EFTA section 919(a)(5)(A) permits the Bureau to allow oral pre-payment disclosures in connection with transfers sent via mobile application or text message if the transfer is conducted entirely by telephone. Because oral disclosures are not retainable, the Bureau does not believe senders would be less protected by receiving pre-payment disclosures via mobile application or text message that is also not retainable. Moreover, in some cases, senders receiving disclosures via mobile application or text message may be informed of the cost of their transaction in a manner that is better than oral disclosures. For example, a disclosure provided by text message stored in a mobile telephone could be viewed by the sender for a period of time after the transaction is complete or forwarded to an email or other savable file.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to add in the final rule § 1005.31(a)(5), which states that the pre-payment disclosure may be provided orally or via mobile application or text message if: (i) The transaction is conducted entirely by telephone via mobile application or text message; (ii) the remittance transfer provider complies with the foreign language requirements of § 1005.31(g)(2); and (iii) the provider discloses orally or via mobile application or text message a statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) pursuant to the timing requirements in § 1005.31(e)(1). The final rule also adds comment 31(a)(5)-1 to illustrate how a provider could provide pre-payment disclosures for mobile application and text message transactions. The comment states that, for example, if a sender conducts a transaction via text message on a mobile telephone, the remittance transfer provider may call the sender and orally provide the required pre-payment disclosures. Alternatively, the provider may provide the required pre-payment disclosures via text message. The comment also clarifies that § 1005.31(a)(5) applies only to transactions conducted entirely by mobile telephone via mobile application or text message.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(b)(2)(xi) Statement Regarding Registration and FDIC or NCUA Insurance</title>
      <analysisParagraph>As described in detail below, the proposed rule would have required a statement in the short form disclosure communicating to consumers that a prepaid account must be registered in order for the funds to be protected. On the following line, the proposed rule would have required disclosure of a lack of FDIC or NCUSIF insurance. In the final rule, the Bureau has combined the registration and insurance disclosures and is requiring the financial institution to disclose whether or not the prepaid account program is eligible for FDIC or NCUA insurance.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal Requiring a Statement Regarding Registration of the Prepaid Account</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed that a statement regarding the importance of registering the prepaid account with the financial institution be included on the short form disclosure. Specifically, proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">12</em>) would have required a statement that communicates to a consumer that a prepaid account must be registered with a financial institution or service provider in order for the funds loaded onto the account to be protected, in a form substantially similar to the clauses set forth in proposed Model Forms A-10(a) through (d).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in part II.B above, registration typically means that a consumer provides identifying information such as name, address, date of birth, and Social Security Number or other government-issued identification number so that the financial institution can identify the cardholder and verify the cardholder's identity. The Bureau proposed to add this statement because many consumer protections set forth in the proposed rule would not take effect until a consumer registers an account. For example, under proposed § 1005.18(e)(3), a consumer would not have been entitled to error resolution rights or protection from unauthorized transactions until after registering the prepaid account. The Bureau believed that this is an important protection insofar as unregistered prepaid accounts are like cash—once lost, funds may be difficult or impossible to protect or replace because the financial institution may not know who the rightful cardholder is.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau, however, recognized that in some acquisition scenarios, for example, government benefit accounts, payroll card accounts, or cards used to disburse financial aid to students, this type of statement might be less useful because consumers must register with the government agency, employer, or institution of higher education, in order to acquire the account. The Bureau therefore specifically solicited comment on whether the short form disclosure provided to consumers pre-acquisition should always include this statement regarding registering the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal Requiring a Statement Regarding FDIC or NCUA Insurance</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also proposed to address pass-through deposit (and share) insurance in proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">13</em>). Specifically, proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">13</em>) would have required that if a prepaid account product is not set up to be eligible for FDIC deposit or NCUA share insurance, a financial institution would have to include a statement on the short form disclosure that FDIC deposit insurance or NCUA share insurance, as appropriate, does not protect funds loaded into the prepaid account, in a form substantially similar to the clause set forth in proposed Model Forms A-10(c) and (d).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in part II.B above, the FDIC, among other things, protects funds placed by depositors in insured banks and savings associations; the NCUA provides a similar role for funds placed in credit unions. As explained in the FDIC's 2008 General Counsel Opinion No. 8, the FDIC's deposit insurance coverage will “pass through” the custodian to the actual underlying owners of the deposits in the event of failure of an insured institution, provided certain specific criteria are met.<footnote ref="430">73 FR 67155, 67157 (Nov. 13, 2008).</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In response to the Prepaid ANPR, many consumer advocacy group commenters suggested that the Bureau require that pass-through deposit (or share) insurance cover all funds loaded into prepaid accounts, while many industry group commenters suggested that the Bureau propose clear disclosure of whether a prepaid product carries FDIC insurance or not. The Bureau believed it is not always easy to determine or explain whether FDIC or NCUSIF pass-through deposit or share insurance would apply to a particular prepaid account. Thus, the Bureau proposed that disclosure be made regarding FDIC or NCUSIF insurance in only limited situations.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In the Bureau's Study of Prepaid Account Agreements, the Bureau found that about two thirds of all account agreements reviewed stated that cardholder funds were protected by FDIC deposit (or NCUSIF share) insurance (this includes agreements that explained insurance coverage depends on card registration, or explained that it only applies to funds held by a bank or credit union in a pooled account associated with the program). The Bureau found that only about 11 percent of agreements explicitly stated that the program was not insured.<footnote ref="431">Of the remaining agreements, about 17 percent implied that the program was FDIC or NCUSIF insured by stating that the issuer is an FDIC- or NCUA-insured institution, but that did not address FDIC or NCUSIF insurance coverage for the program. A small number of agreements, 6 percent of those reviewed, did not address FDIC or NCUA insurance coverage for the program. For the latter two categories of programs, it is possible that such programs are in fact set up to be eligible for pass-through deposit (or share) insurance, but it was not possible to tell from reviewing the program's account agreement. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Study of Prepaid Account Agreements at 27-28 and tbl.13. In addition, the Bureau has observed that some GPR card providers disclose the existence of pass-through deposit insurance coverage or that the issuing bank is an FDIC-insured institution on their retail packaging, often quite prominently. The Bureau's Study of Prepaid Account Agreements, however, did not examine pass-through insurance statements made on GPR cards' retail packaging. Likewise, the Study did not examine pass-through insurance statements made on prepaid programs' other marketing materials or on their Web sites. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See id.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In its pre-proposal consumer testing, the Bureau observed that some participants misunderstood the scope of the protections FDIC pass-through deposit insurance actually provides for prepaid accounts. During the consumer focus groups, for example, nearly all participants said they had heard of FDIC deposit insurance, and many consumers believed the funds on their GPR cards were FDIC-insured.<footnote ref="432">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report I at 10.</footnote>
             When consumers were asked to explain what it meant that their GPR card had FDIC deposit insurance, most made vague references to their funds being “protected.” Upon further probing, however, the majority of participants incorrectly thought FDIC deposit insurance would protect their funds in the event of fraudulent charges or a stolen card.<footnote ref="433">The Bureau notes, however, that despite believing that FDIC insurance could “protect” funds held in a prepaid account, in its pre-proposal consumer testing no participants mentioned FDIC insurance when asked to interpret the statement “Register your card to protect your money,” which would have been disclosed pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;12&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report I at 5.</footnote>
             Very few participants understood FDIC insurance correctly in that it applies to the insolvency of the bank that holds the underlying funds and not to the funds on a prepaid card itself in the case of an unauthorized transaction on the account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In light of the results of the Bureau's Study of Prepaid Account Agreements indicating that many products meeting the proposed definition of prepaid account already provide pass-through deposit insurance coverage and consumers' misunderstandings about what protections pass-through deposit insurance actually affords, the Bureau decided not to propose any requirements related to the affirmative existence of pass-through deposit insurance. The Bureau did propose, however, that financial institutions would have to disclose a statement on the short form if a prepaid account is not set up to be eligible for FDIC (or NCUSIF) pass-through deposit (or share) insurance.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received Regarding the Statement Regarding Registration</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters, including an industry trade association, an issuing bank, a program manager, and the office of a State Attorney General generally supported the proposed statement regarding registration. The industry commenters also expressed concern, however, that the disclosure could mislead consumers because the statement implies that registration alone protects against fraud, rather than just providing a step toward FDIC insurance coverage and protections under Regulation E. The program manager recommended modifying the disclosure by combining the registration and insurance disclosures into one disclosure because, it said, registration is necessary for FDIC insurance coverage and a combined disclosure would be more accurate and less confusing to consumers. It also recommended stating that registration protects the consumer's “rights” rather than “money,” as a more accurate statement. The program manager recommended the following statement: “Register your card to be eligible for [FDIC/NCUSIF] insurance and to protect your rights.” The trade association and issuing bank recommended the following statement: “Register your card to protect your money.” <footnote ref="434">The trade association and the issuing bank also expressed concern that the proposed rule would have required disclosure of the name of the financial institution, when a vendor, such as a program manager, might actually carry out registration. The Bureau notes that the proposal would have permitted the name of whatever party carried out registration to be listed here, as the proposed rule would have required a statement that communicates to a consumer that a prepaid account must register with a financial institution &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;or servicer provider.&lt;/em&gt; The final rule does not require disclosure of this information, as discussed below.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters, including a trade association, a program manager, and two issuing banks also recommended eliminating the registration disclosure for certain types of prepaid account programs, including non-reloadable prepaid products, payroll card accounts, and government benefit accounts. One of the issuing banks and the program manager said the statement was not relevant for non-reloadable products because there is no customer identification or account registration process for such programs and, thus, the statement would be confusing to consumers. The remaining commenters said the registration requirement was not relevant for payroll card accounts and/or government benefit accounts because registration occurs prior to card issuance and because such accounts would be required to provide error resolution and limited liability protections regardless of registration. The program manager suggested that the space could be better used to disclose other information, such as how to access full wages without fees for payroll card accounts.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received Regarding the Statement Regarding FDIC or NCUA Insurance</title>
        <analysisParagraph>A number of industry commenters, including industry trade associations, issuing banks, and a credit union, and as well as several consumer groups commented on the proposed insurance disclosure (which, as discussed above, would have required disclosure only of the lack of insurance). Several industry trade associations and a credit union supported the Bureau's proposed disclosure requirement; one commenter noted that it is essential for consumers to know that they could lose their money if the financial institution were to fail. Most industry commenters, however, recommended that the Bureau require disclosure of both when pass-through deposit insurance is available and when it is not. One industry trade association and an issuing bank recommended requiring disclosure when a prepaid account program is not eligible for insurance coverage and permitting the issuer to decide whether to disclose when the program is eligible for insurance coverage. The credit union commenter recommended disclosure only when the program is eligible for insurance coverage.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Two consumer groups recommended more fulsome disclosure of insurance coverage. One recommended disclosure in the short form of the risks of uninsured deposits and, when the program is eligible for insurance coverage, the need to register for insurance to attach. The other consumer group recommended that the Bureau include a section in the long form disclosure which would provide fuller disclosure regarding the lack of insurance. (See a detailed discussion of this issue in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(4)(iii) below.) One of the consumer groups recommended requiring providers to inform consumers that registration of the prepaid account is required for deposit insurance to attach and protect funds.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Although the Bureau had not proposed to require financial institutions affirmatively to obtain deposit or share insurance, some commenters urged such a requirement. In particular, many consumer groups, individual consumers who submitted comments as part of a comment submission campaign organized by a national consumer advocacy group, and the offices of two State Attorneys General argued that disclosures are insufficient in this instance and requested that the Bureau require that prepaid account funds be held in custodial accounts that carry deposit insurance. Several commenters requested FDIC insurance for specific accounts, such as payroll card accounts and registered prepaid accounts. A few commenters argued that virtual payment accounts that offer the same features as prepaid cards should also be FDIC insured because the non-bank entities that offer such accounts might attempt to avoid the cost of insurance and the oversight of regulators by not storing funds at a depository institution.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>These commenters primarily argued that prepaid accounts increasingly serve as bank alternatives and therefore should have the same benefits as checking and savings accounts, especially because consumers expect this type of protection. Several commenters argued that accepting a consumer's core income and holding it in an uninsured account would be an unfair, deceptive or abusive act or practice; requiring FDIC insurance would not be unexpected or onerous and would eliminate unscrupulous providers that do not deposit funds with legitimate financial institutions; and not requiring FDIC insurance would cause prepaid accounts to be viewed as subpar financial products.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Conversely, one industry trade association advocated against requiring pass-through insurance for prepaid accounts, arguing that such a measure would put credit unions at a competitive disadvantage because of their field of membership restrictions.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">12</em>) and (<em data-original="E-03">13</em>), combined into renumbered § 1005.18(b)(2)(xi), with several substantial modifications as described below. First, the Bureau has combined the registration and insurance disclosures into a single line. Second, the Bureau is requiring disclosure both when a prepaid account program is eligible for FDIC or NCUA insurance coverage and when it is not. Third, the Bureau has added to the regulatory text the specific language that should be used to make this combined disclosure in five distinct circumstances. The Bureau is also adopting new comments 18(b)(2)(xi)-1 and -2 to provide additional guidance regarding this disclosure requirement. Finally, the Bureau has made technical modifications to the rule for conformity and clarity.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau continues to believe it is important that financial institutions disclose to consumers purchasing prepaid accounts both that registration and insurance coverage provide protection. Because certain protections do not attach until registration, such that unregistered prepaid accounts are akin in some ways to carrying cash, the Bureau believes it is important for consumers to be aware that they should register their accounts. As discussed below, the final rule links the act of registration with insurance coverage and other protections. The Bureau believes that, even absent a consumer's full understanding of the protections afforded by registration, linking registration to insurance coverage and other protections will help motivate consumers to register their prepaid accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Similarly, the Bureau believes it is important to disclose to consumers information about insurance coverage. While the Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing confirmed that some consumers erroneously equate FDIC coverage with fraud or theft protection, a number of participants understood that the insurance protects consumers' funds in the case of bank insolvency.<footnote ref="435">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report II at 15 and 26. In the first round of the Bureau's post-proposal consumer testing, two out of nine participants understood that FDIC insurance is meant to protect their money in case of a bank failure; in the second round, approximately half of the 11 participants understood this.</footnote>
             Regardless of their understanding of what FDIC insurance actually protects against, most participants identified insurance coverage as positive and wanted to know whether the prepaid card they were considering buying in the testing scenario offered this protection. The Bureau understands that the attachment of pass-through FDIC deposit or NCUA share insurance can be a complex matter determined by many factors, including how the financial institution has structured the program and the accuracy of its recordkeeping. The Bureau believes that, even absent a full understanding of the attachment requirements and the protections afforded by insurance coverage, disclosing whether a prepaid account program provides insurance coverage will educate consumers and a combined insurance and registration disclosure will help motivate consumers to register their prepaid accounts, when applicable.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is persuaded by commenters, the results of its post-proposal consumer testing, and information received during the interagency consultation process that the registration and insurance disclosures should be combined, and that both the existence as well as the lack of insurance eligibility should be disclosed. First, registration is a prerequisite to insurance protection; the two processes are conceptually linked and the Bureau believes that disclosing them together will help consumers appreciate this cause and effect. Also, while under the proposed rule registration would have been a prerequisite to certain Regulation E protections, the final rule expands error resolution and limited liability protections for unregistered consumers, thereby reducing the urgency to emphasize registration in its own dedicated line in the short form disclosure. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> final § 1005.18(e). Moreover, the additional space in the short form created by combining these disclosures has allowed the Bureau to permit the addition of other information to the form while remaining in keeping with the size constraints of existing J-hook packaging. <em data-original="E-03">See, e.g.,</em> final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B) and (3)(ii). The Bureau believes that melding these two disclosures into a single line will provide more rational and efficient information to consumers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Second, the Bureau believes that disclosure of both the existence or lack of insurance eligibility will be more beneficial to consumers than disclosing only when insurance is not available. Consistent with the position of many commenters, the Bureau found in its post-proposal consumer testing that, while participants understood the meaning of statements regarding coverage and non-coverage, when the prototype short form was silent (as it would be under the proposed rule if the prepaid account program was eligible for insurance coverage) most participants did not understand that to mean insurance was offered.<footnote ref="436">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report II at 15 and 25-26.</footnote>
             The Bureau was thus concerned that the proposed model forms' silence when a program is eligible for insurance coverage would not be effective in communicating to consumers that a prepaid account program is eligible for insurance coverage.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The final rule refers to NCUA, rather than NCUSIF, insurance for credit unions. After further consideration and based on information received during the interagency consultation process, the Bureau believes the term “NCUA” may be more meaningful to consumers than “NCUSIF” and has revised the disclosures accordingly in both final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xi) and (4)(iii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In response to concerns raised by commenters, the Bureau has tailored the final rule to take into account the existence and timing of a financial institution's consumer identification and verification process. For some types of prepaid account programs, such as payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts, financial institutions conduct customer identification and verification before the card is distributed or activated, while others, such as certain non-reloadable cards, may have no customer identification and verification process at all. As noted above, the Bureau has added to the regulatory text of the final rule specific language that financial institutions should use to make the disclosure for clarity. The tailored language required under the final rule accounts for these distinctions.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Specifically, the final rule covers five different scenarios:</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>• Final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xi)(A) requires that, if a prepaid account program is set up to be eligible for FDIC deposit or NCUA share insurance, and customer identification and verification does not occur before the account is opened, the financial institution make this disclosure using the following clause or a substantially similar clause: “Register your card for [FDIC insurance eligibility] [NCUA insurance, if eligible] and other protections.”</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>• Final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xi)(B) requires that, if a prepaid account program is not set up to be eligible for FDIC deposit or NCUA share insurance, and customer identification and verification does not occur before the account is opened, the financial institution make this disclosure using the following clause or a substantially similar clause: “Not [FDIC] [NCUA] insured. Register your card for other protections.”</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>• Final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xi)(C) requires that, if a prepaid account program is set up to be eligible for FDIC deposit or NCUA share insurance, and customer identification and verification occurs for all prepaid accounts within the prepaid program before the account is opened, the financial institution make this disclosure using the following clause or a substantially similar clause: “Your funds are [eligible for FDIC insurance] [NCUA insured, if eligible].”</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>• Final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xi)(D) requires that, if a prepaid account program is not set up to be eligible for FDIC deposit or NCUA share insurance, and customer identification and verification occurs for all prepaid accounts within the prepaid account program before the account is opened, the financial institution make this disclosure using the following clause or a substantially similar clause: “Your funds are not [FDIC] [NCUA] insured.”</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>• Finally, final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xi)(E) requires that, if a prepaid account program is set up such that there is no customer identification and verification process for any prepaid accounts within the prepaid account program, the financial institution make this disclosure using the following clause or a substantially similar clause: “Treat this card like cash. Not [FDIC] [NCUA] insured.”</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau had specifically requested comment as to whether non-banks that issue prepaid accounts could apply the proposed statement regarding FDIC or NCUA insurance to their products, or whether the Bureau should propose an alternative requirement regarding the disclosure of the availability of FDIC or NCUA insurance for non-banks that issue prepaid accounts. The Bureau did not receive any comments in response to this request. The Bureau believes that it nonetheless would be useful to provide additional guidance as to when the disclosure should refer to NCUA insurance coverage and when it should instead refer to FDIC insurance coverage. Thus, new comment 18(b)(2)(xi)-1 clarifies when to use the term “FDIC” and when to use “NCUA.” Specifically, the comment explains that if the consumer's prepaid account funds are held at a credit union, the disclosure must indicate NCUA insurance eligibility. The comment goes on to say that if the consumer's prepaid account funds are held at a financial institution other than a credit union, the disclosure must indicate FDIC insurance eligibility. As a result of requests received during the interagency consultation process, the disclosures of both FDIC and NCUA insurance pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(xi) expressly reflect eligibility in the statement, to put consumers acquiring prepaid accounts on notice that insurance protections may not attach in all cases. This includes, for example, when the consumer is not a member of the issuing credit union with respect to NCUA.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 18(b)(2)(xi)-2 addresses certain aspects of customer identification and verification. Specifically, the comment cross-references final § 1005.18(e)(3) and comments 18(e)-4 and -5 for additional guidance on the timing of customer identification and verification processes, and on prepaid account programs for which there is no customer identification and verification process for any prepaid accounts within the prepaid account program.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau considered adding additional information to the registration and insurance disclosure in the short form, as requested by one commenter, such as an explanation of what protections in addition to insurance eligibility registration provides or more fulsome information about the implications of insurance coverage. However, in light of overall space constraints and the multiple goals for the short form, the Bureau ultimately decided against adding any more information to the registration/insurance disclosure. The Bureau believes this disclosure balances the most important information for consumers with the brevity and clarity necessary for optimal consumer comprehension of the short form disclosure. The Bureau is, however, requiring financial institutions to provide more detailed information about insurance coverage in the long form disclosure. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> final § 1005.18(b)(4)(iii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In light of the results of the Bureau's Study of Prepaid Account Agreements indicating that many products meeting the proposed definition of prepaid account already provide pass-through deposit insurance coverage, consumers' misunderstandings about what protections pass-through deposit insurance actually affords, and the complexities inherent in ensuring pass-through insurance coverage, the Bureau is not including a requirement mandating FDIC or NCUA insurance coverage at this time.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1005.18 Requirements for Financial Institutions Offering Prepaid Accounts</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Currently, § 1005.18 contains provisions specific to payroll card accounts. Because payroll card accounts would be largely subsumed into the proposed definition of prepaid account, the Bureau proposed to revise § 1005.18 by replacing it with provisions governing prepaid accounts, which the Bureau proposed to apply to payroll card accounts as well. Each of the provisions of § 1005.18 is discussed in turn below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Regarding the Bureau's proposed approach to § 1005.18, several commenters, including industry trade associations, program managers, and issuing banks, argued that payroll card accounts should not be treated the same as other prepaid accounts, because they are already heavily regulated by State laws, and, unlike prepaid accounts sold at retail, are not distributed or marketed to the general public. These commenters thus urged the Bureau to finalize the provisions related to payroll card accounts specifically in a separate section, rather than to subsume those provisions into proposed § 1005.18. They argued that maintaining two separate sections would ease compliance and provide regulatory clarity and certainty for issuers and employers. One issuing bank, however, took the opposite position, arguing that there was no reason to treat payroll card accounts distinctly from other prepaid accounts.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail in the <em data-original="E-03">Overview of the Bureau's Approach to Regulation E</em> section and the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(A) above, the Bureau believes that there is substantial value to both consumers and financial institutions in promoting consistent treatment across products. In addition, the Bureau believes that, to the extent many GPR cards already comply with existing regulations for payroll card accounts, financial institutions already treat payroll card accounts and GPR cards similarly. Similarly, the Bureau believes that maintaining the current numbering system that financial institutions already complying with Regulation E have come to rely on— <em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> keeping provisions related to government benefit accounts in § 1005.15 and provisions related to payroll card accounts in § 1005.18—will enhance compliance by preventing unnecessary confusion. Thus, although there are several provisions in final § 1005.18 that distinguish payroll card accounts (and government benefit accounts) from other types of prepaid accounts, the Bureau believes it is appropriate to subsume the requirements for payroll card accounts into the requirements for prepaid accounts generally in final § 1005.18. The Bureau is finalizing § 1005.15 separately for government benefit accounts, however, because of the unique complexities surrounding who constitutes a financial institution for purposes of that section (and Regulation E generally) with respect to government benefit accounts.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>31(b)(1)(vi) Fees and Taxes Imposed by a Person Other Than the Provider</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(b)(1)(vi) stated that a remittance transfer provider must disclose any fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, in the currency in which the funds will be received by the designated recipient. Such fees and taxes could include lifting fees charged in connection with an international wire transfer, a fee charged by a recipient institution or agent, or a tax imposed by a government in the designated recipient's country. Because such fees and taxes affect the amount ultimately received by the designated recipient, the Board proposed the disclosure of other fees and taxes to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters supported the disclosure of third party fees and taxes to senders of remittance transfers, stating that such a disclosure would be consistent with the language and purpose of the statute, and would best inform the sender of the amount the recipient would ultimately receive. In contrast, industry commenters opposed the disclosure. Most industry commenters argued that compliance with the proposed disclosure requirement would be burdensome, if not impossible. Commenters stated that financial institutions sending wire transfers and international ACH transactions only have control over the delivery to the next institution, and in some cases do not have a relationship with all of the subsequent intermediary institutions involved in a transfer or with the recipient institution. The originating institution may, in some cases, know the routing, but in other cases have no legal or technological means to control routing of a transaction once the transfer has been initiated and, therefore, it cannot know what institutions might be imposing fees or taxes on the remittance transfer. One industry commenter suggested that providing the disclosures may be possible for repeat wire transfers, because fee and tax information is known from the previous transfers, but not for new wire transfers.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters and a Federal Reserve Bank commenter argued that third party fees and taxes may not be known at the time of the transaction, which could result in the remittance transfer provider providing misleading information to the sender. Industry commenters also argued that smaller institutions do not have the resources to obtain or monitor information about foreign tax laws or fees charged by unrelated financial institutions that may be involved in the transfer. Some commenters noted that intermediary financial institutions, both inside and outside of the United States, are not required to disclose their fees. Moreover, some industry commenters argued, the sharing of fee information among financial institutions could violate privacy and competition laws. Industry commenters stated that no comprehensive information is available regarding foreign tax laws. Because an institution may not have resources to track tax laws in every foreign country to which it sends a remittance transfer, the commenters argued that some providers would limit the locations to which they send remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Further, some industry commenters noted that a recipient may enter into an agreement with a recipient institution that permits the institution to impose fees for an international payment received by the institution and applied to the recipient's account. The commenters stated that remittance transfer providers would not know whether the recipient has agreed to pay such fees or how much the recipient may have agreed to pay. The commenters argued that such fees charged to a recipient by a third party pursuant to an agreement between the recipient and a third party should not be required to be disclosed.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Some industry commenters argued that the statute did not intend for third party fees and taxes to be included in the disclosure of the total amount that will be received by the designated recipient. For example, one industry commenter argued that the statute only intended to include in the calculation of the amount of currency to be received the elements specifically required to be disclosed under EFTA section 919(a)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii) (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the amount of transfer fees and any other fees charged by the remittance transfer provider, and any exchange rate to be used by the remittance transfer provider for the remittance transfer). Another industry commenter argued that State laws that require a remittance transfer provider to disclose to a sender the total amount to be received by the designated recipient do not require disclosure of third party fees and taxes that may be imposed on the remittance transfer. Instead, the commenters argued, State laws only require the remittance transfer provider to disclose the amount of currency to be received after application of the exchange rate. Therefore, the commenters stated that fees or taxes set by a party other than the remittance transfer provider are not required to be included in the disclosure of the total amount received and, therefore, should not be required to be disclosed separately.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Overall, many industry commenters stated that the proposed disclosure requirements would cause financial institutions to withdraw from the market or restrict the locations to which wire transfers will be sent. The commenters also stated that the proposed requirements would increase costs to senders, and some argued that the proposed requirements would delay transactions while financial institutions determined the required information in order to make disclosures. Some industry commenters argued that the requirements put financial institutions at a competitive disadvantage compared to money transmitters, which, they argued, are typically able to know the required disclosures due to their closed network structure. Further, they argued that the proposed requirements could deter foreign financial institutions from agreeing to process U.S.-originated remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Generally, industry commenters urged the Bureau to exempt financial institutions that provide remittance transfers through correspondent relationships from the requirement to disclose third party fees or require different disclosures for these types of transactions. Industry commenters and a Federal Reserve Bank commenter also suggested that the final rule should incorporate a good faith standard with respect to these fee and tax disclosures. Some industry commenters further argued that the Bureau should not require foreign taxes to be provided, regardless of whether a remittance transfer was sent through a correspondent relationship. Industry commenters alternatively suggested that the Bureau only require a disclosure that the amount received may be subject to foreign taxes. A Federal Reserve Bank commenter suggested that the Bureau should provide a safe harbor for the foreign tax disclosure for providers that disclosed current or historical information available to the provider through reasonable efforts.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Commenters also suggested that the Bureau assist industry with determining unknown fees and taxes, particularly to help ease the disclosure burden on small providers. One industry commenter believed the Bureau should require correspondent institutions to publish the fees and taxes that are charged. Industry and consumer group commenters suggested that the Bureau should maintain a resource that provides relevant foreign taxes.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the introduction above, the Bureau recognizes the challenges for remittance transfer providers to determining fees and taxes imposed by third parties. However, the plain language of the statute requires disclosure of the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient. The Bureau believes this requires remittance transfer providers to determine the costs specifically related to the remittance transfer that may reduce the amount received by the designated recipient. Congress specifically recognized that these determinations would be difficult with regard to open network transactions by financial institutions and tailored a specific accommodation to allow use of reasonably accurate estimates for an interim period until financial institutions can develop methods to determine exact disclosures, such as fees and taxes charged by third parties.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>This disclosure provides consumer benefits by making senders aware of the impact of these fees and taxes, which is essential to fulfill the purpose of the statute. Providing a total to recipient that reflects the impact of third party fees and taxes, and separately disclosing those fees and taxes, will provide senders with a greater transparency regarding the cost of a remittance transfer. For many senders and recipients, disclosure of the amount of third party fees and taxes that may be deducted could be crucial to knowing whether the amount transferred will be sufficient to pay important household expenses and other bills. Senders also need to know the amount of such fees and taxes to determine whether to use the same provider for any future transfers. Without such information, it would be difficult for a sender to determine the costs of the transfer that would enable the sender to choose the most cost-effective method of sending remittance transfers. Moreover, as discussed below, the cost of third party taxes may vary depending on the types of institutions involved in the transmittal route, and disclosure of these taxes will assist senders comparing costs between providers. While the Bureau understands that tax information may not be readily available to a provider, the provider is in the best position to obtain the information to comply with the disclosure requirements. Because a provider will be engaged in sending remittance transfers to certain countries and, in some cases, will have relationships with entities in those countries, the Bureau believes the provider itself is in the best position to determine foreign tax information.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to require in § 1005.31(b)(vi) of the final rule the disclosure of any fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, using the terms “Other Fees” for fees and “Other Taxes” for taxes, or substantially similar terms.<footnote ref="76">Due to a scrivener's error, § 205.31(b)(vi) in the proposed rule had stated that these fees and taxes must be disclosed using the term “Other &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Transfer&lt;/em&gt; Fees,” “Other &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Transfer&lt;/em&gt; Taxes,” or “Other &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Transfer&lt;/em&gt; Fees and Taxes,” or a substantially similar term (emphasis added). The model forms as proposed, however, used the term “Other Fees and Taxes.” The terms set forth in § 1005.31(b)(vi) are adopted without the word “transfer” in order to more concisely describe the fees and taxes required to be disclosed in § 1005.31(b)(vi). The terms used in the final rule conform to the language used in the model forms, which participants in consumer testing generally understood to mean fees and taxes charged by a person other than the provider.</footnote>
             As discussed above, fees and taxes must be disclosed separately from one another in order to show which costs are fixed and which costs are variable. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 31(b)(1)-1.i. As discussed above, the Bureau believes that the rounded exchange rate required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) is not intended to constrain the number of decimal places involved in calculating other disclosures. Therefore, § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) adds the clarification that the exchange rate used to calculate the fees and taxes in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) is the exchange rate in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by § 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate. As discussed above, comment 31(b)(1)-3 provides examples to demonstrate the exchange rate that must be used to calculate the fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As noted above, proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii. distinguished between the fees and taxes imposed by the provider, discussed above in § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii), and the fees and taxes imposed by a person other than the provider. The proposed comment provided examples of each of these types of fees and taxes. Proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii. also clarified that the terms used to describe each of these types of fees and taxes must differentiate between such fees and taxes and provided an example to illustrate this differentiation.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters requested clarification regarding the types of fees imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider. For example, an industry commenter and a Federal Reserve Bank commenter asked the Bureau to clarify that these fees and taxes do not include fees and taxes that banks and other parties charge one another for handling a remittance transfer, so long as the fees do not affect the amount of the transfer. Another industry commenter asked whether funds deducted from the amount received in a remittance transfer by a recipient institution exercising its rights of set-off would be required to be disclosed as a fee to a sender.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii. of the final rule clarifies that the fees and taxes required to be disclosed include only those that are charged to the sender or designated recipient and are specifically related to the remittance transfer. The Bureau does not believe that any fee or tax is required to be disclosed solely because it is charged at the same time that a remittance transfer is sent, because such fees and taxes are not necessarily “imposed on the remittance transfer.” For example, an overdraft fee charged by a bank at the same time that a remittance transfer is sent or received in an account is not imposed on the remittance transfer. In order to further clarify what charges should be disclosed to senders, the comment in the final rule provides examples of the types of fees that are not required to be disclosed under this provision, in addition to the examples of the types of fees that should be included that were included in the May 2011 Proposed Rule.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Specifically, comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii. states that the fees and taxes required to be disclosed by § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) include all fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider. For example, a provider must disclose a service fee and any State taxes imposed on the remittance transfer. In contrast, the fees and taxes required to be disclosed by § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) include fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider. Fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider include only those fees and taxes that are charged to the sender or designated recipient and are specifically related to the remittance transfer. For example, a provider must disclose fees imposed on a remittance transfer by the receiving institution or agent at pick-up for receiving the transfer, fees imposed on a remittance transfer by intermediary institutions in connection with an international wire transfer, and taxes imposed on a remittance transfer by a foreign government.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>However, the comment states that a provider need not disclose, for example, overdraft fees that are imposed by a recipient's bank or funds that are garnished from the proceeds of a remittance transfer to satisfy an unrelated debt, because these charges are not specifically related to the remittance transfer. Similarly, fees that banks charge one another for handling a remittance transfer or other fees that do not affect the total amount of the transaction or the amount that will be received by the designated recipient are not charged to the sender or designated recipient. For example, an interchange fee that is charged to a provider when a sender uses a credit or debit card to pay for a remittance transfer need not be disclosed. The comment also clarifies that the terms used to describe the fees or taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider in § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) and imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) must differentiate between such fees and taxes. For example, the terms used to describe fees disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) and (vi) may not both be described solely as “Fees.”</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-1 clarified how a provider must disclose fees and taxes in the currency in which funds will be received. Industry commenters expressed concern that a remittance transfer provider may not know the currency in which the funds will be received. As discussed above in comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-1, if a provider does not have specific knowledge regarding the currency in which the funds will be received, the provider may rely on a sender's representations as to the currency in which funds will be received.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-1 is adopted substantially as proposed, with an added clarification regarding reliance on a sender's representation regarding the currency in which the funds will be received. The Bureau is also revising the comment to reflect the clarification that disclosures that require an exchange rate to be applied should use the exchange rate in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by § 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-1 states that § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) requires the disclosure of fees and taxes in the currency in which the funds will be received by the designated recipient. A fee or tax described in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) may be imposed in one currency, but the funds may be received by the designated recipient in another currency. In such cases, the remittance transfer provider must calculate the fee or tax to be disclosed using the exchange rate in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by § 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate. For example, an intermediary institution in an international wire transfer may impose a fee in U.S. dollars, but funds are ultimately deposited in the recipient's account in Euros. In this case, the provider would disclose the fee to the sender expressed in Euros, calculated using the exchange rate used by the provider for the remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The comment further states that for purposes of § 1005.31(b)(1)(v), (vi), and (vii), if a provider does not have specific knowledge regarding the currency in which the funds will be received, the provider may rely on a sender's representation as to the currency in which funds will be received. For example, if a sender requests that a remittance transfer be deposited into an account in U.S. dollars, the provider may provide the disclosures required in § 1005.31(b)(1)(v), (vi), and (vii) in U.S. dollars, even if the account is denominated in Mexican pesos and the funds are subsequently converted prior to deposit into the account. If a sender does not know the currency in which funds will be received, the provider may assume that the currency in which funds will be received is the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The final rule also adds a new comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-2 to address situations where the information needed to determine the foreign taxes that apply to a transaction is not known to the provider and not publically available. Some industry commenters stated that foreign taxes may depend on variables other than the country to which the remittance transfer is sent, such as by the specific tax status of the sender and receiver, account type, or type of financial institution. The commenters stated that a sender may not be aware of the information needed to determine the tax obligation that applies to the transaction.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that when these types of variables affect the foreign taxes that apply to the transaction, providers may have to rely on representations made by the sender. If the sender does not know the information, and the provider does not otherwise have specific knowledge of the information, the Bureau believes it is necessary to provide a reasonable mechanism by which the provider may disclose the foreign tax. The Bureau believes it is appropriate in these instances to disclose the highest tax that could be imposed with respect to a particular variable, so the sender is not surprised that the amount received is reduced by more taxes than what is disclosed.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-2 states that the amount of taxes imposed by a person other than the provider may depend on the tax status of the sender or recipient, the type of accounts or financial institutions involved in the transfer, or other variables. For example, the amount of tax may depend on whether the receiver is a resident of the country in which the funds are received or the type of account to which the funds are delivered. If a provider does not have specific knowledge regarding variables that affect the amount of taxes imposed by a person other than the provider for purposes of determining these taxes, the provider may rely on a sender's representations regarding these variables, pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). If a sender does not know the information relating to the variables that affect the amount of taxes imposed by a person other than the provider, the provider may disclose the highest possible tax that could be imposed for the remittance transfer with respect to any unknown variable.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that if a provider does not independently have specific knowledge regarding variables that affect the amount of taxes imposed by a person other than the provider, the provider may rely on the sender's representations regarding these variables. For example, the rule does not impose on providers a duty to inquire about this information with a third party. The Bureau also notes that a provider may continue to rely on the sender's representations in any subsequent remittance transfers, unless the provider has specific knowledge that information relating to such variables has changed.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>31(b)(1)(vi) Covered Third-Party Fees </title>
      <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) of the 2012 Final Rule requires remittance transfer providers to disclose any fees and taxes imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, in the currency in which the funds will be received by the designated recipient.  As discussed above, the Bureau is refining the 2012 Final Rule with respect to the disclosure of certain recipient institution fees and foreign taxes.  The rationale for these changes is discussed below. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Disclosure of Recipient Institution Fees</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Since the Board first proposed to amend Regulation E to implement the Dodd-Frank Act's remittance transfer provisions, industry participants and representatives have argued that particularly for remittance transfers that take place over an open network, the requirement to disclose third-party fees is unduly burdensome, if not impossible, given the potential number of institutions involved in any one transfer and the fact that remittance transfer providers typically have no direct relationships with recipient institutions.  In issuing the February Final Rule, the Bureau recognized the challenges for providers in disclosing fees imposed by third parties, but determined that the disclosure of third-party fees would provide senders with greater transparency regarding the cost of a remittance transfer consistent with the purposes of the EFTA. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consequently, § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) of the 2012 Final Rule required providers to disclose fees imposed by persons other than the provider (including fees imposed by the designated recipient's institution) and required that such fees be taken into account when calculating the disclosure of the amount to be received under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii).  In view of Congress' recognition that these determinations would be difficult in the context of open network transactions by financial institutions, <em data-original="E-03">see</em> EFTA section 919(a)(4), § 1005.32(a) permitted insured institutions to estimate the amounts required to be disclosed pursuant to §§ 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) and (vii) for an interim period when such transfers are sent from a sender's account with the institution and the remittance transfer cannot determine the exact amounts for reasons beyond its control. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As noted above, after the Bureau published the February Final Rule, industry participants and representatives continued to express concern through comment letters and other fora that, where a designated recipient's institution charges the recipient fees for receiving a transfer in an account, the remittance transfer provider would not reasonably know, or be able to estimate, the amount of fees that might apply because fees might vary based on agreements between the recipient and the recipient institution.  Relatedly, industry participants and representatives requested clarification on whether and how to disclose recipient institution fees that can vary based on the recipient's status with the institution, the account type, the quantity of transfers received, or other variables that are not easily knowable by the sender or the provider. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In response to these concerns, in the December Proposal, the Bureau proposed to provide clarification relating to which recipient institution fees remittance transfer providers were required to disclose and additional flexibility and guidance on how recipient institution fees could be disclosed.  Proposed comment 31(b)(1)-1.ii would have provided additional examples to distinguish between fees that are specifically related to the remittance transfer and therefore required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), including fees that are imposed by a recipient's institution for receiving a wire transfer, and other types of recipient institution fees that are not specifically related to a remittance transfer, such as a monthly maintenance fee, and therefore not required to be disclosed.  For example, the proposed comment would have noted that fees that specifically relate to a remittance transfer may be structured on a flat per-transaction basis, or may be conditioned on other factors (such as account status or the quantity of remittance transfers received) in addition to the remittance transfer itself.  Moreover, similar to the treatment of taxes imposed by a person other than the remittance transfer provider under the 2012 Final Rule, the Bureau proposed to add comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-4 to clarify that a provider could rely on a sender's representation regarding variables that affect the amount of fees imposed by the recipient's institution for receiving a transfer in an account where the provider did not have specific knowledge regarding such variables.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Additionally, the December Proposal proposed to allow all remittance transfer providers, not just insured institutions covered by the temporary exception, the flexibility to estimate on a permanent basis certain fees imposed by a designated recipient's institution for receiving a transfer into an account.  Specially, where a provider did not have specific knowledge regarding variables that affect the amount of fees imposed by a designated recipient's institution for receiving a transfer in an account, proposed § 1005.32(b)(4)(i) would have permitted a provider to disclose the highest possible recipient institution fees that could be imposed on the remittance transfer with respect to any unknown variable, as determined based on either the recipient institution's fee schedules or information ascertained from prior transfers to that same institution. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The December Proposal additionally provided in proposed § 1005.32(b)(4)(ii) and its accompanying commentary that, if the remittance transfer provider could not obtain such fee schedules or did not have such information, the provider could rely on other reasonable sources of information, including fee schedules published by competitor institutions, surveys of financial institution fees, or information provided by the recipient institution's regulator or central bank as long as the provider disclosed the highest fees identified through the relied-upon source.  The Bureau sought comment on all aspects of this proposal.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Although most industry commenters stated that they supported the Bureau's efforts to provide additional flexibility to remittance transfer providers to determine applicable recipient institution fees, many industry commenters argued that the December Proposal would not significantly reduce the burden of disclosing recipient institution fees that are not already known. Describing providers' efforts to come into compliance with the 2012 Final Rule, industry commenters stated that efforts to obtain fee information had largely been hampered by the difficulty of obtaining information from recipient institutions with whom providers had no direct relationship, particularly in cases in which fees were governed by contracts between recipient institutions and recipients, <em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> those institutions' customers.  In additional outreach by the Bureau, one large bank provider and correspondent reported that it had attempted to survey recipient institutions with which it had regular contact, but that the vast majority of institutions had either not provided the requested fee information or failed to respond altogether.  In comment letters, as well as outreach both before and after the publication of the December Proposal, industry participants stated that they had difficulty explaining to foreign institutions what was being requested and why the foreign institutions should provide that information.  Industry participants further stated that recipient institutions declined to provide the requested fee information, citing proprietary, competitive, and privacy concerns associated with releasing information about their fee schedules and their contractual relationships with their customers. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Some industry participants stated that as a result of the difficulty in obtaining fee information from individual institutions, even with the flexibility that the December Proposal would have allowed, they anticipated that the challenges associated with obtaining fee schedules or conducting fee surveys might force them to limit services to countries where fee information was more readily obtainable or where the transfer volume was significant enough to warrant additional efforts to obtain fee information.  Though the pertinent comment letters focused on the December Proposal, the arguments echoed concerns that industry participants had previously expressed prior to the 2012 Final Rule with regard to any requirement to disclose fees imposed by persons other than the remittance transfer provider.  Industry commenters further opined more generally, as they had prior to the 2012 Final Rule, that a significant number of providers might choose to exit the market altogether, even if the Bureau were to adopt the December Proposal, due to the difficulty of disclosing recipient institution fees. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, several industry commenters stated that compared to the 2012 Final Rule, the proposed estimation methodologies would not improve and instead could diminish the quality of the disclosures received by senders or senders' ability to comparison shop.  With respect to the Bureau's proposal to add commentary clarifying that remittance transfer providers could rely in certain circumstances on senders' representations regarding the variables that affect the amount of fees to be imposed by a recipient's financial institution (<em data-original="E-03">see</em> proposed § 1005.32(b)(4)), several industry commenters argued that if the sender knew the fees that applied to the recipient's account, then it is likely the sender was getting such information from the recipient, and in such cases the disclosure of recipient institution fees would not provide additional transparency to the sender.  By contrast, to the extent that the sender had not received information on the variables that affect fees from the designated recipient, industry commenters argued that relying on a sender's representation would be unlikely to provide reliable information.  Industry commenters repeated industry's longstanding assertion that recipients are in the best position to know what fees their institutions impose on receiving transfers, and suggested that the Bureau reconsider its decision to mandate disclosure of such fees or provide a database of fees upon which providers could rely.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters also expressed concern with respect to the Bureau's proposal to allow remittance transfer providers to disclose an estimate of the highest possible recipient institution fee that could be imposed on the remittance transfer with respect to any unknown variable (<em data-original="E-03">see</em> proposed § 1005.32(b)(4)), as determined based on either fee schedules made available by the recipient institution or information ascertained from prior transfers to the same recipient institution.  Commenters stated that if each provider employed its own methodology based on its own research, the highest possible fee estimates would vary, sometimes widely, across institutions.  Commenters argued that this could cause consumer confusion and undermine comparison shopping, as senders would have little insight into which estimation model was accurate.  Although certain limited estimation is permitted under the 2012 Final Rule for some transfers sent by insured institutions, <em data-original="E-03">see</em> § 1005.32(a) and (b), commenters argued that using the additional estimation methodologies permitted under the December Proposal would lead to greater degrees of inaccuracy because of the requirement to disclose the highest estimate possible with respect to certain recipient institution fees where such fees might be unlikely apply.  Furthermore, the proposed estimation methodology would have differed from the bases for estimates described in existing § 1005.32(c), which permit a provider to base an estimate on an approach not listed in subpart B of Regulation E so long as the designated recipient receives the same, or greater, amount of funds than the provider disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Commenters also suggested that under either the 2012 Final Rule or the December Proposal, smaller institutions would be at a disadvantage, compared to their larger competitors, because they would have fewer resources to collect and maintain extensive data sets regarding account fees for every location to which they did or could send a remittance transfer.  Several industry commenters further opined that remittance transfer providers that could provide lower estimates could have a competitive advantage over providers that provided higher (but potentially more accurate) estimates because the providers with lower estimates would appear to be providing designated recipients with more funds, even though the actual fee imposed by the recipient institution for the same designated recipient should generally be the same for transfers sent by the same sender to the same recipient institution. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, some industry commenters argued there was a significant risk that if the highest possible fee a recipient institution could impose on receiving a remittance transfer was disclosed, a sender might unnecessarily overfund a remittance transfer to ensure that the designated recipient received a certain amount.  For example, a commenter explained, that a sender might want to send a remittance transfer to a merchant to pay for a purchase.  The merchant, per its agreement with the receiving institution, might be charged an incoming wire transfer fee.  Although the merchant would not expect the sender to pay this fee, as the merchant had incorporated such cost into its overhead, the sender might believe that he or she is responsible for covering this fee and might increase the amount transferred by the amount of the disclosed fee. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Because of the limitations they perceived with estimates disclosed under the Bureau's methodology described in the December Proposal, the majority of industry commenters requested that the Bureau eliminate the required disclosure of recipient institution fees altogether.  Several of these industry commenters argued, as commenters had argued as part of the 2012 rulemakings, that section 1073 of the Dodd-Frank Act did not expressly require disclosure of recipient institution fees and urged the Bureau to eliminate the required disclosure of recipient institution fees.  A few commenters went further and suggested that the Bureau should eliminate the required disclosure of intermediary fees as well.  Alternatively, industry commenters suggested that the Bureau delay the implementation date for the disclosure of recipient institution fees until resources for ascertaining such fees could be developed, although such commenters did not indicate that such resources were being developed or that they would soon be available. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters were divided in their reactions to the December Proposal's provisions regarding the disclosure of recipient institution fees.  Although some consumer group commenters favored the Bureau's approach in providing increased flexibility and guidance with respect to the disclosure of recipient institution fees, other consumer group commenters believed that the methods of estimation proposed by the Bureau would prove to be problematic for senders and suggested either that the allowance for such estimation be made temporary or that the required disclosure of recipient institution fees be eliminated. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Among consumer group commenters who favored the disclosure of recipient institution fees, some opined that recipient institution fee information could become readily available given current technology, and they encouraged the Bureau to, at the very least, make any additional estimate provisions temporary in nature.  This would, these commenters argued, provide strong incentives to industry to create databases with the necessary information for compliance.  In addition, one comment letter argued that permitting “estimated” price disclosures essentially permits a continuation of the status quo that Congress intended to change by adopting section 1073 of the Dodd-Frank Act.  The commenter further suggested that although a permanent exemption from any disclosure requirements would be premature, a delay in requiring disclosure of recipient institution fees may be needed to provide enough time and the proper incentives for some providers to update their information systems in order to capture this information. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>By contrast, other consumer group commenters maintained that it was appropriate to eliminate the obligation to disclose recipient institution fees given the difficulty remittance transfer providers (or their partners) face in determining these fees.  These commenters argued that, given the inaccuracies inherent in estimating the applicable fees to be applied, senders would be better served by an alternative generic disclosure noting that recipient institutions may charge account fees, rather than requiring the specific disclosure of such fees.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In light of information received through comment letters, additional outreach, and the Bureau's independent monitoring of efforts to implement the 2012 Final Rule, the Bureau believes that it is necessary and proper both to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and to facilitate compliance to exercise its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to eliminate the requirement to disclose recipient institution fees for transfers into an account, except where the recipient institution is acting as an agent of the provider. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As stated in the February Final Rule, the Bureau believes that disclosures regarding the fees imposed by persons other than the remittance transfer provider can benefit senders by making them aware of the impact of these fees, helping to decide how much money to send, facilitating comparison shopping, and aiding in error resolution.  As described in the February Final Rule, in recent years, a number of concerns with regard to the clarity and reliability of information provided to consumers sending remittance transfers have been identified.  Congressional hearings prior to enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act focused on the need for standardized and reliable pre-payment disclosures, suggesting that disclosure of the amount of money to be received by the designated recipient is particularly critical.  Research suggests that consumers place a high value on reliability to ensure that the promised amount is made available to recipients. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 77 FR 6199 (and sources cited therein). </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Despite the public interest in the disclosure of recipient interest fees, however, the Bureau believes that requiring disclosure of such fees in cases in which the recipient institution is not an agent of the provider would at this time either require a substantial delay in implementation of the overall Dodd-Frank Act regime for remittance transfers or produce a significant contraction in access to remittance transfers, particularly for less popular corridors.  The Bureau believes that both of these results would substantially harm consumers and undermine the broader purposes of the statutory scheme.  Accordingly, the Bureau has constructed the exception to relieve the obligation to disclose recipient institution fees absent an agency relationship between the remittance transfer provider and the recipient institution. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that, in practice, this adjustment of the 2012 Final Rule will affect a minority of remittance transfers.  While information on the volume of open-network transfers is limited, the Bureau believes that closed network transfers sent through agents— <em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> transfers for which remittance transfer providers must continue to disclose all third-party fees in accordance with the 2012 Final Rule—account for the majority of remittance transfers. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For the minority of transfers where the exception applies because there is no agency relationship between the remittance transfer provider and the recipient institution, the Bureau has concluded that finalizing the proposed exception in § 1005.32(b)(4) (which would have permitted estimates in certain circumstances) would have significant risks and disadvantages to senders of remittance transfers.  First, despite the greater flexibility that the December Proposal would have provided concerning estimation methodologies, the Bureau is concerned that many remittance transfer providers still would have curtailed services particularly outside of heavily used corridors.  Second, the Bureau is concerned that the resulting estimates would have varied so widely that their use to consumers in calibrating transfer amounts and comparison shopping would have been limited. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that given current limitations, it is appropriate to require use of a more generic disclaimer to warn consumers where recipient institution fees may apply and to change the model forms in a way that will reduce the risk of consumer confusion in attempting to make comparisons where estimates are provided.  The Bureau also believes that it is important to encourage estimates and increasingly reliable methodologies over time, and will continue dialogue with interested stakeholders about how best to make progress toward this goal.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau's conclusion rests in large part on its understanding of the open network systems for sending remittance transfers.  As described above, these networks allow remittance transfer providers to send to accounts at banks worldwide.  However, providers have limited authority or ability to monitor or control the recipient institutions in such networks.  Although the Bureau had expected that industry's implementation efforts would result in the development of the compilation of reliable and current information concerning fees imposed by many recipient institutions for most corridors, the process has been slower and harder than expected and the lack of comprehensive information could lead providers to limit their offerings.  Given the current environment, the Bureau believes that estimating, or in some cases, determining the actual recipient institution fees for transfers to accounts consistent with the 2012 Final Rule would be difficult or impracticable given the myriad institutions to which such remittance transfers may be sent and the myriad fee schedules that may apply across these institutions. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Even under the Bureau's proposal to provide additional flexibility for remittance transfer providers in estimating certain recipient institution fees for transfers to accounts, the comment letters and the Bureau's outreach suggest that the burden of obtaining and maintaining applicable fee information sufficient to provide the permitted estimates in all cases would still be substantial.  The Bureau is concerned that even if it adopted the December Proposal, the requirements to disclose recipient institution fees might cause a number of providers to raise their prices, significantly reduce their offerings, or exit the market due to the requirements related to the disclosure of recipient institution fees.  If any price increase were similar to the size of a recipient institution fee, that alone might offset the benefit of improved information about the size of such fees.  Furthermore, as the Bureau stated in the December Proposal, the Bureau believes that the loss of market participants would be detrimental to senders by decreasing market competition and the convenient availability of remittance transfer services. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Moreover, the Bureau is concerned that the estimate methodologies proposed in the December Proposal would have produced disclosures that varied so widely that their use to senders in calibrating transfer amounts and comparison shopping would have been limited.  In many cases, the December Proposal would have required the remittance transfer provider to over-estimate recipient institution fees, by disclosing the highest possible fee that could be imposed on the remittance transfer with respect to any unknown variable.  To the extent providers used differing methodologies upon which to base their estimates, the disclosed fees could vary significantly across institutions, making it difficult for senders to decide how much money to transmit. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, because these fees would be separately disclosed and included within the total to recipient on the disclosure forms, differences in amounts disclosed among remittance transfer providers could lead senders to mistakenly focus on discrepancies within these fees when comparison shopping, even though the actual fee would likely be the same regardless of the provider so long as the sender transmitted the same amount to the same designated recipient at the same institution using the same transfer method.  While the Bureau believes that it is important to encourage estimates and increasingly reliable methodologies over time, the Bureau has concluded that given current limitations it is appropriate to require use of a more generic disclaimer to alert senders where recipient institution fees may apply and to change the model forms in a way that will reduce the risk of consumer confusion in attempting to make comparisons where estimates are provided.  By providing the disclaimer, senders themselves can investigate such fees.  In addition, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii), providers may be incentivized to seek such information to better compete with providers providing more detailed price information.  The Bureau believes this amendment to the disclosure requirements will best preserve senders' access to competitive remittance transfer markets, while facilitating continued information-gathering about such fees both by senders and providers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Alternatively, the Bureau considered further delaying implementation of the section 1073 protections, to allow remittance transfer providers to continue to seek more reliable fee information in order to reduce implementation burdens and make fee-related disclosures more accurate and thus more useful for senders.  However, the Bureau believes that it is critical to provide senders timely access to the important new consumer protection benefits of the 2012 Final Rule including rights to cancellation and error resolution. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, the Bureau has tailored its amendments to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), and as discussed below, § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii), to focus on the third-party fees that the Bureau believes are most difficult for remittance transfer providers to disclose.  Based on the Bureau's outreach, it appears that providers sending transfers through open network systems have had considerably more success in obtaining information needed to estimate or disclose accurately fees imposed by intermediary institutions, as compared to recipient institutions that maintain ongoing customer relationships with individual designated recipients.  Some providers (or business partners) have changed or contemplated changing the methods they use to send transfers between bank accounts, in order to avoid the imposition of any intermediary fees.  In addition, some providers have worked with correspondents to understand such intermediary fees.  Thus, the Bureau is not eliminating the requirement to disclose pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) intermediary bank fees or to include such amount in the calculation of the amount required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii). </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Similarly, although the Bureau is making an adjustment for recipient institution fees that it believes industry cannot reasonably disclose, it is not adjusting the required disclosures for transfers that a recipient picks up at a paying agent.  As noted above, the additional guidance included in the December Proposal targeted situations in which providers did not have specific knowledge regarding variables that affect the amount imposed by the recipient's institution for receiving a transfer in an account.  By contrast, where the designated recipient's institution is an agent of the remittance transfer provider, the Bureau believes the provider should have access to or be able to contract concerning the disclosure of any fees imposed by such institution.  Consequently, the Bureau is maintaining the provider's obligation under the 2012 Final Rule to disclose a designated recipient institution's fees where such recipient institution is acting as an agent of the provider in the remittance transfer.  Through a provider's contractual arrangements with its agents, the Bureau believes that such information should be readily available to or obtainable by a provider or that the provider can control such fees, based on the terms of the contract between the provider and such agent. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For similar reasons, the Bureau is maintaining the requirement to disclose fees assessed for remittance transfers to credit cards, prepaid cards, or virtual accounts held by an Internet-based or mobile phone company that is not a bank, credit union, or equivalent institution. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 30(h)-3.  In the December Proposal, the Bureau did not specifically propose to allow estimation of these amounts.  Although a few comment letters suggested that the proposed estimates exception should be expanded to cover more than depository institution accounts, such as general purpose reloadable (or prepaid) cards, mobile phones, or mobile or electronic wallets, no commenters suggested that obtaining this information would be as burdensome as the disclosure of depository institution fees.  Indeed, upon further outreach, industry participants largely confirmed that currently the majority of such transactions currently take place within a single network whereby such fees are a matter of contract.  The Bureau believes that the systems for offering such transfers are still nascent and that currently most of these transfers are provided through systems in which remittance transfer providers have contractual arrangements with the recipient institutions, or the providers and the recipient institutions operate within one single network.  The Bureau further believes that these arrangements will likely permit providers to exercise some control over, or learn about, fees charged by recipient institutions.  As these systems grow, the Bureau expects that providers, and any associated networks, can design systems so that any associated fees with respect to such transfers are transparent to providers and senders alike. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe that the same sort of evolution can happen as quickly or easily in existing open network systems, and in particular for the interbank wire transfer system. These systems use communication and settlement protocols that have been developed over decades (or longer) and assume that participating institutions will exercise little control over each other.<footnote ref="6">The modern open network banking system evolved slowly over the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and did not become electronic and automated until the 1970s.  The earliest banks did not transfer money between themselves.  Over time, however, smaller or more remote banks began to rely on larger mutual or central banks that they all trusted to facilitate transfers of funds although the remote banks had no relationship with one another.  Into the mid-Twentieth Century, this system became computerized and banks could electronically message one another. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Ben Norman, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;et al.,&lt;/em&gt; The History of Interbank Settlement Arrangements:  Exploring Central Banks' Role in the Payment System (June 2011), available at: &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1863929.&lt;/em&gt;</footnote>
             Furthermore, these systems depend on the participation of many foreign entities that have no duty or incentive to comply with subpart B of Regulation E.  Consequently, for purposes of determining the fees imposed on the remittance transfer by the designated recipient's institution for receiving a remittance transfer into an account under § 1005.30(h)(2), the Bureau includes transfers into an asset account, regardless of whether or not it is a consumer asset account, established for any purpose and held by a bank, savings association, credit union, or equivalent institution. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 30(h)-3.  The Bureau believes that these institutions are likely subject to legacy systems that cannot easily be modified to capture fee information.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In light of these conclusions, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau is exercising its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to maintain in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) the remittance transfer provider's obligation to disclose covered third-party fees and that such fees be included in the amount disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), discussed further below.  The Bureau believes that providing a total to recipient that reflects the impact of such fees, and separately disclosing these fees, will provide senders with a greater transparency regarding the cost of a remittance transfer. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Insofar as the Bureau is eliminating the required disclosure of non-covered third-party fees, the Bureau is also not adopting the suggestion of several industry and consumer group commenters that to facilitate compliance, the Bureau help develop and maintain a database of recipient institution fees that could be accessed by remittance transfer providers.  The Bureau continues to believe that because providers are engaged in the business of sending remittance transfers and likely will develop relationships with recipient institutions over time, providers are in a better position than the Bureau is to determine applicable fee information.  The Bureau will continue to monitor implementation of this rule and market developments, including whether better information about recipient institution fees becomes more readily available over time.  The Bureau will also engage in stakeholder dialogue about methods to encourage improvements in communications methodologies and data gathering so as to promote the provision of increasingly accurate estimates and disclosures of actual fees over time. </analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Disclosure of Foreign Taxes</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Commenters' arguments regarding the disclosure of foreign taxes have largely paralleled their arguments regarding the disclosure of recipient institution fees.  Notably, since the Board's proposal, industry has argued that the requirement to disclose foreign taxes is unduly burdensome given the number of jurisdictions that may impose taxes and the challenges of determining whether or how various tax exceptions or exclusions may apply.  Although the Bureau recognized the challenges for remittance transfer providers in disclosing foreign taxes, the Bureau also believed that this disclosure would provide senders with greater transparency regarding the cost of a remittance transfer, which the Bureau believed was consistent with the purposes of the EFTA.  Consequently, § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) of the 2012 Final Rule generally would have required that providers disclose foreign taxes and take such taxes into account when calculating the disclosure of the amount to be received under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii).  This disclosure of taxes would have included foreign taxes imposed by a country's central government, as well as taxes imposed by regional, provincial, state, or other local governments. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>After the Bureau published the 2012 Final Rule, industry continued to express concern about the ability of remittance transfer providers to disclose these foreign taxes in two respects.  First, industry argued that it is significantly more burdensome to research and disclose subnational taxes than to research and disclose only foreign taxes imposed by a country's central government, with little commensurate benefit to consumers. Second, industry suggested that the existing guidance on the disclosure of foreign taxes is insufficient where variables that influence the applicability of foreign taxes are not easily knowable by the sender or the provider.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In light of these comments, in its December Proposal, the Bureau proposed two revisions to the 2012 Final Rule regarding foreign tax disclosures.  First, the proposal would have revised § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) to state that only foreign taxes imposed by a country's central government on the remittance transfer need to be disclosed.  Proposed comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-3 would have further clarified that regional, provincial, state, or other local foreign taxes do not need to be disclosed, although the remittance transfer provider could choose to disclose them.  In the event that the subnational taxes were not disclosed, the proposal would have required that a provider state that a disclosure is “Estimated.”  Consistent with this amendment, regional, provincial, state, or other local foreign taxes would not have needed to be taken into account when calculating the disclosure of the amount to be received under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii). </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Second, the December Proposal also would have provided additional flexibility regarding the determination of foreign taxes imposed by a country's central government.  Under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), if a remittance transfer provider did not have specific knowledge regarding variables that affect the amount of these taxes imposed by a person other than the provider, the provider could disclose the highest possible tax that could be imposed on the remittance transfer with respect to any unknown variable.  Where a provider relied on this estimation method, the proposal would have required that a provider state that related disclosures are “Estimated.”</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau sought comment on both aspects of these proposed changes, including whether the proposed revisions would facilitate compliance and how the revisions would impact senders.  Similar to comments about the proposed revisions to the disclosure of recipient institution fees, the Bureau received numerous comments from industry and consumer groups on its proposed elimination of the subnational tax disclosure and also its proposed methods for the estimation of taxes imposed by a foreign country's central government. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to the proposed change related to the elimination of the requirement to disclose subnational taxes and to include such taxes in the calculation of the amount to be received, there was uniform support from industry commenters.  Nearly all industry commenters expressed concern that it was infeasible to attempt to research all potential jurisdictions that might impose a subnational tax.  Further, industry commenters noted that there would be an ongoing and potentially significant cost required to maintain information related to all subnational tax laws throughout the world given the number of potential jurisdictions that could impose a tax.  Additionally, in terms of the feasibility of the disclosure of subnational taxes, one money transmitter also stated that it would be difficult for it to disclose subnational taxes given that its customers were not required, when sending a transfer, to specify a sub-region within a country where the transfer would be picked up. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Another money transmitter also stated that, in its experience, it believed that subnational taxes were rare.  Although this commenter did not cite any examples of tax practice in specific jurisdictions, this commenter argued that many localities wanted to encourage the inflow of transfers, and therefore, would be unlikely to impose subnational taxes.  This commenter and others stated that the cost to determine, in every case, whether subnational taxes applied, a cost that might be passed on to all senders, would outweigh the benefits given that it appeared that such taxes rarely applied in practice. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In contrast to the uniform support by industry commenters for the elimination of the requirement to disclose subnational taxes, consumer group commenters were divided regarding their views about the proposed elimination of the requirement to disclose subnational taxes.  Some consumer group commenters opposed the proposed change and stated that full disclosure of the exact amount of foreign taxes was critical in order for senders to be aware of exactly how much money would be received.  They stated that elimination of the requirement to disclose subnational taxes would harm senders because they would not know with certainty how much money would ultimately be received.  Other consumer group commenters, however, stated that the burden of researching and disclosing subnational taxes outweighed the relative benefit to senders.  These consumer group commenters noted that some remittance transfer providers could withdraw from the market or increase prices if required to research and disclose subnational taxes.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to the Bureau's proposal to allow remittance transfer providers increased flexibility to estimate the taxes imposed by a country's central government, many industry commenters expressed concern that the December Proposal did not sufficiently ease the burden of researching foreign taxes.  These industry commenters raised several concerns with respect to the proposed estimated disclosure of taxes imposed by a foreign country's central government.  Some industry participants commented that they did not have the capability to research the relevant tax laws in the first place because they did not have foreign contacts, or, alternatively, that they did not have the resources to expend to determine the applicable foreign tax laws.  Thus, they asserted that an ability to estimate would not facilitate compliance since such estimation would require an underlying knowledge of the foreign tax laws. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters, particularly smaller banks and credit unions, also noted that remittance transfer providers were reluctant to rely on information from third-party service providers (such as larger correspondent institutions) because they would have no means to verify the accuracy of the information provided by the third-parties.  Further, even where the tax information was accurate, some industry commenters stated that there could be a high cost associated with relying on a third-party provider to obtain that foreign tax information.  Similar to industry comments about the disclosure of subnational taxes, commenters stated that these costs not only included the upfront costs of acquiring the tax information but also ongoing costs required to maintain and update tax information.  For example, commenters expressed concern that, even if a provider (or a third-party selling the tax information) determined that a particular country did not tax remittance transfers, the provider would need to continue to monitor that country's tax law to know whether any new tax laws were enacted in the future. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters (as well as some consumer group commenters) stated that some of the burden resulting from the disclosure of foreign taxes imposed by a country's central government could be solved if the Bureau itself developed a tax database that was made available to remittance transfer providers.  Industry commenters noted that a Bureau-provided database would eliminate the cost and potential inaccuracy that could result from each provider's individual attempts to determine the applicable foreign taxes. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Along similar lines, the Bureau learned through outreach that at least one trade association is developing a database containing information about foreign taxes imposed on remittance transfers by a country's central government.  The trade association informed the Bureau that, by working with a third-party, it thought it could eventually determine the relevant tax laws for most countries.  The trade association, however, stated that there were several challenges associated with determining and disclosing the applicable tax under the proposed estimation method.  According to the trade association and other commenters, one concern was that many foreign taxes have exceptions and exclusions that are not imposed uniformly on all transfers.  The trade association noted that, even if a database listed applicable tax laws, it might be difficult for remittance transfer providers, particularly smaller providers, to apply these exceptions and incorporate the exceptions into computer programs or onto forms to arrive at an accurate tax disclosure.  Some industry commenters also noted that, if a provider did not apply an exception, that provider might appear to be imposing a higher tax than another provider that applied the exception, even if the tax is the same.  Thus, these commenters stated that a sender might misidentify the cheapest provider. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Relatedly, several other industry commenters expressed concern that a tax law might be misinterpreted or misunderstood by the remittance transfer provider because of the challenges of interpreting foreign laws.  As a result, several industry commenters and a trade association stated that the Bureau should provide a safe harbor for providers that use some reasonable processes to acquire the tax information.  Other commenters stated that they would favor a safe harbor whereby, if the provider relied on some reasonable source of information in obtaining tax information, that provider would not be liable if the disclosed tax was incorrect. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters also echoed similar comments to those made with respect to the December Proposal's provisions regarding the recipient institution fee disclosures, stating that the estimated tax disclosure would be of limited benefit to senders because they believed that in many instances the same tax likely would apply to all transfers to a particular country.  As a result, a disclosure of the foreign tax would not improve a sender's ability to comparison shop among remittance transfer providers.  In addition, other commenters noted that because the Bureau's proposed estimation method required a disclosure of the highest possible foreign tax that could be imposed with respect to any unknown variable, a sender might transfer more money than was required to compensate for the high estimated tax that the sender believed would be deducted.  The commenters noted, for example, that if a sender was transferring funds to a foreign merchant, the higher disclosed tax could harm the sender who inadvertently provided more money than was necessary to pay for a good or service. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In contrast to industry commenters and as with respect to the Bureau's proposal to eliminate the requirement to disclose subnational taxes, consumer groups were divided with respect to their comments about the proposed change to allow estimation to be used in the determination of the foreign country tax disclosure.  Some consumer groups stated that the estimation of foreign taxes would harm senders because they would not know exactly how much money would be received.  In contrast, other consumer groups supported the Bureau's proposed estimation method for those taxes imposed by a country's central government.  These consumer groups stated that the Bureau's proposed estimation method would facilitate compliance, and thereby encourage providers to stay in the market or prevent providers from increasing prices.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Similar to its reasoning with respect to the elimination of the requirement to disclose certain recipient institution fees, as a result of comments received, additional outreach, and the Bureau's independent monitoring of efforts to implement the 2012 Final Rule, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper both to further the purposes of the EFTA and to facilitate compliance to exercise its exception authority under EFTA section 904(c) to eliminate the requirement that remittance transfer providers include taxes collected by a person other than the provider—including both subnational taxes and taxes imposed by a foreign country's central government, in the calculation of the amount to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii).  Consistent with this revision, the Bureau is also eliminating the requirement to disclose taxes imposed by a person other than the remittance transfer provider under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) since such taxes are no longer necessary to clarify the calculation of the amount to be received under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii).  Under the 2013 Final Rule, a provider continues to be required to disclose any taxes collected by the provider, as described under § 1005.31(b)(ii), but providers are no longer required to disclose taxes collected by other persons.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As stated in the February Final Rule, the Bureau believes that disclosures regarding the taxes collected by a person other than the remittance transfer provider can benefit senders by making them aware of the impact of these taxes on the total amount transferred, deciding how much money to transfer, facilitating comparison shopping, and aiding in error resolution.  Yet, while this foreign tax information is important for consumers, the Bureau is concerned that requiring disclosure of  taxes collected by a person other than the provider could at this time produce increased costs for all transactions or result in a significant contraction in access to remittance transfers, particularly for less popular corridors.  Similar to its decision about eliminating the requirement to disclose certain recipient institution fees, the Bureau believes that both of these results would substantially harm consumers and undermine the broader purposes of the statutory scheme.  Accordingly, the Bureau has concluded that in the current environment, this amendment to the tax disclosure requirements will best preserve access to competitive prices for remittance transfers for a wide range of countries.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As with fees, one key factor in the Bureau's decision was a concern that the required tax disclosure might limit the availability of remittance services to certain countries or result in an increased cost for many transfers.  With respect to cost increases, under the 2012 Final Rule and the December Proposal, most remittance transfer providers would have needed to conduct research to determine (or purchase information regarding) the relevant foreign tax laws, potentially for many countries.  These providers would also need to expend resources to update this information on a regular basis.  Although one industry association has been undertaken to develop a database of applicable central government taxes, that association acknowledged several challenges both in developing the database and with how individual providers would make use of the data contained in it.  For example, validation and continuous updating of the information collected remains a substantial concern.  As described above, the Bureau is concerned that many providers would pass the costs associated with these efforts on to senders in the form of increased prices that would affect remittance transfers across the board, even to countries in which no such taxes are actually imposed.  The Bureau also remains concerned that the cost of maintaining the required tax information could cause providers to exit the market, or limit their offerings—even if the requirement was limited to taxes imposed by a foreign country's central government.  Some providers, for example, might curtail their services and limit transfers only to the highest traffic corridors in order to minimize their necessary foreign tax law research.  Because some providers might restrict their services to certain corridors with less volume, a sender might have limited ability to send transfers to those regions. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As a result, while the Bureau generally believes that senders can benefit from transparency regarding the foreign tax disclosure, in the present market, the cost of obtaining the necessary tax information may exceed the benefit of this information to many senders.  As with recipient institution fees, the Bureau also recognizes that in many instances the benefit of the disclosure may be minimized because the actual foreign tax imposed is likely to be uniform across all remittance transfers to a particular person in a particular country (and, therefore, the same tax would apply).<footnote ref="7">The Bureau recognizes that this uniformity may not always be the case. For example, a tax could be imposed differently based on whether the tax law treated transfers sent through a closed or open network differently. But, for most transfers, the Bureau believes that a tax law would apply in the same manner where a transfer was of the same amount to the same destination in a country.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, as with the estimation of recipient institution fees, the disclosure of the highest tax estimates based on any unknown variable, as required in the December Proposal, could result in consumer confusion where providers disclosed different tax estimates.  Even if third-party providers developed common databases of information, there is still a risk of inconsistent disclosures depending on providers' knowledge of potentially relevant variables, practices, and interpretations of foreign tax law.  The Bureau believes that using the general disclaimer and moving any voluntarily provided estimates or actual numbers lower on the form will help to reduce the risk that senders mistakenly choose providers based on discrepancies in tax estimates.  Further, rather than adopting a systematic rule that tends to overestimate tax rates, the Bureau believes that senders may prefer to apply different approaches to different types of transfers, for instance by being more conservative about the risk of overfunding a transfer to a business as compared to a family member. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also does not believe that it is appropriate or feasible to create a safe harbor for remittance transfer providers that rely on a third-party database or some other third-party source for tax information.  At this time, the Bureau is not aware of any data source whose accuracy it can guarantee, absent extensive monitoring.  The Bureau is not currently positioned to evaluate the accuracy of each database that might be created nor can it determine whether providers are reasonably researching, interpreting, or applying the applicable foreign tax laws.  Similarly, the Bureau does not believe that currently it is positioned to create a database itself.  In addition, even if a database existed, as noted above, it would still be necessary to determine how the particular tax laws and exceptions or exclusions applied, and the Bureau believes that providers are better positioned to learn over time how foreign tax laws apply to individual transfers. </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Overall, given the current burden of researching the foreign taxes and the potential risks of sender confusion, increased cost, and reduced transfer services, the Bureau believes that the best result at this time is to eliminate the obligation to disclose taxes collected by parties other than the remittance transfer provider and to eliminate the requirement to include this amount in the calculation of the amount to be received by the designated recipient.  The Bureau, however, notes that its decision is based on the current feasibility and cost associated with determining or estimating such taxes imposed on a remittance transfer, as well as the potential impact on market structure and pricing practices.  The Bureau intends to monitor whether the development and availability of information regarding taxes collected on a remittance transfer by a person other than the provider becomes more feasible in the future.  The Bureau will also engage in stakeholder dialogue about methods to encourage improvements in communications methodologies and data gathering so as to promote the provision of increasingly accurate estimates and disclosures of foreign taxes over time.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Conforming Changes to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi)</title>
        <analysisParagraph>In light of the changes the Bureau is making with respect to the disclosure of non-covered third-party fees and foreign taxes, § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) in the 2013 Final Rule requires only the disclosure of covered third-party fees.  The 2013 Final Rule also makes conforming edits to comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-1 to reflect that the disclosure of covered third-party fees must be made in the currency in which the funds will be received by the designated recipient.  While the revised § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) provides that only covered third-party fees be disclosed under this subsection, as discussed below, under § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) a remittance transfer provider would remain free to disclose separately any non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected by a person other than the provider of which it is aware, to the extent consistent with the parameters of that section. </analysisParagraph>

    <analysisSection target="1005-30-e-1" notice="2012-1728" date="2012-02-07">
      <title>30(e)(1) General Definition</title>
      <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(g)(2)(A) defines a “remittance transfer” as an “electronic (as defined in section 106(2) of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. 7007 <em data-original="E-03">et seq.</em> [(“E-Sign Act”)]) transfer of funds requested by a sender located in any State to a designated recipient that is initiated by a remittance transfer provider.” The statute further specifies that such a transaction is a remittance transfer whether or not the sender holds an account with the remittance transfer provider and whether or not the remittance transfer is also an electronic fund transfer, as defined in EFTA section 903. The statute thus brings within the scope of the EFTA certain transactions that have traditionally been outside the scope of the EFTA, if those transactions meet the elements of the definition of “remittance transfer.” Such transactions include cash-based remittance transfers sent through a money transmitter as well as consumer wire transfers and international ACH transactions. Proposed § 205.30(d) incorporated the definition of “remittance transfer” in EFTA section 919(g)(2), with revisions for clarity. The Board also proposed commentary to provide further guidance on the definition, as well as examples of transactions that are and are not remittance transfers under the rule.
          </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.30(d)(1) set forth the general definition in EFTA section 919(g)(2)(A). Proposed § 205.30(d)(1) stated that a remittance transfer means the electronic transfer of funds requested by a sender to a designated recipient that is sent by a remittance transfer provider. Proposed § 205.30(d)(1) further stated that the term applies regardless of whether the sender holds an account with the remittance transfer provider and regardless of whether the transfer is also an electronic fund transfer, as defined in Regulation E. Section 1005.30(e)(1) of the final rule incorporates the definition generally as proposed, with additional revisions to the commentary for clarity.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters, particularly financial institution commenters, opposed the definition of “remittance transfer” as overly broad. These commenters argued that the definition should not apply to open network transactions, such as international wire transfers and ACH transactions, or alternatively, that a separate rule tailored to these transactions should be adopted. Citing to legislative history, these commenters argued that the statute was intended only to address traditional cash-based, low-dollar-value remittances. Industry commenters argued that based on the difficulty with complying with the rule's disclosure requirements, as discussed below in connection with § 1005.31, including open network transactions in the remittance transfer definition could have unintended consequences. These commenters maintained that providers would withdraw from the market or restrict where transfers may be sent if the final rule were applied to international wire transfers and ACH transactions, and that this would either decrease consumer access to remittance transfers or increase costs to consumers. Thus, these commenters argued that the Bureau should exercise its authority under EFTA section 904(c) to exempt these transactions from the definition of “remittance transfer.” Industry commenters also urged the Bureau to adopt other exclusions and limitations to the “remittance transfer” definition, which are addressed below in the discussion of § 1005.30(e)(2). In contrast, consumer group commenters supported the proposed definition of “remittance transfer,” including its inclusion of open network transactions. These commenters argued that the proposed definition is consistent with the language of the statute and the purpose of the statute's provisions.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau acknowledges the compliance challenges raised by the inclusion of open network transactions. Nevertheless, the Bureau believes the unambiguous language of the statute requires coverage of these transactions, such as wire transfers. The statute is broad in scope, specifically covering transactions that are account-based and that are not electronic fund transfers. The Bureau finds no statutory language to support excluding open network transactions—indeed, quite the contrary: The statute includes a temporary exception for certain insured institutions permitting estimates to be used in providing disclosures under specified circumstances in EFTA section 919(a)(4)(A). There would be no need for such an exception if open network transactions were not covered by the statute. Congress specifically recognized that it would be difficult for financial institutions to meet certain disclosure requirement with regard to open network transactions and tailored a specific accommodation to allow use of reasonably accurate estimates for an interim period until financial institutions can develop methods to determine exact disclosures, such as fees and taxes charged by third parties. Therefore, the Bureau does not believe it should exercise its exception authority under EFTA section 904(c) to exclude open network transactions from the definition of “remittance transfer.”</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comments 30(d)-1 through 30(d)-4 provided further guidance on each of the elements of the proposed definition of “remittance transfer.” Proposed comment 30(d)-1 provided that there must be an electronic transfer of funds. The term “electronic” has the meaning given in section 106(2) of the E-Sign Act. There may be an electronic transfer of funds if a provider makes an electronic book entry between different settlement accounts to effectuate the transfer. However, the proposed comment explained that where a sender mails funds directly to a recipient, or provides funds to a courier for delivery to a foreign country, there has not been an electronic transfer of funds, and thus no remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Citing the electronic book entry comment, one commenter suggested that the Bureau should expressly exclude the sale or issuance of checks, money orders, or other paper instruments from the “remittance transfer” definition. The Bureau agrees that issuing a paper check, draft, money order, or other paper instrument to be mailed abroad generally does not constitute an electronic transfer of funds. For clarity, the final comment, adopted as comment 30(e)-1, notes that where a provider issues a check, draft, or other paper instrument to be mailed abroad, there is not an electronic transfer of funds, except as described below with respect to online bill payments.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>A few commenters suggested that with respect to online bill payments, a consumer does not request an electronic transfer of funds. Instead, commenters stated that the consumer requests only that an amount be paid out of an account, and the payment method is generally left up to the institution. Thus, these commenters argued, there is no specific sender request to send a remittance transfer. The final rule adopts an approach that is consistent with the treatment of online bill payment services as an EFT under Regulation E in § 1005.3(b). Specifically, comment 3(b)(1)-1.vi. makes clear that an EFT includes “a payment made by a bill payer under a bill-payment service available to a consumer via computer or other electronic means, unless the terms of the bill-payment service explicitly state that all payments, or all payments to a particular payee or payees, will be solely by check, draft, or similar paper instrument drawn on the consumer's account, and the payee or payees that will be paid in this manner are identified to the consumer.”</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, final comment 30(e)-1 provides that an electronic transfer of funds occurs for a payment made by a provider under a bill-payment service available to a consumer via computer or other electronic means, unless the terms of the bill-payment service explicitly state that all payments, or all payments to a particular payee or payees, will be solely by check, draft, or similar paper instrument drawn on the consumer's account to be mailed abroad, and the payee or payees that will be paid in this manner are identified to the consumer. Thus, with respect to such a bill-payment service, if a provider provides a check, draft or similar paper instrument drawn on a consumer's account to be mailed abroad for a payee that is not identified to the consumer as described above, this payment by check, draft or similar payment instrument will be considered an electronic transfer of funds. In this case, the sender has requested the transfer using a bill-payment service available to a consumer via computer or other electronic means and would expect the transfer to be conducted electronically because the terms of the bill-payment service have not explicitly stated that payments to the particular payee will be solely by a check, draft, or similar paper instrument drawn on the consumer's account to be mailed abroad. In this case, the Bureau believes that it not appropriate to allow a provider to avoid providing the disclosures required by § 1005.31 at the time of the sender's request, simply because the payee may ultimately be paid by a check, draft or similar paper instrument drawn on the consumer's account mailed abroad.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 30(d)-2 provided that the definition of “remittance transfer” requires a specific sender to request a remittance transfer provider send a remittance transfer. The proposed comment explained that a deposit by a consumer into a checking or savings account does not itself constitute such a request, even if a person in a foreign country is an authorized user on that account, where the consumer retains the ability to withdraw funds in the account. This comment is not adopted in the final rule, as inconsistent with guidance adopted in comment 30(c)-2.ii. As discussed above under the section-by-section analysis to § 1005.30(c), when a sender requests that a remittance transfer provider send an electronic transfer of funds to a recipient's account, the location of the account determines whether the transfer is made to a designated recipient and thus is a remittance transfer. If the recipient's account is located in a State, the transfer will not be a remittance transfer because the transfer will not be received at a location in a foreign country, and thus the recipient would not be a “designated recipient.” By contrast, if the recipient's account is located in a foreign country, the transfer will be a remittance transfer, even if the sender has the ability to withdraw funds in the account, because the transfer will be received at a location in a foreign country, and the recipient would be a “designated recipient.” <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 30(c)-2.ii.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 30(d)-3 provided that the definition of “remittance transfer” also requires that the transfer be sent to a designated recipient. As noted above, the definition of “designated recipient” requires a person to be identified by the sender as the authorized recipient of a remittance transfer to be sent by a remittance transfer provider. Proposed comment 30(d)-3 explained that there is no designated recipient unless the sender specifically identifies the recipient of a transfer. Proposed comment 30(d)-3 specified that there would be a designated recipient if, for example, the sender instructs a remittance transfer provider to send a prepaid card to a specified recipient in a foreign country, and the sender does not retain the ability to draw down funds on the prepaid card. In contrast, proposed comment 30(d)-3 specified that there would be no designated recipient where the sender retains the ability to withdraw funds, such as when a person in a foreign country is made an authorized user on the sender's checking account, because the remittance transfer provider cannot identify the ultimate recipient of the funds. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis to § 1005.30(c), both examples are not adopted, as inconsistent with guidance in comment 30(c)-2.ii. and iii.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 30(d)-4 provided that the definition of “remittance transfer” requires that the remittance transfer must be sent by a remittance transfer provider. The proposed comment explained that this means that there must be an intermediary actively involved in sending the electronic transfer of funds. Examples in the proposed comment included a person (other than the sender) sending an instruction to an agent in a foreign country to make funds available to a recipient; executing a payment order pursuant to a consumer's instructions; executing a consumer's online bill payment request; or otherwise engaging in the business of accepting or debiting funds for transmission to a recipient and transmitting those funds.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>However, the proposed comment explained that a payment card network or other third party payment service that is functionally similar to a payment card network does not send a remittance transfer when a consumer designates a debit or credit card as the payment method to purchase goods or services from a foreign merchant. For example, in such a case, the payment card network or third party payment service is not directly engaged with the sender to send a transfer of funds to a person in a foreign country; rather, the network or third party payment service is only providing contemporaneous third-party payment processing and settlement services on behalf of the merchant or the remittance transfer provider, rather than on behalf of the sender. Similarly, where a consumer provides a checking or other account number directly to a merchant as payment for goods or services, the merchant is not acting as a remittance transfer provider when it submits the payment information for processing.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Commenters generally supported the proposed comment. One commenter suggested that the Bureau should revise the discussion about the use of a payment card network using a debit or credit card as a payment method to include the use of a payment card network using a prepaid card for consistency with other provisions of the rule.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The final comment is adopted as comment 30(e)-2, and is revised. As with the proposed comment, the final comment provides that the definition of “remittance transfer” requires that the remittance transfer must be sent by a remittance transfer provider. The final comment explains that this means that there must be an intermediary that is directly engaged with the sender to send an electronic transfer of funds on behalf of the sender to a designated recipient. The final comment clarifies that a payment card network or other third party payment service that is functionally similar to a payment card network does not send a remittance transfer when a consumer provides a debit, credit, or prepaid card directly to a foreign merchant as the payment method to purchase goods or services. In such a case, the payment card network or third party payment service is not directly engaged with the sender to send a transfer of funds to a person in a foreign country; rather, the network or third party payment service is merely providing contemporaneous third-party payment processing and settlement services on behalf of the merchant or the card issuer, rather than on behalf of the sender. The final comment in 30(e)-2 also clarifies that in such a case, the card issuer also is not directly engaged with the sender to send an electronic transfer of funds to the foreign merchant when the card issuer provides payment to the merchant. Similarly, where a consumer provides a checking or other account number, or a debit, credit or prepaid card, directly to a foreign merchant as payment for goods or services, the final comment clarifies that the merchant is not acting as an intermediary that sends a transfer of funds on behalf of the sender when it submits the payment information for processing. The Bureau notes that this comment applies only for purposes of this rule. In other contexts, a person may act as a provider even when it is not directly engaged with the consumer to provide a consumer financial product or service.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, comment 30(e)-2 also discusses the situation where a card issuer or a payment card network is an intermediary that is directly engaged with the sender to obtain funds using the sender's debit, prepaid or credit card and to send those funds to a recipient's checking account located in a foreign country. In this case, the final comment clarifies that the card issuer or payment card network is an intermediary that is directly engaged with the sender to send an electronic transfer of funds on behalf of the sender, and this transfer of funds is a remittance transfer because it is made to a designated recipient. <em data-original="E-03">See also</em> comment 30(c)-2.ii.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As noted in the proposal, some transactions that have not traditionally been considered remittance transfers will fall within the scope of the rule. In contrast, other transfer methods specifically marketed for use by a consumer to send money abroad, but that do not meet all elements of the definition of “remittance transfer,” may fall outside the scope of the rule (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> a prepaid card where the participants in the prepaid card program do not send a card to a designated recipient in a foreign country). While the Board stated that it believed the proposed definition of “remittance transfer” in § 205.30(d) implemented the broad statutory definition, the Board solicited comment on whether it should exempt online bill payments made through the sender's institution, including preauthorized bill payments, from the rule, as it could be challenging for institutions to provide timely disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Most industry commenters urged the Bureau to exempt online bill payments from the rule, including preauthorized bill payments, given the challenges associated with providing disclosures for transfers that occur in the future. Commenters stated that the disclosures for such payments would be burdensome and would provide only marginal benefits to consumers, particularly given that Regulation E already addresses online bill payments. Commenters also noted that different coverage would apply to payments initiated through a financial institution, which would be covered, versus payments initiated directly with a billing party, which would not be covered. With respect to preauthorized bill payments, commenters stated that it would be impracticable to provide pre-payment disclosures when the request is made for transactions that could be scheduled months in advance.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Overall, the Bureau believes the protections afforded by the statute favor the inclusion of online bill payments in the rule, as well as other types of transfers that a sender schedules in advance. subpart A of Regulation E applies to EFTs from an account at a financial institution and provides certain protections to consumers. However, the subpart A provisions do not require disclosures regarding the exchange rate to be applied at transfer or certain other items that must be disclosed under EFTA section 919 and this rule (although related up-front fees would be disclosed in or with the account agreement). In addition, the Bureau also understands that there are non-bank money transmitters not covered by existing provisions in Regulation E that offer international bill payment services.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Moreover, some of the disclosure challenges raised by commenters are similar to those that have been raised in connection with other remittance transfer methods that are included in the rule, for example, where the exchange rate is not necessarily known at the time of transfer. The Bureau recognizes that the rule's coverage differs depending on whether a foreign payee is paid through a remittance transfer provider or paid directly by a consumer. However, this difference arises due to the EFTA's definition of “remittance transfer.” As discussed above, for a transfer to be considered a “remittance transfer,” the transfer must involve an intermediary that is directly engaged with the sender to send an electronic transfer of funds on behalf of the sender to a designated recipient. A foreign merchant is not acting as an intermediary that sends a transfer of funds on behalf of the sender when it processes a payment paid to it directly by the sender. In addition, in this case, the financial institution is not directly engaged with the sender to send an electronic transfer of funds to the foreign merchant when the institution provides payment to the merchant. The Bureau believes this is different from the situation where an institution offers online international bill payment services to consumers. In this circumstance, the institution is directly engaged with the sender to send an electronic transfer of funds on behalf of the sender to a designated recipient. Thus, the final rule does not exclude online bill payments from the definition. As a result, under the final rule, providers will generally need to provide pre-payment disclosures and receipts for these types of transfers in accordance with § 1005.31.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>However, in light of the timing challenges noted above, the final rule sets forth tailored disclosure and cancellation requirements with respect to certain remittance transfers that a sender schedules in advance, including preauthorized remittance transfers (defined and discussed above in § 1005.30(d)), in a new § 1005.36. In addition, the Bureau is issuing the January 2012 Proposed Rule, published elsewhere in today's <em data-original="E-04">Federal Register,</em> soliciting comment on alternative disclosure and cancellation requirements with respect to these transfers. These are discussed in more detail below in the discussion of § 1005.36.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 30(d)-5 provided a non-exclusive list of examples of transactions that are, and are not, remittance transfers. The list addressed online bill payments in the examples in 30(d)-5.i.E. and 30(d)-5.ii.C. However, electronic transfers of funds to be sent abroad can also be scheduled through other means, such as over the telephone, and such scheduled transfers may not necessarily relate specifically to the payment of bills. Thus, while the final comment, renumbered as comment 30(e)-3, does not contain an exhaustive list of examples, in order to clarify the rule's application, the online bill payment examples in the final comment have been revised to more generally address transfers that senders can schedule in advance, including preauthorized remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>30(e)(2) Exceptions</title>
      <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 919(g)(2)(B) states that a remittance transfer does not include a transfer described in EFTA section 919(g)(2)(A) “in an amount that is equal to or lesser than the amount of a small-value transaction determined, by rule, to be excluded from the requirements under section 906(a)” of the EFTA. EFTA section 906(a) addresses the requirements for electronic terminal receipts. The Board previously determined by rule that financial institutions are not subject to the requirement to provide electronic terminal receipts for small-value transfers of $15 or less. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.9(e). Proposed § 205.30(d)(2) incorporated this exception for small-value transfers by providing that remittance transfers do not include transfer amounts of $15 or less.

The $15 exception refers to the amount that will be transferred to the designated recipient in the currency in which the transfer will be funded, as described in § 1005.31(b)(1)(i).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters urged the Bureau to adopt a variety of additional exceptions to the rule, in addition to exempting wire transfers and other open network transactions. Most industry commenters argued that the Bureau should exclude wire transfers and ACH transactions above a certain dollar amount, generally ranging from $500 to $1,000. These commenters argued that the average value of consumer transfers from the United States is lower than the dollar thresholds that they advocated for, so these thresholds would capture most traditional remittances, while excluding higher-dollar transfers that they argued were not intended to be captured in the statute. Several commenters also presented data that many wire transfers exceed the suggested dollar amount, and thus, such an exclusion would limit the costs and risks of the proposal, including fraud risks; would mitigate risks associated with the loss of UCC Article 4A coverage for wire transfers (as described in more detail below); and would more properly focus the final rule on traditional remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The final rule does not contain an exclusion for remittance transfers above a specified dollar amount. The Bureau believes that consumers who choose to transfer funds less frequently but in higher dollar amounts or who send relatively large remittance transfers to pay tuition, medical, and other larger bills should receive the same protections as frequent, low-value senders. Indeed, given the amounts involved, such consumers may stand to benefit even more from the disclosures and error resolution rights afforded by the rule to ensure that the proper amount is received by the recipient. Accordingly, the Bureau believes that an exception based solely on a dollar amount would not be consistent with the purposes of the statute. Finally, the dollar amounts suggested by the commenters did not account for variations in average transfer amounts by destination region or type of transfer, some of which exceed the thresholds proposed by commenters.<footnote ref="68">Chishti, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;supra&lt;/em&gt; note 6.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Similarly, the Bureau does not believe that the rule should exclude remittance transfers requested by high net-worth consumers, as urged by one commenter. Again, there is no indication that Congress intended such an exclusion. Further, a high net-worth consumer has an interest in knowing the amount that will be received by a recipient, and the applicable exchange rate, just as a consumer who does not have a high net worth. A high net-worth consumer also has a similar stake in the resolution of any errors.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The final rule does contain one new exclusion. Several commenters argued that the final rule should exclude from the definition of “remittance transfer” any transfers the primary purposes of which is the purchase or sale of securities or commodities as described in § 1005.3(c)(4). Section 1005.3(c)(4) exempts from the definition of “electronic fund transfer” any transfer of funds the primary purposes of which is the purchase or sale of a security or commodity where the security or commodity is: (i) Regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; (ii) purchased or sold through a broker-dealer regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission or through a futures commission merchant regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; or (iii) held in book-entry form by a Federal Reserve Bank or Federal agency. To effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to adopt a new § 1005.30(e)(2)(ii) to exclude from the definition of “remittance transfer” any transfer that is excluded from the definition of “electronic fund transfer” under § 1005.3(c)(4). This exception is narrow in that it only exempts transfers of funds the primary purposes of which is the purchase or sale of certain securities or commodities, as discussed above. The Bureau believes that use of its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) in this circumstance is appropriate so as not to impact the purchase or sale of securities or commodities.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Application of the EFTA; Relationship to Uniform Commercial Code</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As described above, the statute applies to remittance transfers whether or not they are electronic fund transfers. This raises certain issues with respect to traditional cash-based remittance transfers sent through money transmitters, which have not previously been covered by the EFTA or Regulation E, as well as international wire transfers, which are not EFTs.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The statute outlines the application of the EFTA to remittance transfers that are not electronic fund transfers. Specifically, EFTA section 919(e)(1) states that a remittance transfer that is not an electronic fund transfer is not subject to any of the provisions of EFTA sections 905 through 913. For example, a money transmitter sending a remittance transfer (that is not an EFT) is not subject to the requirement in EFTA section 906(b), as implemented in § 1005.9(b), to provide periodic statements to consumers. The transmitter will, however, generally be subject to other provisions of the EFTA, including provisions on liability under EFTA sections 916 through 918. EFTA section 919(e)(2)(A) also clarifies that a transaction that will not otherwise be an electronic fund transfer under the EFTA, such as a wire transfer, does not become an electronic fund transfer because it is a remittance transfer under EFTA section 919.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Until the Dodd-Frank Act provisions become effective, wire transfers are entirely exempt from the EFTA and Regulation E and instead are governed by State law through State enactment of Article 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code. UCC Article 4A primarily governs the rights and responsibilities among the commercial parties for wire transfers, including payment obligations among the parties and allocation of risk of loss for unauthorized or improperly executed payment orders.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>UCC Article 4A-108 provides that UCC Article 4A does not apply “to a funds transfer, <em data-original="E-03">any part of which is governed by the Electronic Fund Transfer Act”</em> (emphasis added). When EFTA section 919, as implemented by this rule, becomes effective, wire transfers sent on a consumer's behalf that are remittance transfers will be governed in part by the EFTA. As noted in the proposal, EFTA section 919(e)(1) explicitly applies the EFTA to remittance transfers that are not electronic fund transfers, except for certain enumerated provisions. Further, the disclosure and error resolution requirements for remittance transfers are set forth in the EFTA. As a result, by operation of UCC Article 4A-108, the Bureau believes UCC Article 4A will no longer apply to such international consumer wire transfers.<footnote ref="69">Commercial wire transfers are not affected because a “sender” must be a consumer.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Many commenters, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), argued that this outcome creates legal uncertainty that will disrupt the long-standing legal framework governing the allocation of risks among financial institutions of wire transfers. Industry commenters urged the Bureau to preempt any provision of State law that prevents a remittance transfer from being treated as a funds transfer under UCC Article 4A based solely upon the inclusion of the remittance transfer provisions in EFTA section 919. Specifically, commenters urged the Bureau to preempt UCC Article 4A-108. Under this suggested approach, the error resolution provisions of EFTA section 919(b)(1) would govern remittance transfers as between a sender and a remittance transfer provider, but the remaining provisions in UCC Article 4A would continue to govern the allocation of risk of loss as between the remittance transfer provider and another financial institution that carries out part of the transfer (to the extent not otherwise inconsistent with the rule).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Under EFTA section 922 and § 1005.12, the Bureau may determine whether a State law relating to, among other things, electronic fund transfers is preempted by the EFTA or Regulation E. However, the statutory preemption provisions states that a State law may be preempted only if the State law is inconsistent with the EFTA or Regulation E and then only to the extent of the inconsistency. 15 U.S.C. 1693s. Moreover, the statute and regulation provide that a State law is not inconsistent with any provision if it is more protective of consumers. The Bureau does not believe that UCC Article 4A-108 is inconsistent with the EFTA. No provision of the EFTA conflicts with UCC Article 4A-108, and UCC Article 4A-108 does not require or permit a practice prohibited by the EFTA. <em data-original="E-03">See, e.g.,</em> § 1005.12(b)(2)(i). Rather, UCC Article 4A-108 provides when State law applies to fund transfers, including consumer wire transfers, and specifically states that UCC Article 4A does not apply if the EFTA “governs” the transaction. The amendments to the EFTA under the Dodd-Frank Act address consumer wire transfers, but do not address the application of State law to those transfers. Applying the EFTA preemption provisions to effectively require the application of more State laws than would apply in the absence of such action is simply not what the EFTA preemption standard provides.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In the May 2011 Proposed Rule, the Board noted that Congress amended the EFTA's preemption provision to include a specific reference to State gift card laws when it enacted new EFTA protections for gift cards as part of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (Credit Card Act).<footnote ref="70">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; Credit Card Act § 402, Public Law 111-24, 123 Stat. 1734 (2009). The preemption provision was amended to describe how certain State gift card laws may be preempted, to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with the EFTA, in the same manner as State EFT laws.</footnote>
             By contrast, Congress did not amend the EFTA's preemption provision with respect to State laws relating to remittance transfers, including those that are not electronic fund transfers, when it enacted the Dodd-Frank Act.<footnote ref="71">Several commenters noted that EFTA section 920 is excluded from the list of “enumerated consumer laws” under section 1002(12)(c) of the Dodd-Frank Act. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, EFTA section 920 addressed the EFTA's relation to State laws. Section 1075 of the Dodd-Frank Act created a new EFTA section 920 relating to debit interchange fees, which is the provision excluded under Dodd-Frank section 1002(12)(c). The relation to State laws provision is now contained in EFTA section 922.</footnote>
             In response, some commenters argued that Sections 1041(a) and (b) of the Dodd-Frank Act, which discusses the relationship between Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act and State law, separately permit the Bureau to preempt UCC Article 4A-108. These provisions may be invoked, however, only if the Bureau finds an inconsistency between Title X and State law. The Bureau does not believe that such an inconsistency exists. Moreover, Section 1041(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act specifically provides, with one exception not relevant here, that no provision of Title X “shall be construed as modifying, limiting, or superseding the operation of any provision of an enumerated consumer law that relates to the application of a law in effect in any State with respect to such Federal law.”</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several commenters suggested that the Bureau incorporate UCC Article 4A, or a similar framework in place of UCC Article 4A, into Regulation E. The Bureau does not believe it is appropriate to incorporate UCC Article 4A into Regulation E. The EFTA and the UCC generally focus on different relationships. Under EFTA section 902(b), the primary purpose of the EFTA is the provision of individual consumer rights. In contrast, UCC Article 4A is primarily intended to govern the rights and responsibilities among the commercial parties to a funds transfer, that is, the financial institution that accepts a payment order for a funds transfer and any other financial institutions that may be involved in carrying out the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consumers currently receive some protections under UCC Article 4A in the event the wire transfer is not completed, or in the event of errors in execution of the transfer, or in connection with an unauthorized transfer. Nonetheless, although consumers who request wire transfers that are remittance transfers may no longer have the protections set forth in UCC Article 4A, these consumers will receive error resolution, refund and cancellation rights and other protections for these transfers as set forth in §§ 1005.33 and 1005.34.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau does not believe it is appropriate to incorporate UCC Article 4A into Regulation E because while UCC Article 4A is a uniform code, it may be adopted differently in the various states. Incorporation of UCC Article 4A (presumably, without a similar provision as UCC Article 4A-108) on its own could have the unintended consequence of the Bureau choosing one State's version of the UCC over another. There could also be a lag between updates and revisions to the UCC among the states and the version incorporated into Regulation E, which could create confusion and potential operational conflicts for those institutions that use the same systems to send commercial and consumer wire transfers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau recognizes that one consequence of covering remittance transfers under the EFTA could be legal uncertainty under the UCC for certain remittance transfer providers. Specifically, to the extent that providers of international wire transfers were previously able to rely on UCC Article 4A's rules governing the rights and responsibilities among the parties to a wire transfer, they may no longer be able to do so. However, given the factors discussed above, the Bureau believes that the best mechanisms for resolving this uncertainty rests with the states, which can amend their respective versions of UCC Article 4A, with the purveyors of rules applicable to specific wire transfer systems, which can bind direct participants in the system, and with participants in wire transfers who can incorporate UCC Article 4A into their contracts. In addition, the Bureau recommends that Congress adopt legislation to help resolve the legal uncertainty under the UCC for remittance transfers, so parties engaged in remittance transfers will be able to continue to rely on UCC Article 4A, notwithstanding the implementation of these final rules.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The final rule will be effective one year from the date of publication of the rule in the <em data-original="E-04">Federal Register</em>. Thus, before the final rule becomes effective, states have the opportunity to amend UCC Article 4A to the extent needed or appropriate to address its application to consumer international wire transfers and wire transfer systems have the opportunity to amend their operating rules to incorporate UCC Article 4A, and participants in wire transfer transactions have the opportunity to enter into contracts incorporating UCC Article 4A. For example, the Board has recently issued a proposal to revise its Regulation J, 12 CFR part 210, to ensure the continued application of UCC Article 4A to remittance transfers carried out through Fedwire.<footnote ref="72">76 FR 64259 (Oct. 18, 2011).</footnote>
             In addition, Congress would have an opportunity to enact legislation to help resolve the legal uncertainty under the UCC for remittance transfers, so parties engaged in remittance transfers will be able to continue to rely on UCC Article 4-A, notwithstanding the implementation of these final rules. The Bureau will continue to monitor developments in this area to evaluate whether these issues are being effectively dealt with by the states, Congress or through private contractual arrangements.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Application of the EFTA; Relationship to Regulations Implementing the Bank Secrecy Act</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also recognizes that regulations issued by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to implement the Bank Secrecy Act also contain references to the EFTA. These regulations generally set certain requirements applicable to a “funds transfer” and “transmittal of funds.” The definitions of “funds transfer” and “transmittal of funds” in FinCEN's regulations exclude any funds transfers governed by the EFTA. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 31 CFR 1010.100(w) and (ddd), respectively. When EFTA section 919, as implemented by this rule, becomes effective, certain transactions that have traditionally been outside the scope of the EFTA will be governed by the EFTA, such as consumer-initiated wire transfers. The Bureau has had discussions with FinCEN about the importance of FinCEN amending its rules so that they continue to apply to remittance transfers after the effective date of this rule. The OCC also stated that it will be imperative that FinCEN act quickly to amend their rules. The Bureau does not believe, however, that it can fill the gap by incorporating FinCEN's regulations into Regulation E. The Bureau believes consolidating the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act and the EFTA in Regulation E would be impracticable under the respective authorities of two agencies.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>32(b)(2) Permanent Exception for Transfers Scheduled Before the Date of Transfer</title>
      <analysisParagraph>In the February Proposal, the Bureau proposed to use its EFTA section 904(a) and (c) authority to add a new exception, in proposed § 1005.32(b)(2), that would provide additional flexibility for remittance transfer providers to disclose estimates in pre-payment disclosures and receipts for one-time transfers or the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers scheduled to occur more than ten days after the transfer is authorized.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In the February Proposal, the Bureau noted that the market for remittance transfers scheduled in advance of the date of transfer, including preauthorized remittance transfers, is still in its nascent stages. The Bureau also noted its concern that requiring a remittance transfer provider to set exchange rates before the date of transfer might cause a provider that is already permitting consumers to schedule remittance transfers in advance of the date of transfer to stop offering a potentially useful product to consumers rather than bear or manage the increased exchange rate risk that might be associated with such a product. While remittance transfer providers (or their business partners) may be able to develop tools to manage such risk, the Bureau stated that it was concerned that providers might not do so, or that they would pass on any new risk management costs to consumers. Based on these concerns, the Bureau sought comment on whether providers should be permitted to disclose estimates of exchange rates, and related figures, in two circumstances: (i) A sender schedules a one-time transfer or the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers to occur more than ten days after the transfer is authorized; or (ii) a sender enters into an agreement for preauthorized remittance transfers where the amount of the transfers can vary and the provider does not know the exact amount of the first transfer at the time the disclosures for that transfer are given. The Bureau received comments about the use of estimates generally and conducted additional outreach to better understand some of the issues raised by commenters.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting new § 1005.32(b)(2), which permits disclosures to contain estimates in certain cases for remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer. The new provision allows for certain estimates for all remittance transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer, rather than only for one-time transfers or the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers scheduled more than ten business days before the date of the transfer (as was proposed). The allowance for estimates in disclosures for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers will have limited application, insofar as the Bureau is eliminating the requirement that pre-payment disclosures be sent prior to subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers and is only requiring pre-transfer receipts for such transfers when certain previously disclosed figures change. However, to the extent that a remittance transfer provider must send a pre-transfer receipt, the final rule permits the provider to disclose estimates in accordance with § 1005.32(b)(2). <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) (discussing pre-transfer disclosure requirements for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers). In addition, the new exception permitting estimates is expanded from the February Proposal to allow estimates in certain cases when the provider agrees to a sender's request to fix the amount to be transferred in the currency in which the remittance transfer will be received and not the currency in which it is funded. The new provisions and comments received are discussed in more detail below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Provision of Estimates for Transfers Scheduled Before the Date of Transfer</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters generally supported the first option for estimates suggested by the February Proposal: an exception from the general rule requiring accurate disclosures (§ 1005.31(f)) that would permit remittance transfer providers to disclose estimates of the amount of currency to be received, as well as other information such as exchange rates, for certain remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer. Although the February Proposal only sought comment regarding disclosure of estimates in one-time transfers and the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers scheduled more than ten business days before the date of transfer, most commenters addressed the use of estimates for all transfers scheduled before the date of transfer (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> one-time transfers scheduled before the date of transfer, the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, and subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters stated that absent an exception allowing for the disclosure of estimates, remittance transfer providers would face difficulties adjusting their risk management systems to provide accurate exchange rates before the date of transfer, particularly when providers are required to allow senders to cancel remittance transfers up to three business days before the scheduled date of transfer. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.36(c). Commenters also favored the disclosure of estimates due to the potential legal consequences associated with creating risk management strategies required in order to provide accurate (rather than estimated) disclosures far before a scheduled remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>First, multiple industry commenters argued that if remittance transfer providers were required to give accurate disclosures of the exchange rates that would apply to remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer, any providers offering such transfers would likely need to change their current methods of managing foreign exchange risk. One commenter stated that remittance transfer providers often assume the risk from fluctuations in the wholesale rates at which they buy foreign currency during the course of a day, by setting one retail exchange rate to apply to remittance transfers (or other transactions) conducted throughout that day. However, industry commenters stated that setting retail exchange rates farther before the date of transfer would cause a remittance transfer provider to incur more exchange rate risk due to the extended time period during which wholesale foreign currency markets might fluctuate. Commenters contended that in order to disclose the exchange rate that would apply to a remittance transfer far before the date of such transfer, a provider would either have to (1) bear the risk of the wholesale exchange rate changing before the date of transfer or (2) use some method to purchase currency before the date of transfer and bear the risk of the sender cancelling the transfer, leaving the provider (or its business partner) with unneeded currency.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>During outreach conversations, the Bureau spoke to industry participants to learn more about how remittance transfer providers can or do manage foreign exchange risk. In these conversations, foreign currency providers and other market participants stated that if they were required to disclose accurate exchange rates several days in advance of the date of transfer, remittance transfer providers (or their business partners) might have to develop new procedures to manage fluctuations in the wholesale foreign exchange rates, <em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> the rates at which remittance transfer providers (or their business partners) generally buy foreign currency.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Second, several industry commenters stated that remittance transfer providers would face difficulties implementing any of the methods that would allow them to manage the risk associated with disclosing exchange rates before the date of a transfer, and that these methods could result in increased prices for senders. Industry commenters indicated, and participants in outreach conducted by the Bureau further explained, that the primary method for remittance transfer providers (or their business partners) to manage any additional risk created due to the disclosure of actual exchange rates for remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer would likely be through employing foreign exchange futures or forward contracts, through which a buyer commits to buying a specified amount of foreign currency, at a specified foreign exchange rate, at a later date.<footnote ref="12">A futures contract for foreign currency is a contract between two parties to purchase a specified amount of foreign currency at a date in the future for a price agreed upon at the time of contracting. Such contracts would allow a provider to “lock-in” a rate in order for it to give customers an accurate rate when scheduling the transfer.</footnote>
             Industry commenters stated that a remittance transfer provider could itself, or through a third party, purchase a futures or a forward contract for the amount of the remittance transfer, and/or sell such a contract to the sender. One industry commenter explained, however, that such methods can be risky if foreign currency markets fluctuate and if a sender cancels a remittance transfer after the provider secures the currency needed for the transfer. In such a case, a remittance transfer provider (or its business partner) may experience a loss due to changes in the foreign exchange markets.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Third, industry commenters stated that setting exchange rates before the date of transfer could implicate other laws and regulations. For example, one trade association commenter expressed concern that for some types of entities, simply setting an exchange rate before the date of transfer might be considered a forward contract, and that therefore these entities might become subject to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulations that contain registration, capital, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements. Separately, in an outreach conversation, one bank expressed concern that restrictions on depository institutions' investments created by the Dodd-Frank Act may similarly limit depository institutions' ability to purchase the necessary contracts needed to manage the risk associated with setting far in advance the exchange rates that will apply to remittance transfers. Finally, one credit union commenter expressed concern that Federal credit union regulations might restrict credit unions' ability to manage foreign currency risk.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Fourth, apart from regulatory concerns, some industry commenters and participants in outreach suggested that requiring accurate disclosures of exchange rates far before the date of transfer would significantly increase costs. Several commenters stated that any additional efforts to provide exact exchange rates in advance would result in increased prices charged to senders (though none estimated by how much). These commenters indicated that costs could be so high that senders would not choose these products.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Fifth, an industry commenter expressed concern that any requirement to disclose an accurate exchange rate before the date of a remittance transfer would pose a significant risk to remittance transfer providers if senders decide to take advantage of the three-business-day cancellation period to seek better exchange rates. The requirements in the February Final Rule in §§ 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), 1005.33(a)(1)(iii), and 1005.36(b) that remittance transfer providers disclose the exchange rate that applies to a remittance transfer in pre-payment disclosures and receipts and that the provider must make available to the designated recipient the amount of currency stated in the disclosure means, in effect, that a remittance transfer provider must commit to a specific exchange rate at the time the sender authorizes the transfer, even if disclosed days or weeks before the date of the transfer. As a result, the commenter stated some senders might use the three-day cancellation period applicable to transfers scheduled before the date of transfer strategically in order to seek better exchange rates. Thus, if prior to expiration of the cancellation period, the remittance transfer provider offered an exchange rate that was more favorable to the sender than the exchange rate set for the transfer, the commenter felt that a sender might decide to cancel the remittance transfer and immediately rebook it at the more favorable exchange rate available that day. Conversely, if the provider offered an exchange rate that was less favorable than the earlier rate, the sender would benefit from having locked in a better rate that the remittance transfer provider was contractually bound to apply to the transfer. The commenter stated that this phenomenon would increase providers' exchange rate risk and the cost of managing such risk. Some industry commenters indicated that, at least in some instances, providers would refuse to offer consumers the ability to schedule remittance transfers before the date of transfer if the Bureau required providers to disclose, before the cancellation deadline passes, the exchange rate that will apply to any such remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters agreed that the use of estimates in disclosures may be appropriate for initial transfers in series of preauthorized remittance transfers, but stated that, if remittance transfer providers were allowed to use estimates in disclosures for such transfers, senders should be informed they would not receive actual notice of the price of the transfer or of the amount to be received by the designated recipient during the periods when the senders can cancel the transfers. Some of these commenters also stated that if remittance transfer providers were permitted to use estimates for transfers scheduled before the date of transfer, then providers should also be required to ensure that senders eventually receive disclosures that state the actual exchange rates that will apply to the remittance transfers prior to the expiration of the cancellation periods for those transfers, or the providers should be required to commit to the method they will use to set the exchange rate on the date of transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, an individual commenter and several industry commenters stated that disallowing estimates would disproportionately harm smaller remittance transfer providers. The individual commenter suggested that small providers would not have the scale or expertise to manage exchange rate risk in a manner necessary to comply with any requirement that providers disclose accurate exchange rates before the date of transfer. Relatedly, industry commenters stated that not allowing estimates for disclosures provided prior to the date of a remittance transfer would disproportionately affect small providers relative to large providers. Similarly, several industry commenters urged the Bureau to allow estimates because without estimates they would not be able to manage risk and thus would have no reliable way of providing accurate disclosures before the date of transfer of the exchange rate and related figures. If the February Final Rule remained unchanged, these providers stated they would not permit consumers to schedule transfers before the date of transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Based on comments received and the Bureau's outreach and further analysis, and in order to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it necessary and proper to use its EFTA section 904(a) and (c) authority to adopt proposed § 1005.32(b)(2) with the changes discussed in more detail below concerning (i) when estimates will be allowed under this provision and (ii) situations where the amount to be transferred may vary.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau continues to believe that the market for remittance transfers scheduled significantly before of the date of transfer, including preauthorized remittance transfers, is currently limited. Nevertheless, the Bureau believes that if it did not adopt this provision to allow estimates, the subset of remittance transfers providers that currently offer senders the ability to schedule remittance transfers before the date of transfer—or are considering doing so—may limit such offerings because the providers (or their business partners) would not want to absorb or manage the risk associated with fixing the exchange rates that would apply to transfers far in advance of the date of transfer. As described above, many retail exchange rates are set through reference to wholesale currency markets in which rates can fluctuate frequently. As a result, whenever there are time lags between when the retail rate applied to a transfer is set, when the relevant foreign currency is purchased, and when funds are delivered, a remittance transfer provider (and/or its business partner) may face losses due to unexpected changes in the value of the relevant foreign currency. Generally, this risk may increase the more time that elapses between these events.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is concerned that in many cases, remittance transfer providers (or their business partners) will find it more difficult or costly to manage the risks related to disclosing accurate exchange rates before the date of transfer and that such risks may be exacerbated because the final rule allows senders to cancel transfers up to three business days before the date of transfer. The Bureau is also concerned that, because remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer are a relatively small portion of the remittance transfer market, providers may decide not to develop necessary risk management tools and may not offer transfers scheduled before the date of transfer. The Bureau further believes that for such transactions, allowing estimates may be beneficial to senders in many instances even though senders may receive less information before the date of transfer than they would under the February Final Rule. If senders received exchange rates set long before the dates of remittance transfers, in some cases, senders would receive a more favorable exchange rate than they would otherwise, while other senders would receive less favorable rates, depending on the fluctuation of the exchange rate between the date of disclosure and the date of transfer. However, allowing estimates may result in lower costs for remittance transfer providers (and thus lower prices for all senders of transfers scheduled before the date of transfer), as well as wider access for senders to the convenience of one-time transfers scheduled before the date of transfer and preauthorized remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, while under § 1005.32(b)(2) senders will not always receive disclosures of a fixed exchange rate and amount of currency to be received, the Bureau believes that even estimates of these amounts will still permit consumers to learn some information that could assist in comparing remittance transfer providers' price models. As is discussed below (<em data-original="E-03">see</em> § 1005.32(d)) estimates provided pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2) must be based on the exchange rate or, where applicable, the estimated exchange rate based on an estimation methodology permitted under § 1005.32(c) that the provider would have used or did use that day in providing disclosures to a sender requesting such a remittance transfer to be made on the same day.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Time Period for Estimates for Transfers Scheduled Before the Date of Transfer</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.32(b)(2)(i) stated that estimates could be provided for certain items required in the pre-payment disclosure, receipt, or combined disclosure if a remittance transfer was requested or authorized by the sender more than ten days before the date of transfer. The Bureau sought comment on whether ten days is an appropriate period after which estimates should no longer be permitted or whether the period should be longer or shorter.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received a number of comments on the appropriate period for use of estimates in disclosures provided for all remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer (rather than just one-time transfers scheduled before the date of transfer and first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers as covered by the February Proposal). Industry commenters supported estimates in disclosures for all remittance transfers scheduled more than ten days before the date of transfer, but many also urged the Bureau to allow estimates for remittance transfers scheduled ten or less days before for many of the reasons discussed above—namely the risk management and other challenges that they believed that remittance transfer providers would face if they were required to disclose exchange rates far in advance of remittance transfers. These commenters urged a shorter period within which they would not be permitted to provide estimated disclosures. Commenters also expressed concern that providers would refuse to offer consumers the ability to schedule transfers ten or fewer days before the date of transfer because providers would not want to disclose exact exchange rates between one and ten days before the date of transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters suggested a range of alternatives less than ten days. One industry commenter proposed allowing estimates for all transfers scheduled more than one day before the date of transfer because it was unable to manage the risks associated with providing accurate exchange rates more than one day in advance. Other industry commenters provided similar rationales for proposed periods of less than two days, two or three days, five days, and seven days. One trade group commenter urged the Bureau to allow estimates for all remittance transfers scheduled two or more days before the date of transfer and to require only a two-day cancellation period because a shorter cancellation period would still allow senders to cancel transfers and would exacerbate providers' foreign currency risks.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consumer group commenters favored the ten-day rule expressed in the February Proposal. One of these commenters explained that although it understood the difficulty of disclosing the actual exchange rate before the date of transfer, its research showed that consumers are better informed when they receive accurate and precise disclosures, and thus this commenter preferred to expand the period during which estimates would not permitted.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting a revised § 1005.32(b)(2)(i), which permits remittance transfer providers to estimate exchange rates and, in some instances fees and taxes, for all remittance transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer, rather than for one-time transfers or the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers scheduled more than ten days before the date of transfer as proposed. As is explained above regarding the use of estimates generally, compared to the proposal permitting estimates in some cases more than ten days before the date of transfer, the Bureau believes this provision will allow providers increased flexibility to continue to offer transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer while still requiring accurate disclosures for transfers scheduled less than five days before the date of transfer (except when estimates are permitted by § 1005.32(a) or (b)(1)).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau recognizes that for transfers scheduled three or four business days before the date of transfer, providers will have to disclose an accurate exchange rate (rather than an estimate) while maintaining the sender's right to cancel the transfer. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.36(c). The Bureau believes, however, that as compared to transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer, risk management needs are reduced for transfers scheduled less than five business days before the date of transfer. The Bureau believes that providers should not be permitted to use provide estimates, other than as permitted under § 1005.32(a) and (b)(1), for transfers scheduled less than five business days before the date of transfer. Because risk is generally more manageable closer to the date of transfer, the Bureau believes consumers should receive accurate disclosures during that period. To the extent that any remittance transfer providers that currently offer, or plan to offer, remittance transfers scheduled in advance may be inclined to limit senders' ability to schedule transfers three or four business days before the date of transfer (because they are unwilling or unable to provide an accurate exchange rate while cancellation remains possible), the Bureau believes there is a limited loss of convenience to consumers as compared to a scenario where estimates are disallowed for a longer period. The Bureau presumes that any consumer has the option of a same-day transfer with a remittance transfer provider who does not offer two, three, or four days advance scheduling.
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Thus, in the final rule, § 1005.32(b)(2)(i) provides that estimates may be provided in certain cases for the amounts to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) through (vii) if a remittance transfer is scheduled by a sender five or more business days before the date of transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed revisions to comment 32-1 to explained when the proposed § 1005.32(b)(2) exception would apply. The Bureau is revising proposed comment 32-1 to clarify that § 1005.32(b)(2) permits estimates to be used for certain information if the remittance transfer is scheduled by a sender five or more business days before the date of the transfer, for disclosures described in § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) and (a)(2)(i). Section 1005.36(a)(1)(i) and (a)(2)(i) concern pre-payment disclosures and receipts for one-time transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer and preauthorized remittance transfers and are discussed in detail below.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Estimates of the Amount To Be Transferred</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also sought comment on whether remittance transfer providers should be allowed flexibility to estimate certain information in disclosures for the first scheduled transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers where the exact amount of the transfer can vary. The few commenters on this issue suggested that the need to estimate the amount to be transferred could occur in two scenarios. For example, an industry commenter suggested that senders may want to transfer a variable amount (such as a paycheck or government benefits payment in an amount that varies), or may want to prearrange the delivery of a fixed amount of one currency from an account denominated in another currency, <em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> U.S. dollars (which would result in the transfer amount depending on the exchange rate). The Bureau believes it unnecessary to adjust the rule expressly to address the first potential scenario. No industry commenter stated that it currently allows customers to schedule transfers of a variable amount, and the Bureau is not aware of business models permitting such remittance transfers. Under the final rule, § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) requires a receipt to be provided a reasonable time prior to a subsequent preauthorized transfer if the amount to be transferred changes from the first transfer in series a of preauthorized remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As to the latter scenario, outreach confirmed that the marketplace currently permits some consumers to schedule series of recurring remittance transfers in which the transfer amount is fixed in a currency other than that in which the transfer is funded. To address this latter scenario, the Bureau believes it necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and to facilitate compliance to exercise its EFTA section 904(a) and (c) authority to adopt an additional revision to § 1005.32(b)(2). Specifically, the final rule states in § 1005.32(b)(2)(i) that if, at the time the sender schedules a transfer, the remittance transfer provider agrees to a sender's request to fix the amount to be transferred in the currency in which the remittance transfer will be received and not the currency in which it is funded, estimates may also be provided for the amounts to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(i) through (iii), except as provided in § 1005.32(b)(2)(iii) (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> in certain cases the provider can disclose estimates of the fees and taxes imposed on the transaction and the total amount of the transaction, as well as the amount that will be transferred in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 32(b)(2)-1 provides an example regarding the exception for remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer in which the amount to be transferred is fixed in a currency other than that in which the transfer is funded.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 32(b)(2)-2 clarifies the interaction between the final rule and § 1005.10(d) of subpart A of Regulation E.<footnote ref="13">Section 1005.10(d)(1) states: “ &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Notice.&lt;/em&gt; When a preauthorized electronic fund transfer from the consumer's account will vary in amount from the previous transfer under the same authorization or from the preauthorized amount, the designated payee or the financial institution shall send the consumer written notice of the amount and date of the transfer at least 10 days before the scheduled date of the transfer.”</footnote>
             It states that to the extent § 1005.10(d) requires, for an electronic fund transfer that is also a remittance transfer, notice when a preauthorized electronic fund transfer from the consumer's account will vary in amount from the previous transfer under the same authorization or from the preauthorized amount, that provision applies even if subpart B would not otherwise require notice before the date of transfer. However, insofar as § 1005.10(d) does not specify the form of such notice, a notice sent pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) will satisfy § 1005.10(d) as long as the timing requirements of § 1005.10(d) are satisfied.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Relatedly, the Bureau solicited comment as to whether a remittance transfer provider should be permitted to estimate the date in the foreign country on which the funds will be available, if the amount of the transfers under the preauthorized remittance transfer arrangement varies from one transfer to the next, and the remittance transfer provider does not know the exact date on which the remittance transfer must be sent at the time that disclosures are given for the first transfer. 77 FR 6310, 6318 (suggesting that this situation could arise, for example, if remittance transfers are being used to pay bills with due dates that are not known in advance). No comments were received on this issue. The Bureau is not adopting any changes to the February Final Rule regarding estimates of the date on which funds will be available.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>18(b) Pre-Acquisition Disclosure Requirements</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Overview of the Final Rule's Pre-Acquisition Disclosure Regime for Prepaid Accounts</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The final rule requires that new disclosures for prepaid accounts be provided to consumers before they acquire a prepaid account. The Bureau believes that providing these disclosures pre-acquisition will ensure that all consumers, regardless of the type of prepaid account they are acquiring, receive relevant information to better inform their decision before they have committed themselves to a particular account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The new disclosure regime for prepaid accounts requires a financial institution to provide a consumer with both a “short form” and a “long form” disclosure pre-acquisition. The short form sets forth the prepaid account's most important fees and certain other information to facilitate consumer understanding of the account's key terms and aid comparison shopping among prepaid account programs.<footnote ref="359">The final rule also requires pre-acquisition disclosure of certain information outside but in close proximity to the short form disclosure. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; final § 1005.18(b)(5).</footnote>
             The long form disclosure, on the other hand, provides the consumer with a comprehensive list of all of the fees associated with the prepaid account and detailed information on how those fees are assessed, as well as certain other information about the prepaid account program. The long form provides consumers an opportunity to review all fee information about a prepaid account before acquiring it. In sum, the short form provides a snapshot of key fees and information, while its companion disclosure, the long form, provides an unabridged, straightforward list of fees and greater detail regarding use of the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau understands that there are many methods through which a consumer can acquire a prepaid account, and it has designed the final rule's disclosure regime to be adaptable to all these methods. For example, a consumer might purchase a prepaid account at retail, online through a financial institution's Web site (or the Web site of a service provider such as a program manager), or by telephoning the financial institution (or program manager). An employee might receive a payroll card account from an employer, or a student might receive a prepaid account from his or her university in connection with the disbursement of financial aid. A government benefit recipient might receive benefit payments on a government benefit card distributed by the agency responsible for administering those benefits, or an insurance company might distribute prepaid cards to consumers to disburse property or casualty insurance proceeds.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has tailored the final rule to accommodate these varied methods while maintaining the overall integrity of the required disclosures. This tailoring includes permitting special formatting for prepaid disclosures delivered electronically; permitting disclosure of discounts and waivers for the periodic fee; permitting information within the short form disclosure for payroll card accounts (and government benefit accounts) directing consumers to sources of information regarding State-required information and other fee discounts and waivers; and accommodating disclosure of fees for optional services as well as those charged on non-traditional prepaid accounts, such as digital wallets, via a requirement to disclose certain information about additional types of fees not otherwise disclosed on the short form. The Bureau believes that creating a generally consistent and comprehensive disclosure regime that applies before the consumer's acquisition of a prepaid account will ensure that any consumer who obtains a prepaid account, regardless of the type of prepaid account or its method of acquisition, will receive relevant information at an opportune time in the acquisition sequence to better inform his or her purchase and use decisions.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The content and structure of the short form and long form disclosures set forth in the final rule largely mirror that of the proposed rule, although the Bureau has refined various elements and reorganized the disclosure provisions in the final rule to simplify the structure and aid compliance. See the individual section-by-section analyses below under this § 1005.18(b) for a more detailed discussion of each aspect of the final pre-acquisition disclosure regime. The following provides a summary of the key provisions in the final rule's pre-acquisition disclosure regime.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">The short form disclosure.</em> The short form disclosure, designed to provide a snapshot of key fees and information for a prepaid account, features a section for fees and a section for certain other information. The fee section must appear in the form of a table, and consists of two parts. The first part contains “static” fees, setting forth standardized fee disclosures that must be provided for all prepaid account programs, even if such fees are $0 or if they relate to features not offered by a particular program. The second part provides information about some additional types of fees that may be charged for that prepaid account program.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Specifically, the static portion of the short form fee disclosures features a “top line” component highlighting four types of fees at the top of the form: The periodic fee, the per purchase fee, ATM withdrawal fees (parsed out for both in- and out-of-network withdrawals in the United States), and the cash reload fee. As discussed in more detail in part III.A above, the Bureau believes these fees are the most important to consumers when shopping for a prepaid account. For this reason, the top line is designed to quickly draw the attention of consumers through its dominant location and use of larger and more prominent type than that used for the remainder of the disclosures on the short form. Located just below the top line are disclosures for three other types of fees: ATM balance inquiry fees (parsed out for both in- and out-of-network balance inquiries in the United States), customer service fees (parsed out for both live and automated customer service), and the inactivity fee. While the final rule generally prohibits disclosure of third-party fees, the final rule requires that the cash reload fee disclosed in the top line include third-party fees.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The static fees are followed by a portion of the disclosure that addresses additional types of fees specific to that prepaid account program. For the final rule, the Bureau has brought together the proposed statement disclosing the number of “other fees” not listed on the short form disclosure and the proposed disclosure of “incidence-based fees” into a common category referred to as “additional fee types” and located these disclosures together on the short form immediately following the static fee disclosures. First, the final rule requires a statement disclosing the number of additional fee types the financial institution may charge consumers with respect to the prepaid account (the proposal would have required disclosure of the total number of individual fees rather than fee types). Second, the final rule requires a statement explaining to consumers that what follows are examples of some of those additional fee types.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Next, the two additional fee types that generate the highest revenue from consumers above a de minimis threshold must be disclosed. These fee types must be calculated for the prepaid account program or across prepaid account programs that share the same fee schedule. In general, financial institutions must assess their additional fee types every 24 months and, if necessary, update their disclosures. There is an exception to this requirement, however, such that financial institutions are not required to pull and replace disclosures provided on, in, or with prepaid account packaging material if there is a change in the additional fee types required to be listed. (Under the proposal, this disclosure would have been based on incidence rather than revenue, would have been three fees rather than two, and updating would have been required every 12 rather than 24 months. The de minimis threshold and assessment across programs that share the same fee schedule are also new to the final rule.) The final rule also contains additional flexibility regarding the timing for reassessments, voluntary disclosures of additional fee types in certain circumstances, and disclosure of fee variations within additional fee types.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The final, non-fee section of the short form is comprised of a series of statements containing certain other key information regarding the prepaid account. The final rule generally requires disclosure of the highest fee when the price of a service or feature may vary and permits use of a symbol, such as an asterisk, to indicate that those fees may vary; the statement linked to that asterisk must appear below the fee disclosures. The final rule also permits use of a different symbol, such as a dagger, to provide specific information about waivers or discounts for the periodic fee only. Next is a statement indicating whether an overdraft credit feature may be offered in connection with the prepaid account and, if so, an explanation that the feature may be offered after a certain number of days and that fees would apply. In contrast to the proposal, the final rule requires disclosure both when a prepaid account is set up to be eligible for FDIC or NCUA insurance and when it is not, and combines this statement with the call to action for the consumer to register the account, if applicable. The final rule requires disclosure of the URL for a Bureau Web site from which consumers can obtain general information on prepaid accounts. The short form disclosure concludes with a statement directing consumers to where they can obtain information on all fees and services for that particular prepaid account program. The Bureau has incorporated into the regulatory text of the final rule specific language for each of these statements rather than referencing the model forms for such language.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Short form disclosures for payroll card accounts (and government benefit accounts).</em> The final rule contains an additional requirement and an additional accommodation for short form disclosures for payroll card accounts (and government benefit accounts). For these accounts, like in the proposal, financial institutions are required to include a statement regarding alternate wage (or benefits) payment options above the top-line fee disclosures. The final rule permits financial institutions to choose between two different statements to make this disclosure. The first statement simply informs consumers that they do not have to accept the card and directs them to ask about other ways to receive their wages. The alternative statement informs consumers that they have several options to receive their wages, followed by a list of those options, and directs them to tell their employer which option they choose. The final rule also permits financial institutions to include an optional line in the informational statements portion of the short form disclosure for these accounts directing consumers to a particular location outside the short form for State-required information and other fee discounts and waivers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Short form disclosures for multiple service plans.</em> The final rule permits financial institutions offering prepaid account programs with multiple service plans to use a short form disclosure specifically tailored for these products. The Bureau has redesigned the multiple service plan short form to be more simple and clear, incorporating a multi-columned structure for displaying all short form fees across all plans.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Additional disclosures outside the short form.</em> The final rule requires that the following information be disclosed outside but in close proximity to the short form: The name of the financial institution; the name of the prepaid account program; and the purchase price and activation fee, if any.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">The long form disclosure.</em> The long form disclosure is the second part of the pre-acquisition disclosure regime for prepaid accounts and complements the short form disclosure. It sets forth in a table all of the prepaid account's fees and their qualifying conditions as well as other information about the prepaid account program. Similar to the short form, the long form also contains a series of statements following the fee table containing certain other key information regarding the prepaid account. First is a statement regarding registration and FDIC or NCUA insurance eligibility that mirrors the statement required for the short form, together with an explanation of the benefit of FDIC or NCUA insurance coverage or the consequence of the lack of such coverage. Next is a statement indicating whether an overdraft credit feature may be offered in connection with the prepaid account and, if so, an explanation that the feature may be offered after a certain number of days and that fees would apply; this statement also mirrors the one required in the short form disclosure. The final rule also requires contact information for the financial institution; the URL of a Bureau Web site where the consumer can obtain general information on prepaid accounts; and the Bureau Web site URL and telephone number to submit a complaint about a prepaid account. Finally, the long form must include certain Regulation Z disclosures if, at any point, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in Regulation Z § 1026.61 may be offered in connection with the prepaid account. The final rule provides a safe harbor for financial institutions from having to reprint the long form disclosure due to changes in third-party fees or the Regulation Z disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Form and format of the disclosures.</em> The final rule contains detailed provisions addressing the form and formatting of the short form and long form disclosures. These provisions reflect the changes to the multiple service plan short form design, discussed above, as well as several additional exceptions to the general retainability requirement for the pre-acquisition disclosures and clarification regarding how certain requirements apply to electronic disclosures (including how to comply with the requirement that electronic disclosures be viewable across all screen sizes). The final rule contains additional formatting requirements to address new disclosure elements added to the final rule, including several optional elements discussed above. The final rule also contains a provision requiring that fee names and other terms be used consistently within and across the short form and long form disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Model and sample disclosure forms.</em> The final rule contains five model form variations for the short form disclosure: Two iterations of the short form disclosures generally, one for payroll card accounts, one for government benefit accounts, and one for prepaid account programs with multiple service plans. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> Model Forms A-10(a) through (e). The final rule also contains a sample long form disclosure. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> Sample Form A-10(f). The model forms provide a safe harbor to financial institutions that use them (provided that the model forms are used accurately and appropriately), unlike the sample form which serves only as an example. Whether a financial institution chooses to use a model form for its short form disclosure or design its long form disclosure based on the long form, the financial institution must of course tailor its disclosures for the specific prepaid account program in order to comply with the requirements of § 1005.18(b).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For the convenience of the prepaid industry and to help reduce development costs, the Bureau is also providing native design files for print and source code for Web-based disclosures for all of the model and sample forms included in the final rule. These files are available at <em data-original="E-03">www.consumerfinance.gov/prepaid-disclosure-files</em>.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Timing requirements for pre-acquisition disclosures generally and the alternative timing regime for prepaid accounts acquired at retail locations and orally by telephone.</em> The final rule generally requires that the disclosures required by § 1005.18(b) be provided before a consumer acquires a prepaid account. Commentary to the final rule explains that a consumer acquires a prepaid account by purchasing, opening, or choosing to be paid via a prepaid account, and includes several examples.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consistent with the proposal, the final rule also provides special rules for situations in which a consumer acquires a prepaid account at retail or orally by telephone. In these situations, a financial institution must provide the short form disclosure to the consumer prior to acquisition and must provide methods for consumers to access the long form by telephone and via a Web site prior to acquisition. If these conditions are met, the financial institution does not need to provide the long form in writing until after acquisition. The Bureau has expanded this exception in the final rule to cover all retail locations (rather than just retail stores) that sell prepaid accounts in person, without regard to whether the location is operated by a financial institution's agent. A financial institution selling its own prepaid accounts in its own branches does not qualify for the retail location exception with respect to those prepaid accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Prepaid accounts acquired in foreign languages.</em> A financial institution must provide the pre-acquisition disclosures in a foreign language if the financial institution uses that same foreign language in connection with the acquisition of a prepaid account in certain circumstances. Unlike the proposal, the final rule does not require a financial institution to provide pre-acquisition disclosures in a foreign language if an employee of the financial institution or a third party uses that foreign language in person with the consumer. The financial institution also must provide the long form disclosure in English upon a consumer's request and on its Web site.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Background and the Bureau's Proposed Pre-Acquisition Disclosure Regime for Prepaid Accounts</title>
        <analysisParagraph>EFTA section 905(a) sets forth disclosure requirements for accounts subject to the Act. The relevant portion of EFTA section 905 states that the terms and conditions of EFTs involving a consumer's account shall be disclosed at the time the consumer contracts for an EFT service, in accordance with regulations of the Bureau. Section 905(a) further states that the disclosures must include, among other things and to the extent applicable, any charges for EFTs or for the right to make such transfers,<footnote ref="360">EFTA section 905(a)(4).</footnote>
             that a fee may be imposed for use of certain ATMs,<footnote ref="361">EFTA section 905(a)(10).</footnote>
             information regarding the type and nature of EFTs that the consumer can initiate,<footnote ref="362">EFTA section 905(a)(3).</footnote>

             The implementing regulation for this provision, § 1005.7, further elaborates that the required disclosures must be provided to a consumer at the time a consumer contracts for an EFT or before the first EFT is made involving the consumer's account. However, while EFTA section 905(a) and § 1005.7(b) mandate the inclusion of several specific items, they do not specify a particular format for the disclosures.<footnote ref="364">Specifically, section 905(a) and § 1005.7(b) generally require disclosure of details regarding the types of EFTs that the consumer may make (including limitations on the frequency and dollar amount of the transfers), any fees imposed by the financial institution for EFTs or for the right to make transfers, and a notice that a fee may be imposed by an ATM operator when the consumer initiates an EFT or makes a balance inquiry, among other requirements.</footnote>
             At various points, these general provisions in § 1005.7 have been modified for use with other types of accounts or in other contexts.<footnote ref="365">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See generally&lt;/em&gt; § 1005.14(b)(1) (disclosures provided by certain service providers), 61 FR 19662, 19674 (May 2, 1996); existing § 1005.15(d) (disclosures related to the EFT of government benefits), 61 FR 19662, 19670 (May 2, 1996); § 1005.16 (disclosures at ATMs), 78 FR 18221, 18224 (Mar. 26, 2013); § 1005.17(d) (overdraft disclosures), 74 FR 59033, 59053 (Nov. 17, 2009); existing § 1005.18(c)(1) (payroll card account disclosures), 71 FR 51437, 51449 (Aug. 30, 2006); and § 1005.31 (disclosures related to remittance transfers), 77 FR 50244, 50285 (Aug. 20, 2012).</footnote>

        <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.18(b) of the final rule implements, in part, EFTA section 905(a) for prepaid accounts. In addition, pursuant to its authority under EFTA sections 904(a), (b), and (c) and 905(a), and section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Bureau is requiring financial institutions to provide disclosures prior to the time a consumer acquires a prepaid account and for disclosures to include all fees that may be charged for the prepaid account. Also, the Bureau is requiring that in certain circumstances financial institutions provide disclosures in languages other than English.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed a new pre-acquisition disclosure regime for prepaid accounts, separate from the general requirements under § 1005.7, for several reasons. First, the Bureau was concerned that providing core pricing and usage information at the time the contract is formed or prior to the first EFT would be too late for many consumers to make informed acquisition decisions. As the Bureau explained in the proposal, for instance, the Bureau understood based on its outreach that many financial institutions were providing only limited fee information on the outside of packaging for GPR cards, so that consumers would have to purchase the card to access comprehensive information about the card's fees and terms. Similarly, the Bureau was concerned about the acquisition process for payroll card accounts, where new employees often receive account terms and conditions documents at the same time they received large quantities of other benefits-related paperwork, and about the sequencing of account disclosures in an online environment.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Second, the Bureau believed that it was important to provide specific formatting information that would ensure substantial consistency to facilitate consumers' comparison and selection process across a range of acquisition channels and carefully balance concerns about information overload. The Bureau therefore designed and developed its proposed pre-acquisition disclosures for prepaid accounts over the course of several years through a process that included consumer testing conducted both prior to and after the publication of the proposal and feedback from stakeholders in direct meetings, comments responding to the Prepaid ANPR, and follow up to a blog post of prototype disclosure designs.<footnote ref="366">Eric Goldberg, &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Prepaid cards: Help design a new disclosure,&lt;/em&gt; CFPB Blog Post, (Mar. 18, 2014), &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;http://www.consumerfinance.gov/blog/prepaid-cards-help-design-a-new-disclosure/&lt;/em&gt;.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The majority of both industry and consumer groups agreed that it was important for consumers to receive disclosures before they purchase a prepaid account. Industry and consumer groups encouraged the Bureau to develop disclosures to accommodate the variety of distribution channels through which prepaid products are distributed and sold, while also considering how distribution may evolve in the future. The majority also strongly supported standardized disclosures, instead of a more general rule requiring only that fees be disclosed clearly and conspicuously without providing specific instructions or model forms. However, industry mostly advocated that on-package disclosures should include only the fees that a consumer would most commonly incur while using a prepaid account, in order to increase the likelihood that consumers would understand and use the disclosures. On the other hand, many consumer groups urged provision of a full disclosure to the consumer of all fees associated with a GPR card, voicing concern that consumers would not get a full understanding of a prepaid account's true costs without comprehensive fee information and that providers could subvert a limited scope disclosure by adjusting fee schedules to increase or add fees not required to be disclosed on a shorter disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>To balance such concerns, the Bureau proposed to require financial institutions to provide both a short form and a long form disclosure, as generally described above, prior to the time the consumer acquires a prepaid account. The proposed short form focused on the fees charged most frequently across most types of prepaid account programs, as well as providing limited information about the three fees incurred most frequently by users of the particular program. The short form thus would have provided largely consistent information for purposes of comparison, while also providing certain unique information about other fees that were charged most frequently to consumers (so-called “incidence-based fees”) and other cues encouraging the consumer to consult the long form for more detailed and comprehensive information. The Bureau also proposed to require that financial institutions provide the disclosures in languages other than English in certain circumstances.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Specifically, proposed § 1005.18(b)(2) would have set forth the substantive requirements for the Bureau's proposed prepaid account pre-acquisition disclosure regime, with content requirements for the short form disclosures addressed by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i), content requirements for the long form disclosure addressed by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii), and form and formatting requirements for both disclosures addressed by proposed § 1005.18(b)(3) and (4), respectively.<footnote ref="367">As discussed in detail below, the final rule addresses these requirements in § 1005.18(b)(2) and (4) and § 1005.18(b)(6) and (7), respectively.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Depending on the structure of a particular prepaid account, however, the Bureau recognized that the proposed short form may not capture all of a particular prepaid account's fees or explain the conditions under which a financial institution might impose those fees. The Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing indicated that when participants were shown prototype short forms, most understood that they represented only a subset of fee information and that they could potentially be charged fees not shown on the form.<footnote ref="368">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report I at 9.</footnote>
             Further, except in certain retail stores or with respect to accounts acquired orally by telephone, under the proposed pre-acquisition disclosure regime, a consumer would have received a long form disclosure simultaneously with the short form and therefore have the opportunity to see all fees associated with a prepaid account and any relevant conditions before acquiring a prepaid account. In addition, in pre-proposal testing, most participants did not identify any additional fees that they would have wanted to see listed in a short form.<footnote ref="369">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See id.&lt;/em&gt; at 6-8.</footnote>
             The Bureau believed that the proposed short form contained most fees that might be charged in connection with a prepaid account and the fees listed are those that are most important for a consumer to know in advance of acquiring a prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also recognized that disclosing even this proposed subset of fee information on the short form ran the same risk of information overload that the Bureau believed could occur if all fees were disclosed to a consumer instead of just a subset of fees. The Bureau believed, however, based on its pre-proposal consumer testing and other research, that incorporating elements of visual hierarchy would mitigate these risks. Most importantly, the fee types that would have been disclosed pursuant to proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(<em data-original="E-03">1</em>) through (<em data-original="E-03">4</em>) in the top line of the short form would have used font size and other elements to promote readability.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>General Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau sought comment on its proposed overall approach to the pre-acquisition disclosure regime. Discussed in this section are the comments provided in response as well as certain other general comments received. Comments regarding particular aspects of the proposed pre-acquisition disclosure regime are addressed in the applicable section-by-section analyses below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several State government agencies, a majority of consumer groups, and a substantial number of industry commenters (including trade associations, a credit union, and a program manager) expressed general support for the proposed pre-acquisition regime, although most also offered criticisms and recommendations for change of some individual elements. The credit union and industry trade associations complimented the Bureau on the proposed pre-acquisition disclosures, with some commenters calling the short form disclosure an elegant and smart solution that would give consumers a clear, simple, and consumer friendly way to review critical data when shopping for prepaid accounts. Consumer groups and individual consumers who submitted comments as part of a comment submission campaign organized by a national consumer advocacy group also strongly supported the design and content of the proposed short form and long form disclosures as essential to protecting consumers. In particular, the consumer groups praised the short form disclosure's clear standardized form, saying it provides a good balance between simplicity and completeness.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Most industry commenters offered specific criticisms of or recommended changes to specific elements of the proposed pre-acquisition disclosure regime. Industry commenters' more general criticisms of the proposed disclosures included both that the amount of information in the short form disclosure would be overwhelming to consumers (and thus certain aspects should be eliminated, such as the disclosure of the number of additional fees, incidence-based fees, or any incidental fees that are excluded from the disclosure requirements of Regulation DD) and that the short form failed to provide certain information that the commenters believed to be meaningful to consumers' purchase decisions (such as disclosure of fee waivers and discounts instead of disclosure of the highest fee as proposed) and thus that additional information should be added.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>More globally, one academic group and several industry commenters (including program managers, a credit union, and a regional credit union trade association) urged the Bureau to eliminate both the short form and long form disclosures. These commenters said variously that the proposed disclosures would overwhelm consumers, burden industry without commensurate benefits to consumers, or duplicate the initial disclosures already required by Regulation E. They also asserted that research by the Bureau and others indicated that few consumers engage in formal comparison shopping among prepaid accounts or that consumers lack the financial literacy or inclination to read disclosures (and thus, the Bureau's efforts to facilitate comparison shopping are unnecessary). One of the program managers and the academic group asserted that the highly competitive prepaid marketplace, which in their view had already produced lower fees and simpler fee structures, was sufficient to meet the evolving needs of consumers. Industry commenters expressed concern regarding the burden they felt the proposed disclosures would impose; the program manager elaborated that the proposed disclosure regime would require expensive and time-consuming redesign of disclosures and changes in packaging, manufacturing processes, and distribution.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A number of other industry commenters and a group of members of Congress opposed one, but not both, of the proposed pre-acquisition disclosures. A few industry commenters (including an issuing credit union, a credit union association, and a program manager) recommended eliminating the short form disclosure in favor of the long form disclosure. A larger group (including trade associations, issuing banks, credit unions, program managers, a law firm writing on behalf of a coalition of prepaid issuers, and the group of members of Congress) recommended eliminating the long form disclosure in favor of the short form—or at least that the long form not be required to be provided pre-acquisition or only be required to be provided online, over the telephone, or upon request. As a whole, both groups of commenters asserted that requiring both of the proposed disclosures would result in too many disclosures (the short form and long form, prepaid account agreement containing initial disclosures, and State-required disclosures for payroll card accounts), resulting in high compliance costs and disclosure fatigue for consumers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The industry commenters recommending elimination of the short form asserted that it was redundant of the long form, which they argued would be sufficient alone by virtue of it providing a complete disclosure of fees. The program manager recommended combining the short form and the long form to create a single comprehensive pre-acquisition disclosure. The industry commenters critical of the long form variously asserted that it was redundant of the short form and other disclosures required by Regulation E before a consumer can use the prepaid card (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> initial disclosures) and State-required disclosures for some payroll card accounts; inferior to the short form, which would provide the most pertinent and common fees; and would overload and confuse consumers with its comprehensive information and therefore not contribute to consumer purchase decisions. An issuing bank, a program manager, a trade association, and a group of members of Congress recommended against requiring the long form, arguing that the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing indicated consumers would not use it to make pre-acquisition decisions. Several industry commenters opposed required disclosure of optional incidental services that are not available at the time of purchase; rather, they suggested those fees should not have to be disclosed until such services are accepted by the consumer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A number of industry commenters and a State government agency recommended that the Bureau eliminate the proposed short form disclosure requirement for payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts or, alternatively, treat the short form disclosure for these accounts differently from those for GPR cards. Some of these commenters said otherwise these disclosures would be burdensome for financial institutions providing payroll (and government benefit) cards for a number of reasons. They said the proposed disclosures were, in their opinion, duplicative of the initial disclosures required by § 1005.7(b) and that the differences between payroll card accounts (and government benefit accounts) and GPR cards militate against requiring a short form disclosure for the former. They said that, compared to GPR cards, these accounts have fewer fees, features, and conditions, and the statement regarding registration and many specific fees listed in the static portion of the proposed short form are inapplicable. They also pointed to State-required disclosure of certain fee discounts and waivers for these accounts as another distinguishing factor from GPR cards. Some commenters said the proposed disclosures were inapt for payroll card accounts (and government benefit accounts) as there are not the same space constraints as there are for GPR cards sold at retail and, further, consumers cannot comparison shop for these kinds of accounts. Finally, some commenters requested that the Bureau eliminate the long form disclosure for these types of accounts as they said it would be redundant of the short form disclosure and the prepaid account agreement; they also suggested that the long form disclosure could be provided post-acquisition or at the time of registration or activation in the payroll (and government benefit) context.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Rather than eliminating the short form disclosure altogether for payroll card accounts (and government benefit accounts), some industry commenters recommended that the Bureau eliminate certain short form requirements, such as the registration statement which would be inapplicable for these products.<footnote ref="370">See the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv) below for a discussion of elements that commenters suggested the Bureau remove from the short form disclosure in the payroll (and government benefit) context.</footnote>
             On the other hand, other industry commenters recommended permitting additional disclosures on the short form, such as disclosure of State-required methods to access wages without incurring fees. Some recommended requiring disclosure of all fees on the payroll card account (and government benefit account) short form disclosure as these accounts generally have fewer fees, thereby allowing room for full fee disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Similarly, some industry commenters argued that differences in other types of prepaid accounts necessitated greater flexibility in the content and delivery requirements for the short form disclosure. For example, some industry commenters, including issuing banks, program managers, and a trade association, recommended that the Bureau exclude non-reloadable prepaid products from the proposed disclosure regime, or at least from certain disclosure requirements such as those regarding registration and eligibility for FDIC insurance. Some industry commenters suggested that requiring standardized disclosures for these products would be of limited use to consumers given how the products are meant to be used, and would come at a prohibitively high cost for issuers; several suggested the burden of complying with the proposed disclosure requirements—for example, the requirement to calculate incidence-based fees—may lead to the removal of certain of these products from market. These commenters suggested instead that the Bureau create a separate disclosure regime for non-reloadable cards, similar to the treatment of loyalty, award, and promotional gift card products under the Gift Card Rule.<footnote ref="371">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; § 1005.20(a)(4)(iii) (exempting loyalty, award, or promotional gift cards from general coverage of the Gift Card Rule provided that they satisfy certain specific disclosure requirements).</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Likewise, several trade associations and a provider of digital wallets urged the Bureau not to sweep innovative financial services, such as digital wallets, into a disclosure regime they felt was designed for a specific type of product (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> GPR cards sold at retail) based on how it functioned at a fixed point in time. Specifically, the digital wallet provider argued that disclosures cannot be standardized effectively across industries as diverse as digital wallets and GPR cards. In addition, the commenter stated that current digital wallet models do not charge any fees for general usage. As such, the proposed short form disclosure's top-line fees would all be disclosed as $0 or N/A, which it said could potentially confuse consumers and cause them to abandon the digital wallet sign-up process. The commenter also noted that, because consumers are not likely to comparison shop between digital wallets and GPR cards, it believed the comparison shopping benefit of the short form disclosure would be inapplicable to digital wallets.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A payment network and a law firm writing on behalf of a coalition of prepaid issuers criticized the proposal for not providing a method for updating or curing outdated pricing, which it said issuers may typically accomplish through disclosures and consumer consent at registration, or at a later point in the customer relationship through a Regulation E change-in-terms notice. The payment network suggested that the Bureau grant a safe harbor and allow financial institutions to keep existing physical cards stocked at retail locations and notify consumers of any changes either by sending change-in-terms notices or by obtaining consumer consent upon registration. This commenter added that this approach would both cure outdated pricing on card packaging and also allow financial institutions to introduce new features that have a fee.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>While consumer groups generally supported the proposed disclosures, they also asserted some criticisms focused primarily on requesting that the Bureau prohibit certain fees, add certain information to either or both the short form and long form disclosures, and eliminate the proposed short form disclosure for multiple service plans. A few consumer groups also recommended enhancing the disclosures with visual aids, such as an image of a piggy bank to denote that an account offers a savings feature.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's General Approach to the Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is adopting a disclosure regime in final § 1005.18(b), under which financial institutions must generally provide both a short form and a long form disclosure before consumers acquire prepaid accounts. The final rule generally retains the content, formatting, and delivery requirements of the short form and long form disclosures as proposed, but includes substantial refinements to some individual elements and numerous smaller changes in response to information received through comments received on the proposal, the interagency consultation process, further consumer testing, and other research and analysis. The Bureau believes the final rule's disclosure requirements will achieve the desired results of providing consumers with a succinct and engaging overview of crucial information in the short form disclosure and an unabridged reference for all fees and other crucial information in the long form disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has also made substantial organizational changes to the structure of the final rule to facilitate understanding and compliance. The Bureau also has incorporated certain burden-reducing measures to address various concerns raised by commenters about the burden on industry they asserted would result from the proposed pre-acquisition disclosure regime. The analysis of costs and benefits in part VII.E.1 as well as the section-by-section analyses below both contain discussion of provisions adopted in this final rule that are aimed at reducing burden on industry relative to the proposal. These burden-alleviating modifications include the various changes to the additional fee types disclosures, including disclosure of two fees rather than three; a de minimis threshold; and reassessment and updating required every 24 months rather than 12. Other measures in the final rule that reduce burden include permitting reference in the short form disclosure for payroll card accounts (and government benefit accounts) to State-required information and other fee discounts and waivers pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B); permitting disclosure of the long form within other disclosures required by Regulation E pursuant to final § 1005.18(b)(7)(iii); and flexible updating of third-party fees pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(4)(vii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Although some industry commenters suggested that the competitive nature of the prepaid market forecloses the need for disclosure regulation, the Bureau believes both consumers and industry are better served by disclosure regulations carefully calibrated to balance the needs and concerns of all parties.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is issuing the final rule pursuant to EFTA section 904(a), (b), and (c), and 905(a) and 913(2), and section 1032 of the Dodd-Frank Act. As discussed further below in the section-by-section analyses of § 1005.18(b)(1)(i), (b)(2)(xiv), (b)(4)(ii), and (b)(9), the Bureau believes that adjustment of the timing and fee requirements and the disclosure language is necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of EFTA to provide a framework to establish the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of prepaid account consumers because the revision will assist consumers' understanding of the terms and conditions of their prepaid accounts. In addition, the Bureau believes that pre-acquisition disclosures of all fees for prepaid accounts as well as certain foreign language disclosures will, consistent with section 1032(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, ensure that the features of the prepaid accounts are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Short form and long form disclosures generally.</em> As discussed in the proposal, the Bureau believes the short form and long form disclosures both play crucial but distinct roles. Eliminating one or both would defeat the overall purpose of the pre-acquisition disclosure regime to provide consumers with comprehensible information to make reasoned purchase and use decisions with regard to their prepaid accounts. The short form discloses key fees and information to consumers in a standardized visual hierarchy that lends itself to comparison shopping prior to purchase and provides a handy summary post-purchase; the long form provides a comprehensive location for all fees and other information that a consumer may consult both prior to and after purchase. In the absence of such a disclosure regime, consumers have scant opportunity to see all fees prior to purchase or to quickly assess the relative benefits of one prepaid account over another.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Specifically, the Bureau believes that by prominently displaying key fees with limited explanatory text, the short form enhances consumers' ability to notice these key fees and enables them to use the disclosure to inform their acquisition choice. The Bureau also believes that the short form's design, and in particular the emphasized top-line portion of the disclosure, creates a visual hierarchy of information that will more effectively draw consumers' attention to a prepaid account's key terms. The Bureau also believes the general visual hierarchy as well as the relatively spare content of the short form increases the likelihood that consumers will engage with the disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau understands that, faced with the disclosures in the current marketplace, consumers may spend little time reviewing fee disclosures, particularly when shopping for prepaid accounts in person. The Bureau believes it is therefore important to provide a disclosure that quickly draws consumers' attention to the most important information regarding that particular account with minimal clutter on the form. For this reason, the Bureau designed and developed the short form as a concise snapshot of a prepaid account's key fees and features that is both easily noticeable and digestible by consumers. Relatedly, the Bureau also believes that the overall standardization of the short form disclosure will facilitate consumers' ability to comparison shop among prepaid account programs. The standardization of the static fee components of the short form disclosure ensures that consumers will be provided certain key fee information about prepaid accounts in a consistent manner regardless of how or where they shop for or obtain prepaid accounts. For example, under the final rule, a consumer who takes a package containing a prepaid account access device off of a J-hook in a retail location would see the same fee disclosures in the static portion of the short form as that consumer would see if shopping online for a prepaid account. Similarly, the standardization of the informational statements at the bottom of the short form permits that consumer to easily compare, for example, whether the prepaid accounts are eligible for FDIC or NCUA insurance.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that consumers offered payroll card accounts at their place of employment can also benefit from this standardization because, even though they cannot comparison shop among payroll card accounts, they can make meaningful comparisons with a prepaid account they may already have or with one they may choose to acquire in lieu of the payroll card account. Moreover, the straightforward standardized format of the short form can enhance consumers' comprehension of the key terms of the payroll card account if they do choose to acquire it. In sum, the Bureau believes that standardizing the short form disclosure across all possible acquisition channels will enhance consumer understanding of the terms of all prepaid accounts and make it easier for consumers to choose the prepaid account that best meets their needs.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau recognizes that providing only a subset of a prepaid account program's fee information on the short form might not provide all consumers with the information they need to make fully-informed acquisition decisions. For this reason, the new disclosure regime also requires the long form disclosure to be provided as a companion disclosure to the short form, offering a comprehensive repository of all of a prepaid account's fees and the conditions under which those fees could be imposed. The long form disclosure also provides detailed explanations to consumers about conditions that may cause fees to vary, such as the impact of crossing a threshold number of transactions or specific waivers and discounts. Such explanations are generally not permitted on the short form to preserve its simplicity, but may be relevant to some consumers' acquisition decisions.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau expects that consumers will use the long form if they want to review a comprehensive list of fees before choosing to acquire a prepaid account and learn details about the fees listed on the short form. In sum, the short form and the long form used alone or in tandem provide consumers with either or both an overview of the key information about the prepaid account and an unabridged list of fees and conditions and other important information.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that providing both disclosures is more beneficial than either form standing alone, and the Bureau does not believe that providing only the long form would be satisfactory. The Bureau understands that the potential size and complexity of the long form could lead consumers to disregard the disclosure in some settings, such as in retail locations where consumers are shopping while standing up, and not use it to comparison shop across products or even to evaluate a single product. However, in the Bureau's pre-proposal testing of a simulated purchase environment, some participants indicated they would use information found only in the long form disclosure, <em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> information absent from the short form disclosure, in making their purchase decisions.<footnote ref="372">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report I at 32-33.</footnote>
             Thus, insofar as the subset of fee information on the short form disclosure may be incomplete or insufficient for some consumers, the Bureau believes that providing both the short form and long form disclosures will strike the right balance between giving consumers key information about a prepaid account to aid understanding and comparison shopping, while also providing them with the opportunity to review all of a prepaid account's fee information pre-acquisition.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Disclosures for payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts.</em> The Bureau declines, as requested by some commenters, to eliminate the proposed short form disclosure requirement for payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts or, alternatively, create a short form disclosure specifically for these accounts, for several reasons. First, the short form disclosure provides an opportunity to clearly and conspicuously inform consumers of their wage and benefit payment rights under the compulsory use prohibition in EFTA section 913 and § 1005.10(e)(2), which the Bureau believes is key information for consumers. If the short form disclosure were eliminated and this statement was moved to the long form disclosure, for example, the Bureau believes it likely this information would be obscured by the relatively increased length and complexity of the long form disclosure and thereby deprive consumers of an opportunity to be informed of this crucial statutory right.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Second, the short form disclosure is important because consumers may be more likely to view it than the long form disclosure. The short form disclosure was designed to showcase information the Bureau believes is most important to consumers in their general prepaid account purchase and use decisions and such information is intended to complement the information disclosed in the more detailed long form. Pre-proposal testing indicated that consumers would prefer the short form over the long form when shopping for a prepaid card in certain environments, such as at retail while standing up.<footnote ref="373">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report I at 34.</footnote>
             The Bureau believes that consumers will benefit from receiving the short form disclosure for payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts in that consumers may receive multiple pieces of written information at the beginning of a new job or when applying for government benefits, that may compete for the consumer's attention. Thus, even if consumers do not look at the long form disclosure before choosing to receive wages or benefits via the account, they may at least see information about key fees and features of the account on the short form disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Third, while employees cannot comparison shop among payroll card accounts or government benefit accounts, the short form disclosure provides a convenient way to compare key fees and features with the consumer's own prepaid account (if they have one) and, perhaps at a later time, with other prepaid accounts. Consumers may also use the short form disclosure to quickly assess the relative advantage of receiving their wages (or benefits) via the account versus other payment methods, such as direct deposit to a bank account or by check. In sum, while the consumer may not comparison shop among payroll card accounts (or government benefit accounts), the short form disclosure nevertheless provides important comparison opportunities for consumers offered payroll card accounts (and government benefit accounts).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, while the Bureau understands that some payroll card accounts (and government benefit accounts) currently charge fewer fees and offer fewer features than GPR cards, requiring the short form disclosure in this context ensures that consumers know that certain features and services are free or unavailable and further, it ensures they will be apprised of the charges for any new fees the payroll (or government benefit) industry may impose on such accounts in the future.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Disclosures for non-reloadable cards and digital wallets.</em> The Bureau also considered the comments requesting exemption from the short form disclosure requirements for non-reloadable cards and digital wallets, but declines such exemption in the final rule. The Bureau believes consumers who buy these product types will benefit from the short form disclosure. As discussed above with respect to payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts, the short form disclosure was designed to showcase information participants identified in the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing as key to their general prepaid account purchase and use decision-making; such information is intended to complement the information disclosed in the more detailed long form. In addition, the Bureau is concerned that creating an individualized disclosure regime for different types of prepaid accounts could create a patchwork regulatory regime, which is one of the results this rule seeks to prevent.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to the request to exempt digital wallets from the pre-acquisition disclosure requirements (particularly the short form), the Bureau believes consumers of digital wallets should have the same opportunity to review fees (or lack thereof) in the short form disclosure as consumers of other prepaid accounts. While the majority of digital wallet models currently on the market may not charge usage fees, as one commenter asserted, this may not hold true in the future, especially if these products become more widely used and the features and services offered broaden. The Bureau is also not persuaded that there are sufficient factors distinguishing digital wallets from other types of prepaid accounts that are marketed or available for acquisition electronically. The Bureau is skeptical that the technical and other constraints suggested by commenters would impact the ability of digital wallets to provide pre-acquisition disclosures. The Bureau is not persuaded, therefore, that a convincing policy rationale exists for treating digital wallets differently than other prepaid accounts with regard to pre-acquisition disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Changes in terms and addition of new EFT services.</em> The Bureau understands financial institutions do not change the fee schedules for most prepaid accounts often, especially for prepaid products distributed in person, such as GPR cards and similar products sold at retail, because a financial institution may need to pull and replace outdated card packaging when making changes to those programs' disclosed fee structures. Financial institutions' reasons for pulling and replacing may include compliance with legal requirements under operative State consumer protection and contract laws, difficulties that may arise in attempting to provide notice of changed terms to consumers, as well as financial institutions' concerns about being accused of deceptive advertising practices by selling products with inaccurate disclosures. The Bureau encourages the practice of pulling and replacing when making significant changes to prepaid account programs, as it believes that doing so will facilitate consumer understanding of the products they are purchasing and reduce risk to the financial institution of litigation or regulatory claims of deception.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Two industry commenters, however, stated that financial institutions also sometimes make changes either through disclosures and consumer consent at registration, or at a later point in the customer relationship through a Regulation E change-in-terms notice. The Bureau recognizes that Regulation E provides a system for notifying existing customers of changes in terms to existing accounts, set forth in § 1005.8(a). The Bureau believes that in some circumstances, such procedures may also provide an appropriate means to notify new customers of changes to recently acquired prepaid accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also notes that Regulation E also provides a means, separate from a change-in-terms notice, for financial institutions to notify consumers of terms associated with a new EFT service that is added to a consumer's account, in § 1005.7(c).<footnote ref="374">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See also&lt;/em&gt; final § 1005.18(f)(1), which extends the requirements of § 1005.7 to all fees, not just fees for EFTs or the right to make EFTs.</footnote>
             The Bureau believes that such procedures are appropriate in circumstances where a financial institution is, for example, making available a new optional service for all prepaid accounts in a particular prepaid account program. In such a circumstance, financial institutions do not need to pull and replace card packaging that does not disclose that new optional feature, even though a long form disclosure that may be provided inside the card packaging pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii)(A), the number of additional fee types pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii), and the listing of additional fee types pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) may be incomplete or inaccurate due to the addition of that service. Instead, a financial institution may provide to new customers disclosures for the addition of the new service in accordance with § 1005.7(c) post-acquisition. The Bureau expects, however, that financial institutions will keep their other disclosures up to date (including those provided electronically and orally, as well as disclosures provided in writing that are not a part of pre-printed packaging materials, such as those printed by a financial institution upon a consumer's request).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Other requests by commenters.</em> In response to the consumer groups requesting the addition of visual aids to the disclosures, the Bureau believes that there is insufficient space in the short form to accommodate such visuals and that the length and detail of the information in the long form disclosure obviate the need for such additional requirements there.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With regard to comments from some consumer group commenters and the office of a State Attorney General recommending prohibition of certain fees, such requests are outside of the scope of this rulemaking. However, the Bureau intends to monitor compliance with this rule as well as developments in the prepaid market in general, and will consider additional action in future rulemakings if necessary.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Alternative Approaches Considered by the Bureau</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Before proposing the pre-acquisition disclosure regime that the Bureau is adopting in this final rule, the Bureau considered and rejected two alternative approaches. As discussed in the proposal, an “all-in” approach would have disclosed a single monthly cost for using a particular prepaid account.<footnote ref="375">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 79 FR 77102, 77150-51 (Dec. 23, 2014).</footnote>
             Proponents of this approach said it would provide a quick and understandable reference point and, as compared to a disclosure listing several different numbers with line items for each fee type, could also allow for easier comparisons among prepaid account programs. The Bureau also considered the “category heading” approach which would have featured a short form disclosure with category headings based on the function for which a consumer would use the service associated with each fee, a format that many prepaid account providers have already adopted, in lieu of the top-line fee type format the Bureau is adopting in this final rule.<footnote ref="376">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; ICF Report I at app. C, 2A. As listed in that prototype short form disclosure, an “Add and withdraw money” category, for example, would list the various ways the consumer could withdraw money from a prepaid account, such as through a withdrawal from an ATM.</footnote>
             The proposal included a discussion of the justification for the Bureau's rejection of these two alternative approaches in favor of the pre-acquisition disclosure regime that the Bureau proposed and is now adopting in this final rule.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received few comments regarding these rejected alternatives. Two program managers expressed their support for the Bureau's decision to reject both the “all-in” and “category heading” approaches for the reasons the Bureau set forth in the proposal and an issuing bank supported the Bureau's reasoning for avoiding the all-in approach. One of the program managers noted that use of payroll cards varies significantly both by individual consumer and the specific employer's payroll card account program. On the other hand, two consumer group commenters recommended that the Bureau reconsider the feasibility of the “all-in” approach. While acknowledging the Bureau's valid concerns about determining typical usage costs given the wide variety of consumer use, they said that providing through the short form disclosure the estimated cost of typical use of a specific prepaid account would help the minority of consumers who are “intensive users” of prepaid accounts and use them essentially as a substitute for checking accounts. They recommended that the Bureau require financial institutions to analyze the distribution of accountholders' actual total expenses and identify total expenses at the 25th and 75th percentiles of distribution. They said this analysis would show that consumers who use a specific prepaid account product frequently for routine financial transactions would be likely to incur costs within a concrete range.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons the Bureau declined to embrace the “all-in” and “category heading” approaches in the proposal, the Bureau also has rejected these approaches in the final rule in favor of the pre-acquisition disclosure regime described above and throughout this final rule. As discussed in more detail in the proposal <footnote ref="377">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 79 FR 77102, 77150 (Dec. 23, 2014).</footnote>
             and acknowledged by the consumer groups recommending the “all-in” approach, the Bureau continues to question the viability of developing a single formula that accurately reflects typical consumer use of a particular prepaid account program, including how to decide which fee types to include in such a formula and in view of studies indicating there are numerous use cases for prepaid accounts, particularly GPR cards.<footnote ref="378">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; 2014 Pew Study at 13.</footnote>
             Moreover, a prepaid account that might have a higher cost under such a formula adopted by the Bureau may actually be less costly for certain consumers, depending on how they use the prepaid account. For example, a formula that included ATM withdrawal fees would disclose an “all-in” fee not germane to consumers who do not withdraw cash via an ATM. The Bureau is concerned that such a result may be confusing to consumers. The Bureau also believes that an explanation of the methodology used to calculate the “all-in” disclosure would disturb the balance in the short form of the most important information for consumers and the brevity and clarity necessary for optimal consumer comprehension. Thus, the Bureau has concluded that an “all-in” disclosure would be of limited utility and could even mislead consumers, and declines to adopt such a disclosure in this final rule.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also continues to believe the use of the “category heading” approach would not be appropriate because the headings would take up valuable space in the short form disclosure that would limit disclosure of other, more important information, particularly for headings under which there would only be disclosed one fee. Also, as discussed above, the Bureau's pre-proposal consumer testing indicated that the top-line approach embraced in the proposed and final rules proved effective with consumers and the Bureau does not believe that the short form disclosure could effectively accommodate both approaches together. Finally, pre-proposal testing revealed that participant comprehension of fees and their purposes did not improve with the use of category headings. The Bureau also notes that the less space-restricted long form disclosure, pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(7)(i)(B), requires the use of subheadings by the categories of function for which a financial institution may impose fees, as illustrated by Sample Form A-10(e). The Bureau thus declines to adopt a “category heading” approach for the short form disclosure in this final rule.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>18(b) Pre-Acquisition Disclosure Requirements—Commentary</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting two comments to accompany § 1005.18(b), as described below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Written and electronic pre-acquisition disclosures.</em> The final rule includes certain specific requirements for pre-acquisition disclosures depending on whether they are provided in written, electronic, or oral form. <em data-original="E-03">See, e.g.,</em> § 1005.18(b)(1)(iii) and (6). The Bureau is adding new comment 18(b)-1 to provide additional guidance as to the interaction of these § 1005.18(b) disclosure requirements with the E-Sign Act and with other existing provisions within Regulation E. Specifically, comment 18(b)-1 explains that existing § 1005.4(a)(1) generally requires that disclosures be made in writing; written disclosures may be provided in electronic form in accordance with the E-Sign Act. The comment goes on to say that, because final § 1005.18(b)(6)(i)(B) provides that electronic disclosures required by final § 1005.18(b) need not meet the consumer consent or other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act, § 1005.18(b) addresses certain requirements for written and electronic pre-acquisition disclosures separately. Final § 1005.18(b) also addresses specific requirements for pre-acquisition disclosures provided orally.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph><em data-original="E-03">Disclosures in foreign currencies.</em> A payment network commenter recommended that the Bureau permit disclosure of fees in a foreign currency for prepaid cards denominated in that currency. The commenter gave the example of permitting disclosures in pound sterling for prepaid accounts sold in U.S. airports for intended use in England. The Bureau is adding comment 18(b)-2 to clarify that such disclosures are permitted. Specifically, comment 18(b)-2 explains that fee amounts required to be disclosed by § 1005.18(b) may be disclosed in a foreign currency for a prepaid account denominated in that foreign currency, other than the fee for the purchase price required by § 1005.18(b)(5). The comment gives an example that a prepaid account sold in a U.S. airport intended for use in England may disclose in pound sterling (£) the fees required to be disclosed in the short form and long form disclosures and outside the short form disclosure, except for the purchase price.

      <title>Section 1005.36 Transfers Scheduled in Advance</title>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed above in connection with the § 1005.30(e) definition of “remittance transfer,” the Board requested comment on whether the rule should exclude from coverage online bill payments, including preauthorized transfers. As noted above, most industry commenters argued that these transfers should be excluded from the final rule. These commenters argued that the provider would not be in a position to know, at the time disclosures are required, the applicable exchange rate for transfers that are scheduled to be sent at a later date.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For the reasons discussed above in the supplementary information to § 1005.30(e), the final rule does not exclude online bill payments from the definition of “remittance transfer,” nor does it exclude certain other remittance transfers that a sender schedules in advance, including preauthorized remittance transfers. Thus, the final rule generally requires that disclosures be provided in accordance with the timing and accuracy rules set forth in § 1005.31, both with respect to the required pre-payment disclosure and the required receipt. Estimates may be disclosed, to the extent permitted by § 1005.32.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>However, the Bureau believes that preauthorized remittance transfers, whether for bill payments or for other reasons, raise issues relating to the practical aspects of compliance, and potential consumer confusion issues. As discussed above, § 1005.31(e) links the timing requirements for providing pre-payment disclosures and receipts to senders to the time when the transfer is requested and payment is made by the sender. Similarly, the disclosure accuracy rule in § 1005.31(f) relates to when the sender's payment is made. For purposes of subpart B, payment is made when payment is authorized. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comments 31(e)-2 and 34(a)-5. Accordingly, if all preauthorized remittance transfers were subject to § 1005.31, providers would have to provide both pre-payment disclosures and receipts at the time the preauthorized remittance transfers are requested and authorized by the sender. Moreover, these disclosures would need to be accurate for the first and all subsequent transfers scheduled in the future (except to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that in some circumstances, it is impracticable for providers to provide accurate disclosures for subsequent transfers at the time preauthorized remittance transfers are authorized. For example, while a provider may be able to know or to hedge for a specified exchange rate with respect to the first transfer, the provider or the institution involved in the remittance transfer that sets the exchange rate may be reluctant to set a specified exchange rate applicable to all subsequent transfers that are scheduled to be made into the future. This reluctance could arise due to the risk associated with participating in foreign exchange markets, and the manners in which providers and their partners manage such risk. Many wholesale exchange rates are set largely through currency markets in which rates can fluctuate frequently.<footnote ref="87">Some foreign exchange rates are set by monetary authorities. There are a variety of business models that providers use to fund transfers that are received in foreign currency. The timing of when foreign currency is purchased, the role of the provider in such a purchase, and the role of other intermediaries, partners, agents, and other parties can vary.</footnote>
             As a result, whenever there are time lags in between the time when the retail rate applied to a transfer is set, the time when the relevant foreign currency is purchased, and the time when funds are delivered, a provider (and/or its business partner) may face losses due to unexpected changes in the value of the relevant foreign currency.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Providers and/or their partners generally use a variety of pricing, business processes, or hedging techniques to manage or minimize this exchange rate risk. For some, and perhaps many providers (or their partners), the task of managing or minimizing exchange risk may become more complicated or more costly if the amount of time between when the rate is set for a customer and when the transfer is sent increases. Setting the retail rate that applies to a transfer far in advance of when that transfer is sent may require the provider or other parties involved in processing the remittance transfer to use additional or more sophisticated risk management tools.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Some preauthorized remittance transfers may be set up to vary in amount (for example, based on the amount of a utilities bill). In such cases, while the remittance transfer provider may know the amount to be transferred in the first payment, the provider may not know, at the time the sender authorizes the preauthorized remittance transfer, the amounts that will be transferred in subsequent months. Moreover, even if the scheduled amounts to be transferred were fixed, and a provider were permitted to disclose an estimated exchange rate for future payments, providing estimated exchange rates at the time of the initial request for transfers beyond the first transfer may not be useful to senders—and could even be misleading—because currency fluctuations over several months could cause the actual rate applied to particular transfers to vary substantially. The Bureau recognizes that the market for preauthorized remittance transfers is still developing. Consequently, the Bureau is concerned that if providers were required to provide accurate disclosures for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers at the time those transfers are authorized, in many cases providers would not be able to offer preauthorized remittance transfer products, which could limit consumer access to a potentially valuable product.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also believes that the right to cancel a remittance transfer no later than 30 minutes after the sender makes payment as provided in § 1005.34(a) is not appropriate when applied to certain remittance transfers that a sender schedules in advance, including preauthorized remittance transfers. When a sender schedules a remittance transfer many days—or even months—in advance of when the transfer is to be made, a sender should have the flexibility to cancel the transfer more than 30 minutes after requesting the transfer, given the delay between when the sender authorizes the remittance transfer and when the sender schedules the remittance transfer to be made. In such circumstances, the Bureau believes that remittance transfer providers can accommodate a longer cancellation period without the risk that a sender's cancellation would delay the remittance transfer. Thus, the Bureau believes that a cancellation period tied to when the transfer is made, rather than when the transfer is authorized, is more beneficial to senders.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Therefore, to effectuate the purposes of the EFTA and to facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to adopt a new § 1005.36, which sets forth disclosure requirements specifically applicable to preauthorized remittance transfers, as well as specific cancellation requirements for any remittance transfer scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer. Section 1005.36(a) and (b) address specific requirements for the timing and accuracy of disclosures for preauthorized remittance transfers. Section 1005.36(c) addresses the cancellation requirements applicable to any remittance transfer scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, including preauthorized remittance transfers. Because § 1005.36 only addresses timing, accuracy, and cancellation requirements, the other requirements of subpart B, such as content and formatting requirements and the foreign language requirements, continue to apply to remittance transfers subject to § 1005.36. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> comment 36-1.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau's January 2012 Proposed Rule, published elsewhere in the Federal Register today, solicits comment on alternative disclosure and cancellation requirements with respect to remittance transfers subject to § 1005.36.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1005.36 Transfers Scheduled Before the Date of Transfer</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Overview</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The February Final Rule sets forth several procedures for the timing, content, and accuracy of pre-payment disclosures and receipts for preauthorized remittance transfers. At the same time, the February Proposal sought comment on whether further adjustments were necessary to address one-time transfers scheduled before the date of transfer and preauthorized remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Specifically, the February Final Rule treats the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers the same as most other remittance transfers by requiring that accurate (not estimated) figures be disclosed in the pre-payment disclosure and receipt. But in recognition of the potential risks associated with setting exchange rates and the potential difficulty of determining the amount to be provided to a designated recipient weeks or months before subsequent transfers, the February Final Rule does not require that disclosures for an entire series of preauthorized remittance transfers be provided when the sender initially requests the transfer and authorizes payment. Instead, the February Final Rule requires remittance transfer providers to issue pre-payment disclosures and receipts for each subsequent transfer closer to the dates of the individual transfers. In particular, under the February Final Rule, the pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent transfer must be provided within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of the transfer, and the receipt for each subsequent transfer generally must be provided no later than one business day after the date on which the transfer is made. The pre-payment disclosure and receipt for each subsequent transfer must be accurate when the respective transfer is made, unless a statutory exception applies. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.36(b). Senders must also be permitted to cancel these transfers up to three business days before the date of transfer. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.36(c).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Because the Bureau was concerned that even with the modifications permitted by the February Final Rule, the disclosure requirements could pose difficulty for certain remittance transfers scheduled significantly before the date of transfer, the February Proposal asked a number of questions regarding whether to make further adjustments to the disclosure and cancellation regime for these transfers. The Bureau sought input on how to manage the importance to senders of accurate and timely disclosures, permit growth of this portion of the remittance transfer market, and limit industry compliance burdens in light of the potential risks associated with providing accurate exchange rates and the difficulty of determining the amount to be received by designated recipients for a particular transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Specifically, the February Proposal sought comments on a number of potential changes to the February Final Rule concerning the type, timing, and accuracy of pre-payment disclosures and receipts a sender should receive in connection with one-time transfers and the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers scheduled to occur more than ten days before the date of transfer. The February Proposal also sought comment on whether senders should receive disclosures for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers and, if so, what form those disclosures should take. Finally, the February Proposal sought comment on what cancellation rules should apply to these transactions and how and when those rules should be disclosed to senders.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Based on comments received, the Bureau is amending the February Final Rule to allow providers increased flexibility, while maintaining requirements that senders receive sufficient and timely information to help inform their selection of remittance transfer providers and help them understand the terms of their remittance transfers. With respect to timing, the final rule requires pre-payment disclosures and receipts for one-time transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer and the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers to be provided in the same manner as they are provided for all other transfers (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> at request and at payment authorization). The final rule also requires providers to give senders additional, accurate receipts after the transfer is sent if prior disclosures contained estimates pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2). The Bureau is also maintaining the three-business-day cancellation period in § 1005.36(c). Finally, although the Bureau is generally eliminating the requirement to provide pre-payment disclosures for subsequent remittance transfers in a preauthorized series, the Bureau is adopting a new § 1005.36(d) to require disclosure of upcoming dates of transfer and cancellation provisions a reasonable time before the dates of such transfers.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>36(a) Timing</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.36(a) of the February Final Rule addresses the timing of disclosures for the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers. In the February Proposal, the Bureau sought comment on a number of questions relating to the timing of disclosures for all remittance transfers that are scheduled more than ten days before the date of transfer, including preauthorized remittance transfers, as described below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As is discussed further below, to further the purposes of the EFTA and facilitate compliance, the Bureau finds it necessary and proper to use its EFTA section 904(a) and (c) authority to adopt § 1005.36(a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii), and (a)(2)(i) through (iii) and to eliminate the requirement to provide pre-payment disclosures for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. Sections 1005.36(a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii), (a)(2)(i), and (a)(2)(ii) are revised from the February Final Rule. Section 1005.36(a)(2)(iii) is a new provision in the final rule.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>36(a)(1) Timing of Disclosures for One-Time Transfers Scheduled Before the Date of Transfer and the First in a Series of Preauthorized Remittance Transfers</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.36(a) of the February Final Rule addresses the timing of required disclosures for preauthorized remittance transfers. Section 1005.36(a)(1) of the February Final Rule requires that, for the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the pre-payment disclosure and receipt be provided in the same manner as required for all other transfers. In the February Proposal, the Bureau sought comment on whether to make further adjustments in the disclosure rules for preauthorized remittance transfers and certain other transfers scheduled before the date of transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to the timing of pre-payment disclosures and receipts given to senders upon request of and payment for a transfer, the Bureau received few comments, apart from those raising the concerns discussed earlier regarding the disclosure of exact exchange rates far before the date of a remittance transfer. Largely, industry commenters did not raise other concerns about the requirement that remittance transfer providers give pre-payment disclosures (or combined disclosures) when transfers are requested and prior to payment and receipts (if no combined disclosures were provided) when payment is authorized for either one-time transfers scheduled before the date of transfer or the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers. In the final rule, the Bureau maintains the requirement from the February Final Rule that for any one-time remittance transfer scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer, and for the first transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, a remittance transfer provider must provide a pre-payment disclosure and a receipt to the sender subject to the same timing rules that apply to any one-time transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For clarity and consistency, the Bureau is revising § 1005.36(a)(1) from the February Final Rule as a new § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) by adjusting the provision to apply both to a one-time advance transfer scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer and the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, rather than just the latter. The Bureau is also clarifying that remittance transfer providers may use combined disclosures, pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(3), for transfers covered by this provision.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also requested comment on what follow-up disclosures, if any, should be provided to senders after authorization of a remittance transfer scheduled before the date of transfer. Specifically the Bureau asked whether a second receipt with accurate information should be provided to a sender within a reasonable time period prior to such a transfer, if the remittance transfer provider previously disclosed estimates pursuant to proposed § 1005.32(b)(2).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Most industry commenters argued against requiring a second receipt with accurate figures to be given prior to a remittance transfer when the original pre-payment disclosure and receipt contained estimates. These commenters argued that to the extent such a provision required disclosure of accurate figures ten days before the date of transfer, it would render the exception allowing providers to disclose estimates meaningless.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>To the extent the Bureau would instead allow a second receipt to contain estimates, industry commenters argued that giving senders three documents (a pre-payment disclosure when requesting the remittance transfer, a receipt when payment is authorized for the transfer, and a second receipt a reasonable time before the transfer) would be confusing and unhelpful to senders. One industry commenter suggested there would be limited value added by a second receipt that could contain information that, other than updated estimated exchange rates and associated figures, would be identical to the information included in the initial receipt. Another commenter expressed concern that a sender could be confused into thinking that a remittance transfer provider has made a single transfer multiple times or that an error had occurred, necessitating the additional disclosure. Industry commenters also stated that they thought senders would benefit little from additional disclosures before a transfer, particularly when any such benefit is balanced against the increased upfront and ongoing costs to the remittance transfer providers of giving senders the additional receipt. These commenters argued that providers would pass these costs on to senders. Finally, as an alternative to a second pre-transfer receipt, one industry commenter suggested that providers give senders receipts reflecting actual figures (and not estimates) after the providers send the transfers to the designated recipient. Consumer group commenters argued that receipts with actual figures (and not estimates) be provided to senders a reasonable time prior to the date of each transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In light of the Bureau's decision to allow the use of estimates in certain disclosures for remittance transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of a remittance transfer rather than ten days as originally proposed, the Bureau believes that a follow-up receipt provided closer to the date of the transfer is not likely to provide significant benefit to senders in many cases. For example, if a remittance transfer provider schedules a remittance transfer one month before the date of transfer, and discloses an estimated exchange rate at that time, and then provides a sender a receipt with an accurate exchange rate only four business days before the date of transfer (because unless a statutory exception applies, § 1005.32(b)(2) of the final rule permits estimates only for disclosures five or more business days before the date of transfer) the receipt might not reach the sender before the expiration of the three-business-day cancellation period in § 1005.36(c). Conversely, if this follow-up receipt were sent five or more business days before the date of transfer, estimates of certain amounts would be permitted under § 1005.32(b)(2). The Bureau believes that such a disclosure generally would be of little additional value as compared to the initial estimate provided in the pre-payment disclosure and receipt required by § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) if the wholesale rate, and thus the retail rate, had not moved significantly since the initial estimate was provided.

        <analysisParagraph>Although the Bureau is not requiring a second receipt closer to the time of transfer, the Bureau believes that for every remittance transfer, where a sender receives a disclosure that contains estimates pursuant to § 1005.32, the sender should also receive an accurate post-transfer disclosure that informs the sender of the actual exchange rate (as well as fees, taxes, and other figures) applied to the transfer. Thus, to further consumer protections, the Bureau is adopting a revised § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii), which requires that if the disclosures provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) contain estimates as permitted by § 1005.32(b)(2) (for transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer), the provider must mail or deliver to the sender an additional receipt meeting the requirements described in § 1005.31(b)(2) no later than one business day after the date of transfer.<footnote ref="17">The timing requirement in § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) does not prevent a remittance transfer provider from providing this receipt before the date of the transfer. The same is true for disclosures required by § 1005.36(a)(2)(ii), which are discussed below.</footnote>
             If the transfer involves the transfer of funds from the sender's account held by the provider, the receipt required by § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) may be provided on or with the next periodic statement for that account, or within 30 days after the date of the transfer if a periodic statement is not provided. As required by § 1005.36(b)(3), which is discussed below, this receipt must contain accurate figures unless estimates are allowed by § 1005.32(a) or (b)(1).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As many remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer are conducted by senders who have accounts with remittance transfer providers, the Bureau believes the final rule may relieve many providers of having to provide receipts immediately after each preauthorized remittance transfer or after one-time transfer scheduled five or more business days before the date of the transfer. In addition, the Bureau believes that an accurate receipt will ensure that senders receive accurate accountings of their transfers. Furthermore, to the extent that senders of preauthorized remittance transfers want to comparison shop based on price for future transfers, these receipts may be a mechanism that allows senders to better understand providers' pricing mechanisms (by allowing a sender to know the exchange rate applied to each transfer) and the amount received by the designated recipient.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>36(a)(2) Timing of Disclosures for Subsequent Preauthorized Remittance Transfers</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The February Final Rule contains disclosure provisions specific to subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> all preauthorized remittance transfers after the first in the series of transfers). Section 1005.36(a)(2)(i) of the February Final Rule requires that a remittance transfer provider also mail or deliver a pre-payment disclosure to the sender for each subsequent transfer and requires the disclosure to be mailed or delivered within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of each subsequent transfer. This provision is in lieu of the general timing rule, which would have required that a pre-payment disclosure for each transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers be given at the time of the initial request (and thus a sender would receive a disclosure for every preauthorized transfer when requesting the entire series). <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(e)(1). Section 1005.36(a)(2)(ii) in the February Final Rule requires a receipt to be mailed or delivered no later than one business day after the transfer or, for account-based transactions, on or with the next regularly scheduled periodic statement or within 30 days after payment is made for the remittance transfer if a periodic statement is not provided.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In the February Proposal, the Bureau sought comment on an alternative to the requirement in the February Final Rule that a pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfer be provided within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of transfer: Whether the pre-payment disclosure requirement for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers should be eliminated.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters generally favored eliminating the requirement for providing pre-payment disclosures for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers for many of the same reasons these commenters disfavored a rule requiring accurate pre-payment disclosures for other transfers scheduled before the date of transfer. These commenters argued that a pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent transfer would be unnecessary, potentially confusing to senders, and burdensome to providers. For example, one commenter argued that senders schedule preauthorized remittance transfers for purposes of convenience and that senders typically do not comparison shop to complete each recurring transfer. The same commenter expressed concern that the requirement of an additional pre-payment disclosure might cause some providers to no longer allow consumers to schedule transfers before the date of transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In contrast, one consumer group commenter supported requiring pre-payment disclosures to be provided to senders ten days before each subsequent transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers (and stated that if estimates were permitted for disclosures related to such transfers, that those disclosures contain current estimates). This commenter urged that the Bureau maintain the requirement in the February Final Rule for pre-payment disclosures so that senders have additional information regarding the details of each preauthorized remittance transfer prior to such transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Upon consideration of these comments and to facilitate compliance, the Bureau is eliminating the requirement to provide a pre-payment disclosure within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer. Thus, the Bureau is eliminating what was § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) in the February Final Rule. The Bureau is doing so for several reasons. The Bureau is concerned that the requirement in the February Final Rule—a pre-payment disclosure sent a reasonable time prior to each subsequent remittance transfer—might provide senders only a limited amount of information because pre-payment disclosures for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers sent five or more business days before the date of transfer could contain estimates, pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2). In addition, in some scenarios, this could create a potential for confusing and overlapping disclosures and receipts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Conversely, the Bureau believes that if it mandated that pre-payment disclosures be sent less than five business days before a subsequent transfer such that the disclosures could not contain estimates under § 1005.32(b)(2), the disclosure would be of little use to the sender for the upcoming transfer as it could be received too close to (or after) the cancellation deadline. Separately, confusion for senders could exist in some circumstances where preauthorized remittance transfers are scheduled relatively close together or receipts are provided with periodic statements. In these cases, a sender might receive a post-transfer receipt from a prior preauthorized remittance transfer close in time to a pre-payment disclosure for the next transfer. These documents, with potentially differing exchange rates and other figures, might confuse senders unnecessarily.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also believes that eliminating the requirement for pre-payment disclosures for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers is appropriate in part because senders will receive some relevant information in receipts for prior preauthorized remittance transfers. The final rule requires that for any preauthorized remittance transfer, the remittance transfer provider must provide a sender a receipt with accurate information (except to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32(a) or (b)(1)). A receipt from the prior transfer with accurate amounts may provide the sender with information that could educate the sender not only about the prior transfer but also about the provider's practices generally, which may help the sender judge whether to continue with the provider for future preauthorized remittance transfers. The Bureau believes a sender can learn about a remittance transfer provider's exchange rate practices from what the designated recipient actually received from the prior transfers in the series. In addition, the receipt provided for the initial transfer in a series provides information about the fees and taxes that will apply to all subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers, unless a change necessitates a new disclosure, as discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Although the Bureau is eliminating the requirement that a remittance transfer provider provide a pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the Bureau remains concerned that previously disclosed figures (other than the estimates themselves) could change, rendering the figures disclosed in the pre-payment disclosure provided for the initial transfer inaccurate as applied to the subsequent transfers.<footnote ref="18">Although changes in terms trigger notice requirements in some instances under Regulation E (&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; 12 CFR 1005.10), that provision does not apply to remittance transfers that are not electronic fund transfers.</footnote>
             Comment 31(f)-1 to the February Final Rule explains that under the general timing and accuracy rules in subpart B of Regulation E, providers must give senders new pre-payment disclosures before accepting payment if previously provided pre-payment disclosures are inaccurate. However, since a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or, as discussed below, .36(a)(2)(i), may serve as a disclosure with respect to multiple subsequent preauthorized transfers, the temporal elements disclosed on those receipts would only be accurate with respect to the transfer to occur after the receipt is provided.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Thus, the Bureau is adopting a new § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) to specifically address certain changes in terms related to subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. Section 1005.36(a)(2)(i) states that if any of the information on the most recent receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or § 1005.36(a)(2)(i), other than the temporal disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) (Date Available) and (b)(2)(vii) (Transfer Date), is no longer accurate with respect to a subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer for reasons other than as permitted by § 1005.32, then the remittance transfer provider must provide an updated receipt meeting the requirements described in § 1005.31(b)(2) to the sender. The provider must mail or deliver this receipt to the sender within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of the next subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer. Such receipt must clearly and conspicuously indicate that it contains updated disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 36(a)(2)-1 clarifies when the disclosure required by § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) must be provided. Specifically, it states that when a sender schedules a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the provider is generally not required to provide a pre-payment disclosure prior to the date of each subsequent transfer. However, § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) requires the provider to provide a pre-payment disclosure and receipt for the first in the series of preauthorized remittance transfers in accordance with the timing requirements set forth in § 1005.31(e). <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.36(a)(1)(i). While certain information in those disclosures is expressly permitted to be estimated (<em data-original="E-03">see</em> § 1005.32(b)(2)(i) through (iii)), other information is not permitted to be estimated, or is limited in how it may be estimated. When any of the information on the most recent receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i), other than the temporal disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) (the Date Available) and (b)(2)(vii) (the Transfer Date), is no longer accurate with respect to a subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer for reasons other than as permitted by § 1005.32, the provider must provide, within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of the next preauthorized remittance transfer, a receipt that complies with § 1005.31(b)(2) and which discloses, among the other disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(2), the changed terms.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For example, if the provider discloses in the pre-payment disclosure for the first in the series of preauthorized remittance transfers that its fee for each remittance transfer is $20 and, after six preauthorized remittance transfers, the provider increases its fee to $30 (to the extent permitted by contract law), the provider must provide the sender a receipt that complies with §§ 1005.31(b)(2) and 1005.36(b)(2) within a reasonable time prior to the seventh transfer. Barring a further change, this receipt will apply to transfers after the seventh transfer. Or, if, after the sixth transfer, a tax increases from 1.5% of the amount that will be transferred to the designated recipient to 2.0% of the amount that will be transferred to the designated recipient, the provider must provide the sender a receipt that complies with §§ 1005.31(b)(2) and 1005.36(b)(2) within a reasonable time prior to the seventh transfer. In contrast, § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) does not require an updated receipt where an exchange rate, estimated as permitted in § 1005.32, changes.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 36(a)(2)-2 explains that in order to clearly and conspicuously indicate that the provider's fee has changed as required by § 1005.36(a)(2)(i), the provider could, for example, state on the receipt: “Transfer Fees (UPDATED) * * * $30.” To the extent that other figures on the receipt must be revised because of the new fee, the receipt should similarly indicate that those figures are updated.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In the February Proposal, the Bureau also solicited comment on whether it should provide a safe harbor interpreting the “within a reasonable time” standard for providing a pre-payment disclosure for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. Although such a disclosure is no longer required, the same “within a reasonable time” requirement now applies to receipts required by § 1005.36(a)(2)(i). The bulk of the comments received on how to interpret “within a reasonable time” concerned industry commenters' concerns regarding the requirement in the February Final Rule that any required pre-payment disclosures reflect the actual exchange rates that will apply to preauthorized remittance transfers. Industry commenters stated that it would be difficult to disclose accurate exchange rates ten days before the date of a remittance transfer. Insofar as § 1005.32(b)(2) allows estimates in disclosures provided for remittance transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer, this concern should be alleviated. Industry commenters generally stated that if estimates were permitted, ten days was a reasonable period of time.
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 36(a)(2)-3 explains if a receipt required by § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) (or, as discussed below, required by § 1005.36(d)(1)) is mailed, the receipt would be considered to be received by the sender five business days after it is posted in the mail. If hand delivered or provided electronically, the receipt would be considered to be received by the sender at the time of delivery. Thus, if the provider mails the receipt not later than ten business days before the scheduled date of the transfer, or hand or electronically delivers the receipt not later than five business days before the scheduled date of the transfer, the provider would be deemed to have mailed or delivered the receipt within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of the subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau is modifying § 1005.36(a)(2)(ii) from the February Final Rule, which requires receipts for all subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. As adopted, § 1005.36(a)(2)(ii) explains when receipts must be sent. It states that unless a receipt was provided in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) that contained no estimates pursuant to § 1005.32, the remittance transfer provider must mail or deliver to the sender a receipt described in § 1005.31(b)(2) no later than one business day after the date of the transfer. If the remittance transfer involves the transfer of funds from the sender's account held by the provider, the receipt required by this paragraph may be provided on or with the next periodic statement for that account, or within 30 days after the date of the transfer if a periodic statement is not provided.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau is adopting an additional disclosure requirement for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers as § 1005.36(a)(2)(iii), which requires providers to provide the disclosures required by § 1005.36(d) in accordance with the timing requirements of that section. Section 1005.36(d) is discussed in more detail below.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>36(b) Accuracy</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The February Final Rule contains, in § 1005.36(b), requirements for the accuracy of disclosures for preauthorized remittance transfers. Under that provision in the February Final Rule, the pre-payment disclosures and receipt for the first scheduled transfers in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers are required to be accurate at the time of payment (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> they must comply with § 1005.31(f), which states that disclosures must be accurate when a sender makes payment for the remittance transfer, except to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32). For subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers, as discussed above, the February Final Rule requires providers to give accurate pre-payment disclosures as of when the transfer is made within a reasonable time prior to each transfer and then to provide an accurate receipt after each transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>To further compliance and to enhance consumer protections, the Bureau finds it necessary and proper to use its EFTA section 904(a) and (c) authority to adopt a revised § 1005.36(b). The Bureau is revising § 1005.36(b) to address the accuracy of receipts provided for remittance transfers that are scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer, as well as preauthorized remittance transfers. The Bureau is adopting § 1005.36(b)(1), which states that for a one-time transfer scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer or the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, disclosures provided in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) must comply with § 1005.31(f) by being accurate when the sender makes payment, except to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers, the Bureau is adopting § 1005.36(b)(2), which states that for each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer, the most recent receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i) must be accurate as of when such transfer is made, except: (i) The temporal elements required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) (Date Available) and (b)(2)(vii) (Transfer Date) must be accurate only if the transfer is the first transfer to occur after the disclosure was provided, and (ii) to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32. As noted above, since a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i) may serve as a disclosure with respect to multiple subsequent preauthorized transfers, the temporal elements disclosed on those receipts need only be accurate with respect to the transfer to occur after the receipt is provided.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>To address situations in which receipts may be provided after the date of a remittance transfer, the Bureau is adopting a new § 1005.36(b)(3). That provision states that such receipts (provided pursuant to either § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) or (a)(2)(ii)) must be accurate as of when the remittance transfer to which it pertains is made, except to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32(a) or (b)(1).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 36(b)-1 addressed estimates and, in particular, stated that providers may use any of the exceptions set forth in § 1005.32, to the extent applicable. This comment is adopted largely as proposed, with changes to reflect the newly adopted § 1005.32(b)(2), which allows for estimates in certain disclosures for transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer, and the revised § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) and (a)(2)(i), which permit use of estimates under § 1005.32(b)(2). The comment also notes that when estimates are permitted, they must be disclosed in accordance with § 1005.31(d).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 36(b)-2 explains that, for a subsequent transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i), except for the temporal disclosures in that receipt required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) (Date Available) and (b)(2)(vii) (Transfer Date), applies to each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer unless and until it is superseded by a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(2)(i). For each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer, only the most recent receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i) must be accurate as of the date each subsequent transfer is made. As a receipt may apply to multiple transfers in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.</em> disclosure of the date in the foreign country on which funds will be available to the designated recipient) need not be accurate for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers that occur after the first transfer to which the receipt pertains.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Finally, new comment 36(b)-3 clarifies that a receipt required by § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) must accurately reflect the details of the transfer to which it pertains and may not contain estimates pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2). However, the remittance transfer provider may continue to disclose estimates to the extent permitted by § 1005.32(a) or (b)(1). In providing receipts pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) or (a)(2)(ii), § 1005.36(b)(2) and (b)(3) do not allow a remittance transfer provider to change figures previously disclosed on a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i), unless a figure was an estimate or based on an estimate disclosed pursuant to § 1005.32. Thus, for example, if a provider disclosed its fee as $10 in a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) and that receipt contained an estimate of the exchange rate pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2), the second receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) must also disclose the fee as $10. The Bureau is adopting this comment to clarify that the purpose of receipts required by § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) and (a)(2)(ii) is to provide a sender with the actual exchange rate applied to the transfer (unless the statutory exceptions for estimates apply) rather than the estimate previously disclosed for the transfer pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2). Thus, the final rule does not permit a provider to change other items, such as non-estimated fees and taxes, from a prior disclosure applicable to that transfer on the post-transfer receipt.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>36(c) Cancellation</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The February Final Rule contains cancellation requirements for remittance transfers. For most remittance transfers, § 1005.34(a) requires the remittance transfer provider to comply with a cancellation request received no later than 30 minutes after the sender makes payment for the remittance transfer if: (i) The sender's request allows the provider to identify the sender's name and address or telephone number and the specific transaction to be cancelled; and (ii) the transferred funds have not been picked up by the designated recipient or deposited into the recipient's account. For remittance transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, including preauthorized remittance transfers, § 1005.36(c) of the February Final Rule requires the remittance transfer provider to comply with a sender's request for cancellation if the request: (i) Enables the provider to identify the sender's name and address or telephone number and the particular transfer to be cancelled; and (ii) is received at least three business days before the scheduled date of the remittance transfer. Section 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) requires the provider to include a statement about the sender's cancellation rights, using the language set forth in Model Form A-37 of Appendix A to subpart B or substantially similar language.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is amending Regulation E in this final rule to, among other things, clarify the obligations of the remittance transfer provider for remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer and to provide senders with information to calculate the cancellation deadline for remittance transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer. As discussed above, the Bureau is making certain adjustments to the disclosure and timing requirements in other sections of the final rule in order to enhance senders' ability to properly determine the cancellation deadline for remittance transfers, to enable senders to more easily identify and track preauthorized remittance transfers that occur in close proximity to one another, and to facilitate industry compliance with the cancellation disclosure requirements.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the final rule adds § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii), which requires remittance transfer providers to disclose the date of transfer in certain receipts provided to senders pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(2). These requirements apply only to remittance transfers scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, as well as the initial transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers. As discussed below, § 1005.36(d)(2)(ii) also requires future transfer dates to be disclosed for subsequent transfers in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, for which payment is made by the sender four or fewer business days before the date of the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>However, as discussed below, the Bureau is retaining in § 1005.36(c) the requirement that a remittance transfer provider must comply with any oral or written request to cancel a remittance transfer if the request to cancel is received at least three business days before the scheduled date of the remittance transfer. The Bureau is also adopting a new § 1005.36(d) to require providers to disclose the future dates of transfer, cancellation requirements, and provider's contact information for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers no more than 12 months and no less than five business days before the date of the transfer. This timing requirement for these disclosures does not apply to subsequent transfers in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers for which payment is made by the sender four or fewer business days before the date of the transfer. For this subset of transfers, the information required by § 1005.36(d)(1), including future dates of transfer, must instead be included in the receipt for the first transfer in the series of preauthorized remittance transfers provided in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(1)(i). For subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers and transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of transfer, any receipt provided after the transfer is made in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) or (a)(2)(ii) must include the date of transfer (and cancellation requirements) for the transfer that is the subject of the receipt.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisSection>
          <title>The Three-Business-Day Deadline To Cancel</title>
          <analysisParagraph>As noted above, section 919(d)(3) of the EFTA provides the Bureau broad discretion to fashion cancellation requirements for remittance transfers. In the February Final Rule, the Bureau adopted in § 1005.36(c) specific cancellation requirements for remittance transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer. In adopting the three-business-day cancellation rule for such transfers, the Bureau explained that the general 30-minute cancellation period would not be appropriate for remittance transfers scheduled far in advance because it would permit only a short time for cancellation even though the remittance transfer might not occur for many days or even months. 77 FR 6194, 6268. Thus, the Bureau concluded that a three-business-day time period is more beneficial because it provides senders with more time to decide whether to go through with the transaction while giving remittance transfer providers sufficient time to process a cancellation request before the transaction is executed. <em data-original="E-03">Id.</em>
          </analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>In the February Proposal, the Bureau explained that further consideration of the three-business-day cancellation rule and its application to remittance transfers scheduled before the date of transfer was necessary to ensure that the rule provided appropriate protection to senders without imposing an undue burden on providers. 77 FR 6310, 6321. Accordingly, the Bureau solicited comment on whether the three-business-day deadline to cancel advance transfers accomplishes these goals, or whether the deadline to cancel should be more or less than the three days adopted in the February Final Rule. The Bureau also solicited comment on whether it is important to maintain consistency between the cancellation deadline adopted for preauthorized remittances transfers in § 1005.36(c) and the cancellation deadline for preauthorized electronic fund transfers in § 1005.10(c)(1). 77 FR 6310, 6321. Finally, the Bureau solicited comment on whether the deadline to cancel would be easier to calculate if the cancellation period was based on calendar days instead of business days.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Several commenters addressed the cancellation deadline for remittance transfers scheduled three or more business days in advance. Both industry and consumer group commenters generally agreed that the three-business-day time period for cancellation in the February Final Rule appropriately balances the interests of both parties to the transfer. One industry commenter opposed the three-business-day time period for cancellation; this commenter proposed as an alternative a five-day cancellation period, arguing that the Bureau should take into consideration providers' existing compliance obligations under other laws as well. Another industry commenter posited that, if the Bureau does not amend the definition of “remittance transfer provider” to exclude depository institutions executing certain types of international wire transfers, cancellation should be allowed only until a transfer has been executed by a depository institution. One industry commenter agreed that the Bureau should continue to require the deadline to cancel to be expressed in business days as opposed to calendar days.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Although most commenters expressed support for the three-business-day cancellation period, a few industry commenters conditioned their support on whether and to what extent remittance transfer providers may be required to disclose to senders the exchange rates that apply to transfers scheduled before the date of transfer. One industry commenter stated that the three-business-day cancellation period would be appropriate only if a remittance transfer provider were not required to disclose the actual exchange rates that would apply to preauthorized remittance transfers ten days before the dates of such transfers. The industry commenter, however, also agreed that senders should be able to cancel preauthorized remittance transfers or other remittance transfers scheduled to take place in the future, but that the cancellation requirements should be balanced with a shorter time period for exchange rate disclosure. Another industry commenter argued that the three-business-day cancellation requirement would present a substantial risk of loss to a remittance transfer provider if the provider were required to disclose the exchange rate that would apply to a remittance transfer more than one day before the scheduled date of transfer. This commenter suggested that the Bureau establish a bifurcated cancellation structure for transfers scheduled before the date of transfer under which: (i) the 30-minute cancellation period in § 1005.34(a) would apply for any transfer for which the provider discloses the actual exchange rate; and (ii) the three-business-day cancellation period established in § 1005.36(c) would apply for any transfer in which the provider discloses an estimated exchange rate.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau recognizes the concern expressed by a few industry commenters that remittance transfer providers may incur additional risk if the time period to cancel a transfer extends beyond the date upon which a remittance transfer provider must disclose the actual exchange rate that will apply to a remittance transfer. As the Bureau noted in the discussion regarding § 1005.32(b)(2)(i), whenever there are time lags between when the retail exchange rate that applies to a remittance transfer is set, when the relevant foreign currency is purchased, and when funds are delivered, a remittance transfer provider (and/or its business partner) may face losses due to unexpected changes in the value of the relevant foreign currency. The Bureau's decision in § 1005.32(b)(2) of the final rule to allow remittance transfer providers to provide an estimated exchange rate in certain disclosures for remittance transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer should help alleviate these concerns. (<em data-original="E-03">See</em> discussion above regarding § 1005.32(b)(2) for additional analysis of foreign exchange risks.) As a result, under the final rule, a remittance transfer provider will not be required to disclose, prior to the date of the transfer, an actual, as opposed to an estimated, exchange rate if the transfer is scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer. This five-business-day period is shorter than the more than ten day period proposed in the February Proposal and reduces the period during which a remittance transfer provider that permits transfers to be scheduled before the date of transfer may face additional foreign exchange risks due to the gap between the time the provider sets an exchange rate and the date of the transfer. And, while there is a short period outside the cancellation window in which the remittance transfer provider is required to disclose actual rather than estimated exchange rates, the Bureau believes that providers may be able to manage the foreign currency risks or may choose not to offer consumers the ability to schedule remittance transfers in this period. The Bureau does not believe the latter option presents a substantial risk of harm to senders, because it believes that any provider that generally permits consumers to schedule remittance transfers in advance will at least retain the option for consumers to schedule their transfers the day of or five or more business days before the date of the transfer.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, the Bureau concludes that the three-day-business cancellation period for remittance transfers scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer as adopted in the February Final Rule is appropriate. The Bureau believes that cancellation rights are important because they allow senders time to review the disclosure for accuracy and cancel the transaction when warranted by a change in circumstances. In addition, the Bureau believes the three-business-day cancellation period strikes an appropriate balance between sender and remittance transfer provider interests. This time period is close enough to the transfer date so that senders will know if there are circumstances warranting a cancellation, while it gives providers an adequate amount of time to process a cancellation request. Finally, as the Bureau noted in the February Final Rule, the three-business-day cancellation period is consistent with the cancellation requirement for electronic fund transfers. 77 FR 6194, 6268. Since many remittance transfer providers also provide electronic fund transfers, maintaining similar regulatory regimes should minimize burden and facilitate compliance.</analysisParagraph>

          <title>Disclosure of Cancellation Period in Pre-Payment Disclosures for Subsequent Preauthorized Remittance Transfers</title>
          <analysisParagraph>In the February Proposal, the Bureau solicited comment on whether a remittance transfer provider should be required to disclose the cancellation period in the pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent remittance transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, rather than in the receipt for each subsequent transfer. As the Bureau recognized in the February Proposal, this issue would be relevant only if the pre-payment disclosure requirement in § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) of the February Final Rule is retained in this rulemaking. 77 FR 6310, 6323.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau is revising the disclosure requirements for preauthorized remittance transfers to eliminate the requirement that remittance transfer providers provide a pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent transfer in series of preauthorized remittance transfers. Instead, the final rule requires that, in most circumstances, a receipt for each subsequent transfer be provided to the sender. Consequently, the Bureau's inquiry of whether the cancellation disclosure should be provided in the pre-payment disclosure or the receipt for each subsequent transfer is now generally moot. Since there generally is no longer a requirement to provide a pre-payment disclosure for subsequent transfers, the sender's cancellation rights must be disclosed on any receipt provided in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(2) and (d)(2) (<em data-original="E-03">see</em> discussion below), as applicable.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>36(d) Additional Requirements for Subsequent Preauthorized Remittance Transfers</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Under the February Final Rule, remittance transfer providers are required to provide senders with both a pre-payment disclosure and a receipt for each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer in a series. Specifically, the pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent transfer must be provided within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of the transfer, and the receipt for each subsequent transfer generally must be provided no later than one business day after the date on which the transfer is made. As discussed above, however, the Bureau is concerned with balancing the interest of consumers in receiving timely disclosures for subsequent transfers with the interests of industry in reducing risks and developing this market segment. Thus, in the February Proposal, the Bureau sought comment on a number of issues related to subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers, including whether senders should receive disclosures for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers and, if so, what form those disclosures should take. 77 FR 6310, 6223. The February Proposal also sought comment on what cancellation rules should apply to these transfers and when those rules should be disclosed to senders.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received few comments in response to its inquiry regarding disclosure of cancellation requirements for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. Among those received, there was little consensus regarding how cancellation rights for subsequent preauthorized transfers should be disclosed. One industry commenter advocated for flexibility on the disclosure requirements to minimize costs. Another industry commenter asserted that the cancellation rights should be included only in the first pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent transfer, while a consumer group commenter posited that a subsequent pre-payment disclosure disclosing cancellation rights should be sent before each subsequent transfer. Only one industry commenter supported including the statement regarding cancellation rights for the next scheduled transfer on the current receipt, arguing that it would give senders more time to cancel the transfer than if the cancellation rights were included in a pre-payment disclosure provided before the subsequent transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Having eliminated the pre-payment disclosure requirement for subsequent transfers and altered the requirements for when a receipt would have to be provided for a subsequent transfer in the final rule, the Bureau is concerned that senders may not receive adequate and timely information regarding the dates of upcoming transfers and, thus, may not know when their right to cancel those transfers expires. Further, as discussed above regarding § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii), even when senders receive disclosures regarding their cancellation rights, they may not have the type of information needed to determine the date on which the right to cancel a subsequent transfer expires. The Bureau is also concerned that, where senders receive a number of receipts in close proximity to one another as part of a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, senders may not have information that would be helpful in distinguishing to which transfer a particular receipt applies.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, to further the purposes of the EFTA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to use its authority under EFTA sections 904(a) and (c) to adopt a new § 1005.36(d), which amends the disclosure requirements for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. Section 1005.36(d)(1)(i) states that, for any subsequent transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the remittance transfer provider must disclose to the sender: (A) the date the provider will make the subsequent transfer, using the term “Future Transfer Date,” or a substantially similar term; (B) a statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation as described in § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv); and (C) the name, telephone number(s), and Web site of the remittance transfer provider. Section 1005.36(d)(1)(ii) states that if the future date or dates of transfer required to be disclosed by this paragraph are described as occurring in regular periodic intervals, <em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> the 15th of every month, rather than as a specific calendar date or dates, the remittance transfer provider must disclose any future date or dates of transfer that do not conform to the described interval.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Section 1005.36(d)(2)(i) establishes the general timing requirements for disclosures required by § 1005.36(d)(1), stating that, except as described in § 1005.36(d)(2)(ii), the disclosures required by § 1005.36(d)(1) must be received by the sender no more than 12 months, and no less than five business days prior to the date of any subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer to which it pertains. Section 1005.36(d)(2)(i) also states that the disclosures required by § 1005.36(d)(1) may be provided in a separate disclosure or on one or more disclosures required by subpart B related to the same series of preauthorized remittance transfers, so long as the consumer receives the required information for each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer in accordance with the timing requirements of § 1005.36(d)(2)(i).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that information regarding cancellation rights is as important to subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers as it is to other transfers. Accordingly, as noted in the discussion regarding § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii), senders need the date of transfer to determine, among other things, when the cancellation period for a certain preauthorized transfer expires. At the same time, the Bureau recognizes that when authorizing a preauthorized remittance transfer, the sender establishes a recurring schedule. The Bureau believes the repetitive and cyclical nature of preauthorized remittance transfers reduces the need for senders to receive notice of the cancellation period in individual notices sent immediately before each subsequent transfer, and warrants additional flexibility to remittance transfer providers to determine the timing and type of disclosure to be used to advise senders of their cancellation rights for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. The Bureau notes, however, that such notices must be provided within a timeframe that would be useful to senders and is concerned that a notice provided more than 12 months before the date of such transfers would likely be unhelpful to senders. Likewise, a notice received fewer than five business days before the date of transfer may not provide the sender with enough time to determine whether cancellation is warranted and, thus, would also not be helpful to senders.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also recognizes that for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers scheduled four or fewer business days before the date of the transfer, remittance transfer providers will be unable to provide the disclosures regarding the future date of transfer and cancellation rights five or more business days before the date of transfer. Accordingly, § 1005.36(d)(2)(ii) states that for any preauthorized remittance transfer for which the date of transfer is four or fewer business days after the date payment is made for that transfer, the information required by § 1005.36(d)(1) must be provided on or with the receipt described in § 1005.31(b)(2), or disclosed as permitted by § 1005.31(a)(3) and (a)(5), for the initial transfer in that series in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(1)(i). For example, if, on Monday, a sender authorizes a series of preauthorized remittance transfers in which the initial transfer occurs that day and the first subsequent transfer is scheduled to occur on Wednesday, the 30-minute cancellation period under § 1005.34(a) would apply to both transfers. If, however, in the same series of preauthorized remittance transfers the second subsequent remittance transfer is scheduled to occur on Friday, the three-business-day cancellation period would apply to that transfer. For either subsequent transfer, the provider would be unable to provide the required information at least five business days before the date of the transfer. In that instance, the provider would be required to disclose the cancellation period and future date of transfer for the subsequent remittance transfer on or with the receipt provided for the initial preauthorized remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As a result, preauthorized remittance transfers scheduled fewer than three business days from the date of the transfer are now subject to different disclosure requirements than standalone remittance transfers scheduled fewer than three business days from the date of the transfer. With respect to the latter, there is no requirement to disclose the date of transfer or future date of transfer on receipts. The Bureau, however, believes these two sets of transfers present different concerns warranting different treatment. Preauthorized remittance transfers by definition are authorized to recur at substantially regular intervals. As a result, as discussed above, preauthorized remittance transfer present a higher risk of confusion since, depending on the frequency of the subsequent transfers in the series, senders may receive multiple receipts at or around the same time and, absent identifying information such as the date of transfer, may be unable to identify the transfer to which a particular receipt applies. One-time transfers scheduled in advance do not generally present the same risks because in most instances the sender would schedule a single transfer at any given time as opposed to a series of transfers and should not have difficulty identifying the transfer to which the receipt applies. Further, if disclosures were only required for subsequent preauthorized transfers occurring at least three business days in the future, consumers may mistakenly believe that no transfers were scheduled on any days prior to that time.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Thus, while the Bureau believes the date of transfer would be helpful to senders of preauthorized remittance transfers, it does not believe such information is necessary for standalone transfers scheduled fewer than three business days from the date of the transfer. As stated above, the Bureau believes that it will be simpler for remittance transfer providers to program their receipts to include the transfer date information consistently for preauthorized transfers than to create separate receipt forms for one-time and preauthorized remittance transfers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New § 1005.36(d)(3) and (d)(4) address formatting and accuracy requirements for disclosures required under § 1005.36(d)(3). Section 1005.36(d)(3) states that the information required by § 1005.36(d)(1)(i)(A) generally must be disclosed in close proximity to the other information required by § 1005.36(d)(1)(i)(B). Section 1005.36(d)(4) states that any disclosure required by § 1005.36(d)(1) must be accurate as of the date the subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer to which it pertains is made.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adopting commentary to provide further guidance on the application of § 1005.36(d). Comment 36(d)-1 clarifies that § 1005.36(d)(2) permits remittance transfer providers some flexibility in determining how and when the disclosures required by § 1005.36(d)(1) may be provided to senders. Comment 36(d)-1 states that the disclosure may be provided as a separate disclosure, or on or with any other disclosures required by subpart B of Regulation E related to the same series of preauthorized remittance transfers, provided that the disclosure and timing requirements in § 1005.36(d)(2) and other applicable provisions in subpart B are satisfied. For example, the required disclosures may be made on or with a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i); a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(2)(ii); or in a separate disclosure created by the provider. The comment also provides a fact pattern describing how a remittance transfer provider would comply with § 1005.36(d)(1).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 36(d)-2 clarifies that § 1005.36(d)(2)(i) requires that the sender receive disclosure of the date of transfer, applicable cancellation requirements, and the provider's contact information no more than 12 months and no less than 5 business days prior to the date of the subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer. Comment 36(d)-2 also cross-references comment 36(a)(2)-3 for purposes of determining when a disclosure required by § 1005.36(d)(1) is received by the sender.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 36(d)-3 provides guidance on how the remittance transfer provider should disclose the date of transfer. Specifically, comment 36(d)-3 clarifies that the date of transfer of a subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer may be disclosed either as a specific date (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> July 19, 2013), or by using a method that clearly permits identification of the date of transfer, such as periodic intervals (<em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> the third Monday of every month, or the 15th of every month). Comment 36(d)-3 further clarifies that if the future dates of transfer are disclosed as occurring periodically and there is a break in the sequence, or the date of transfer does not conform to the described period, <em data-original="E-03">e.g.,</em> if a weekend or holiday causes the provider to deviate from the normal schedule, the provider should disclose the specific date of transfer for the affected transfer. Finally, comment 36(d)-4 clarifies the accuracy requirements for disclosures required by § 1005.36(d)(1). Comment 36(d)-4 explains that if any of the information required by § 1005.36(d)(1) changes, the provider must provide an updated disclosure with the revised information that is accurate as of when the transfer is made, pursuant to § 1005.36(d)(2).</analysisParagraph>

Proposed § 1005.18(c)(3) would have required financial institutions to disclose all fees assessed against the account, in any electronic or written account transaction histories and on periodic statements. In addition, the Bureau proposed in § 1005.18(c)(4) to require financial institutions to disclose, in any electronic or written account transaction histories and on periodic statements, monthly and annual summary totals of the amount of all fees imposed on the prepaid account, and the total amounts of deposits to and debits from the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting new § 1005.19(f)(2) to establish a delayed effective date of October 1, 2018 for the requirement to submit prepaid account agreements to the Bureau on a rolling basis pursuant to final § 1005.19(b). An issuer must submit to the Bureau no later than October 31, 2018 all prepaid account agreements it offers as of October 1, 2018. The Bureau continues to work to develop a streamlined electronic submission process, which it expects will be fully operational before final § 1005.19(b) becomes effective on October 1, 2018. The Bureau expects to provide technical specifications regarding the electronic submission process in advance of that date. Issuers will have no submission obligations under this provision until the Bureau has issued technical specifications addressing the form and manner for submission of agreements.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In addition, new § 1005.19(f)(3) provides that nothing in new § 1005.19(f)(2) shall affect the requirements to post prepaid account agreements on an issuer's Web site pursuant to final § 1005.19(c) and (d) or the requirement to provide a copy of the consumer's agreement to the consumer upon request pursuant to final § 1005.19(d).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting new comment 19(f)-1 to further explain that, if an issuer offers a prepaid account agreement on October 1, 2018, the issuer must submit the agreement to the Bureau, as required by § 1005.19(b), no later than October 31, 2018, which is 30 days after October 1, 2018. After October 1, 2018, issuers must submit on prepaid account agreements or notifications of withdrawn agreements to the Bureau within 30 days after offering, amending, or ceasing to offer the agreements.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is also adopting new comment 19(f)-2 to explain that, during the delayed agreement submission period set forth in new § 1005.19(f)(2), an issuer must post agreements on its Web site as required by final § 1005.19(c) and (d)(1)(i) using the agreements it would have otherwise submitted to the Bureau under final § 1005.19(b) and must provide a copy of the consumer's agreement to the consumer upon request pursuant to final § 1005.19(d)(1)(ii). For purposes of § 1005.19(c)(2) and (d)(2), agreements posted by an issuer on its Web site must conform to the form and content requirements set forth in final § 1005.19(b)(6). For purposes of final § 1005.19(c)(3) and (d)(2)(v), amended agreements must be posted to the issuer's Web site no later than 30 days after the change becomes effective as required by final § 1005.19(b)(2).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Prior to the October 1, 2018 effective date for the submission requirement in final § 1005.19(b), the Bureau will issue technical specifications addressing the form and manner for submission of agreements. The Bureau intends to publish a notice in the <em data-original="E-04">Federal Register</em> to inform issuers when its streamlined electronic submission process is operational in order to on-board all issuers in advance of the October 1, 2018 effective date.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau reminds credit card issuers that while final § 1005.19(h) provides a delayed effective date of October 1, 2018 to submit prepaid account agreements to the Bureau, the requirement to submit credit card agreements under Regulation Z § 1026.58 for covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards that are credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan becomes effective with the rest of this final rule on October 1, 2017.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>19(c) Posting of Agreements Offered to the General Public</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1005.19(c) to require an issuer to post and maintain on its publicly available Web site the prepaid account agreements that the issuer would be required to submit to the Bureau under proposed § 1005.19(b). Agreements posted pursuant to proposed § 1005.19(c) would have been required to conform to the form and content requirements for agreements submitted to the Bureau specified in proposed § 1005.19(b)(6)(i)(B) through (D) and would have been permitted to be posted in any electronic format that is readily usable by the general public. Agreements posted pursuant to proposed § 1005.19(c) would have been required to be accurate and updated whenever changes are made. Agreements would have been required to be placed in a location that is prominent and readily accessible by the public and without submission of personally identifiable information.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Regulation Z § 1026.58(d)(1) requires credit card issuers to update the agreements posted on their Web sites at least as frequently as the quarterly schedule required for submission of agreements to the Bureau, but permits an issuer to update its agreements more frequently if it so chooses. For Regulation Z, the Board considered a consumer group comment requesting that the online agreement be updated within a specific period of time no greater than 72 hours. The Board declined to adopt such a requirement because it believed that the burden to card issuers of updating agreements in such a short time would outweigh the benefit. In addition, the Board noted that if a consumer applies or is solicited for a credit card, the consumer will receive the updated disclosure under existing rules in Regulation Z subpart B.<footnote ref="549">75 FR 7658, 7772 (Feb. 22, 2010).</footnote>
             The Bureau believed that prepaid account issuers generally update their agreements posted online as changes are made. The Bureau did not believe that prepaid account issuers would face the same burdens as credit card issuers in updating prepaid account agreements posted online because the terms of such agreements do not vary in the same manner as credit card agreement terms, which may offer a variety of rates and fees depending on the creditworthiness of the consumer. Thus, for prepaid account agreements, the Bureau proposed in § 1005.19(c)(3) that prepaid account agreements posted only be accurate and that issuers update their agreements whenever changes are made.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 19(c)-1 would have explained that an issuer's obligation to post and maintain prepaid account agreements on its Web site pursuant to proposed § 1005.19(c) is distinct from that of § 1005.7, which requires an issuer to provide certain disclosures at the time a consumer contracts for an EFT service or before the first EFT is made involving the consumer's account, as well as the change-in-terms notice required under § 1005.8(a). This requirement would have also been distinct from that of proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii), which would have required issuers to make the long form disclosure available to consumers prior to prepaid account acquisition and which, depending on the methods an issuer offers prepaid accounts to consumers, would have required posting of the long form disclosure on the issuer's Web site. If, for example, an issuer is not required to submit any agreements to the Bureau because the issuer qualifies for the de minimis exception under proposed § 1005.19(b)(4), the issuer would not have been required to post and maintain any agreements on its Web site under proposed § 1005.19(c). The issuer would have still been required to provide each individual consumer with access to his or her specific prepaid account agreement under proposed § 1005.19(d), discussed below, by posting and maintaining the agreement on the issuer's Web site or by providing a copy of the agreement upon the consumer's request. The issuer may have also been required to post the long form disclosure required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii) online as well, depending on the methods by which the issuer offers prepaid accounts to consumers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 19(c)-2 would have explained that if an issuer provides consumers with access to specific information about their individual accounts, such as balance information or copies of statements, through a third-party Web site, the issuer would have been considered to maintain that Web site for purposes of proposed § 1005.19. Such a third-party Web site would have been deemed to be maintained by the issuer for purposes of proposed § 1005.19(c) even where, for example, an unaffiliated entity designs the Web site and owns and maintains the information technology infrastructure that supports the Web site, consumers with prepaid accounts from multiple issuers can access individual account information through the same Web site, and the Web site is not labeled, branded, or otherwise held out to the public as belonging to the issuer. Therefore, issuers that provide consumers with access to account-specific information through a third-party Web site would have been able to comply with proposed § 1005.19(c) by ensuring that the agreements the issuer submits to the Bureau are posted on the third-party Web site in accordance with proposed § 1005.19(c).
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.19(c) was similar to Regulation Z § 1026.58(d), but did not include provisions regarding private label credit cards, as discussed above. Specifically, the Bureau did not propose an equivalent to the provision addressing the Web site to be used for posting private label credit card agreements in Regulation Z § 1026.58(d)(1) as well as Regulation Z § 1026.58(d)(4) requiring quarterly updates of credit card agreements posted on card issuers' Web sites, as discussed above. Proposed comment 19(c)-1 was similar to Regulation Z comment 58(d)-1, although the Bureau had modified it to distinguish the requirement in proposed § 1005.19(c) from other disclosure-related obligations in Regulation E. Proposed comment 19(c)-2 would have mirrored Regulation Z comment 58(d)-2, although the Bureau had modified both it and proposed comment 19(c)-1 to remove the portions discussing the private label credit card exception. An equivalent to Regulation Z comment 58(d)-3, regarding private label credit card plans, was likewise omitted.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received comments from consumer groups, State government agencies, and industry commenters (including trade associations, credit unions, a program manager, and a payment network) regarding the proposed posting requirement in § 1005.19(c).<footnote ref="550">These commenters generally addressed the public posting requirements in proposed § 1005.19(b) and (c) together. There are thus some overlaps between the comments summarized here and those in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.19(b) under &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Bureau Posting of Prepaid Account Agreements&lt;/em&gt; above.</footnote>
             The industry commenters argued that the proposed posting requirement would burden industry and provide little to no consumer benefit. These commenters explained that the proposed requirement would be problematic for issuers as they would have to constantly update their Web site with new and revised agreements. One of the credit unions argued that the requirement would be an intrusion into its business practices, but also stated that issuers already post agreements online without direction from the Bureau. Several commenters expressed concern that the version of an agreement on the Bureau's Web site might differ from the version on the issuer's Web site, causing consumer confusion.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.19(a)(8) above, several industry commenters, including issuing banks, industry trade associations, program managers, a think tank, and a law firm writing on behalf of a coalition of prepaid issuers, urged the Bureau to exclude agreements that are not offered to the public (such as payroll card, government benefit, and campus card accounts) from the requirement in proposed § 1005.19(c) to post agreements to the issuer's publicly available Web site. These commenters explained that for these types of accounts, an issuer could have thousands of agreements that have been negotiated between the issuer and a third party (such as an employer, a government agency, or a university) and that are often tailored to fit the needs of individual programs. These commenters stated that such volume and variety would clutter the issuer's Web site, overwhelm consumers, and cause confusion because consumers might not understand which agreement applies to their account or why the terms differ. These commenters stated that even if consumers could navigate the volume of agreements, the third party—not the consumers—chooses these agreements, so comparison shopping would not be an option. In addition, these commenters stated that the public posting of these agreements raises confidentiality concerns regarding the disclosure of proprietary account features, which would compromise the issuer's ability to negotiate customized account agreements. These commenters also argued that a public posting requirement would undermine competition because it would inhibit the incentive for companies to develop novel products.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several consumer groups and the office of a State Attorney General supported a requirement to post all agreements, including agreements that are not offered to the public, on the issuer's public Web site because they believed it would encourage competition and transparency, which they stated would help lower fees, and facilitate comparison shopping, which they stated would result in better informed consumer decisions. One consumer group argued that the public posting of agreements would assist the Bureau, researchers, and consumer advocates in compiling information to issue reports and shed light on inappropriate practices by some market participants.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to publicly posting agreements that are not offered to the public, one consumer group explained that the payroll card market, in particular, is secretive and issuers and employers in this market do not generally provide fee schedules when asked. This commenter added that when it began issuing reports on unemployment compensation cards, fees started to come down. This commenter also argued that employers, government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and other entities considering a prepaid card program would be able to see and compare the various terms offered in the market. This commenter further argued that, while payroll card issuers may have confidentiality clauses in their contracts with employers, those clauses do not bind employees because once the card is issued to an employee, the agreement is no longer confidential. Finally, the office of a State Attorney General argued that even though consumers who enroll in payroll card programs are not typically able to comparison shop because the employer selects their program, they would still be able to compare their plan with wage other payment options, such as a checking account, direct deposit, and other prepaid accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Regarding whether the Bureau should specify a timeframe for updating agreements posted on the issuer's Web site, one credit union requested that the Bureau not designate a timeframe, and one consumer group requested that the Bureau require issuers to post agreements within seven business days of issuing the agreement.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is finalizing § 1005.19(c) generally as proposed, with several modifications. The Bureau has revised § 1005.19(c)(1) to exclude prepaid account agreements that are not offered to the general public from the requirement that issuers post agreements to their publicly available Web sites. In addition, the Bureau has revised § 1005.19(c)(3) to clarify that an issuer must post on its publicly available Web site and update the posted agreements as frequently as the issuer is required to submit new and amended agreements to the Bureau pursuant to § 1005.19(b). The Bureau has also made several minor revisions for clarity and consistency.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau continues to believe that the general requirement to post prepaid account agreements on the issuer's publicly available Web site will increase transparency in the terms of these agreements and the amounts of the fees assessed against the prepaid accounts. The increased transparency will allow the public and consumers to become better informed about these accounts, which will likely encourage competition and improve fees in the various markets. Furthermore, the public posting of agreements will allow consumers to compare the terms and fees among various agreements. In addition, the Bureau does not believe this general requirement will be problematic for issuers, as posting agreements on the issuer's Web site is consistent with industry practice today.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is persuaded, however, that posting to the issuer's publicly available Web site agreements that are not offered to the general public may impose unnecessary administrative burden and have little consumer benefit. The Bureau understands that issuers of payroll card, government benefit, campus card, and other types of accounts whose agreements are not offered to the general public could potentially have thousands of agreements to post and maintain on their publicly available Web sites, which could take a considerable amount of time and resources to set up and maintain without necessarily being easy for consumers to navigate. In addition, the Bureau believes that consumers who use these types of accounts would not likely visit the issuer's general Web site to access their individual agreements. The Bureau notes that issuers of these accounts are still required to provide each individual consumer with access to his or her specific prepaid account agreement under § 1005.19(d), discussed below, and to submit the agreements to the Bureau under § 1005.19(b) (unless the de minimis exception under final § 1005.19(b)(4) or the product testing exception under final § 1005.19(b)(5) applies). In contrast, the Bureau believes that there are benefits to consumers and third parties in having agreements not available to the general public posted all in one place on the Bureau's Web site. See the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.19(a)(8) above.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is finalizing comments 19(c)-1 and -2 generally as proposed, with several modifications for clarity and consistency with the revisions to § 1005.19(c) discussed above.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Final comment 19(c)-1 explains the differences between final § 1005.19(c) and other provisions in § 1005.19, as well as other requirements elsewhere in of Regulation E, and clarifies that, for agreements that are not offered to the general public, the issuer is not required to post and maintain the agreements on its publicly available Web site, but is still required to provide each individual consumer with access to his or her specific prepaid account agreement under § 1005.19(d). This comment also clarifies the requirements for issuers that are not required to submit agreements to the Bureau because they qualify for the de minimis exception under § 1005.19(b)(4) or the agreements qualify for the product testing exception under § 1005.19(b)(5). In addition, this final comment does not contain the proposed explanation that an issuer that is not required to submit agreements to the Bureau may be required to post the long form disclosure required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii) online, depending on the methods by which the issuer offers prepaid accounts to consumers, as the Bureau does not believe it is necessary to include this clarification in commentary.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Final comment 19(c)-2 explains that, if an issuer offers an agreement to the general public as defined by § 1005.19(a)(6), that issuer must post that agreement on a publicly available Web site it maintains. If an issuer provides consumers with access to specific information about their individual accounts, such as balance information or copies of statements, through a third-party Web site, the issuer is considered to maintain that Web site for purposes of § 1005.19. Such a third-party Web site is deemed to be maintained by the issuer for purposes of § 1005.19(c) even where, for example, an unaffiliated entity designs the Web site and owns and maintains the information technology infrastructure that supports the Web site, consumers with prepaid accounts from multiple issuers can access individual account information through the same Web site, and the Web site is not labeled, branded, or otherwise held out to the public as belonging to the issuer. Therefore, issuers that provide consumers with access to account-specific information through a third-party Web site can comply with § 1005.19(c) by ensuring that the agreements the issuer submits to the Bureau are posted on the third-party Web site in accordance with § 1005.19(c).</analysisParagraph>

        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received comments from consumer groups, State government agencies, and industry commenters (including trade associations, credit unions, a program manager, and a payment network) regarding the proposed posting requirement in § 1005.19(c).<footnote ref="550">These commenters generally addressed the public posting requirements in proposed § 1005.19(b) and (c) together. There are thus some overlaps between the comments summarized here and those in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.19(b) under &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Bureau Posting of Prepaid Account Agreements&lt;/em&gt; above.</footnote>
             The industry commenters argued that the proposed posting requirement would burden industry and provide little to no consumer benefit. These commenters explained that the proposed requirement would be problematic for issuers as they would have to constantly update their Web site with new and revised agreements. One of the credit unions argued that the requirement would be an intrusion into its business practices, but also stated that issuers already post agreements online without direction from the Bureau. Several commenters expressed concern that the version of an agreement on the Bureau's Web site might differ from the version on the issuer's Web site, causing consumer confusion.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Furthermore, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.19(a)(8) above, several industry commenters, including issuing banks, industry trade associations, program managers, a think tank, and a law firm writing on behalf of a coalition of prepaid issuers, urged the Bureau to exclude agreements that are not offered to the public (such as payroll card, government benefit, and campus card accounts) from the requirement in proposed § 1005.19(c) to post agreements to the issuer's publicly available Web site. These commenters explained that for these types of accounts, an issuer could have thousands of agreements that have been negotiated between the issuer and a third party (such as an employer, a government agency, or a university) and that are often tailored to fit the needs of individual programs. These commenters stated that such volume and variety would clutter the issuer's Web site, overwhelm consumers, and cause confusion because consumers might not understand which agreement applies to their account or why the terms differ. These commenters stated that even if consumers could navigate the volume of agreements, the third party—not the consumers—chooses these agreements, so comparison shopping would not be an option. In addition, these commenters stated that the public posting of these agreements raises confidentiality concerns regarding the disclosure of proprietary account features, which would compromise the issuer's ability to negotiate customized account agreements. These commenters also argued that a public posting requirement would undermine competition because it would inhibit the incentive for companies to develop novel products.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several consumer groups and the office of a State Attorney General supported a requirement to post all agreements, including agreements that are not offered to the public, on the issuer's public Web site because they believed it would encourage competition and transparency, which they stated would help lower fees, and facilitate comparison shopping, which they stated would result in better informed consumer decisions. One consumer group argued that the public posting of agreements would assist the Bureau, researchers, and consumer advocates in compiling information to issue reports and shed light on inappropriate practices by some market participants.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to publicly posting agreements that are not offered to the public, one consumer group explained that the payroll card market, in particular, is secretive and issuers and employers in this market do not generally provide fee schedules when asked. This commenter added that when it began issuing reports on unemployment compensation cards, fees started to come down. This commenter also argued that employers, government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and other entities considering a prepaid card program would be able to see and compare the various terms offered in the market. This commenter further argued that, while payroll card issuers may have confidentiality clauses in their contracts with employers, those clauses do not bind employees because once the card is issued to an employee, the agreement is no longer confidential. Finally, the office of a State Attorney General argued that even though consumers who enroll in payroll card programs are not typically able to comparison shop because the employer selects their program, they would still be able to compare their plan with wage other payment options, such as a checking account, direct deposit, and other prepaid accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Regarding whether the Bureau should specify a timeframe for updating agreements posted on the issuer's Web site, one credit union requested that the Bureau not designate a timeframe, and one consumer group requested that the Bureau require issuers to post agreements within seven business days of issuing the agreement.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is finalizing § 1005.19(c) generally as proposed, with several modifications. The Bureau has revised § 1005.19(c)(1) to exclude prepaid account agreements that are not offered to the general public from the requirement that issuers post agreements to their publicly available Web sites. In addition, the Bureau has revised § 1005.19(c)(3) to clarify that an issuer must post on its publicly available Web site and update the posted agreements as frequently as the issuer is required to submit new and amended agreements to the Bureau pursuant to § 1005.19(b). The Bureau has also made several minor revisions for clarity and consistency.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau continues to believe that the general requirement to post prepaid account agreements on the issuer's publicly available Web site will increase transparency in the terms of these agreements and the amounts of the fees assessed against the prepaid accounts. The increased transparency will allow the public and consumers to become better informed about these accounts, which will likely encourage competition and improve fees in the various markets. Furthermore, the public posting of agreements will allow consumers to compare the terms and fees among various agreements. In addition, the Bureau does not believe this general requirement will be problematic for issuers, as posting agreements on the issuer's Web site is consistent with industry practice today.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is persuaded, however, that posting to the issuer's publicly available Web site agreements that are not offered to the general public may impose unnecessary administrative burden and have little consumer benefit. The Bureau understands that issuers of payroll card, government benefit, campus card, and other types of accounts whose agreements are not offered to the general public could potentially have thousands of agreements to post and maintain on their publicly available Web sites, which could take a considerable amount of time and resources to set up and maintain without necessarily being easy for consumers to navigate. In addition, the Bureau believes that consumers who use these types of accounts would not likely visit the issuer's general Web site to access their individual agreements. The Bureau notes that issuers of these accounts are still required to provide each individual consumer with access to his or her specific prepaid account agreement under § 1005.19(d), discussed below, and to submit the agreements to the Bureau under § 1005.19(b) (unless the de minimis exception under final § 1005.19(b)(4) or the product testing exception under final § 1005.19(b)(5) applies). In contrast, the Bureau believes that there are benefits to consumers and third parties in having agreements not available to the general public posted all in one place on the Bureau's Web site. See the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.19(a)(8) above.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is finalizing comments 19(c)-1 and -2 generally as proposed, with several modifications for clarity and consistency with the revisions to § 1005.19(c) discussed above.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Final comment 19(c)-1 explains the differences between final § 1005.19(c) and other provisions in § 1005.19, as well as other requirements elsewhere in of Regulation E, and clarifies that, for agreements that are not offered to the general public, the issuer is not required to post and maintain the agreements on its publicly available Web site, but is still required to provide each individual consumer with access to his or her specific prepaid account agreement under § 1005.19(d). This comment also clarifies the requirements for issuers that are not required to submit agreements to the Bureau because they qualify for the de minimis exception under § 1005.19(b)(4) or the agreements qualify for the product testing exception under § 1005.19(b)(5). In addition, this final comment does not contain the proposed explanation that an issuer that is not required to submit agreements to the Bureau may be required to post the long form disclosure required by proposed § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii) online, depending on the methods by which the issuer offers prepaid accounts to consumers, as the Bureau does not believe it is necessary to include this clarification in commentary.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Final comment 19(c)-2 explains that, if an issuer offers an agreement to the general public as defined by § 1005.19(a)(6), that issuer must post that agreement on a publicly available Web site it maintains. If an issuer provides consumers with access to specific information about their individual accounts, such as balance information or copies of statements, through a third-party Web site, the issuer is considered to maintain that Web site for purposes of § 1005.19. Such a third-party Web site is deemed to be maintained by the issuer for purposes of § 1005.19(c) even where, for example, an unaffiliated entity designs the Web site and owns and maintains the information technology infrastructure that supports the Web site, consumers with prepaid accounts from multiple issuers can access individual account information through the same Web site, and the Web site is not labeled, branded, or otherwise held out to the public as belonging to the issuer. Therefore, issuers that provide consumers with access to account-specific information through a third-party Web site can comply with § 1005.19(c) by ensuring that the agreements the issuer submits to the Bureau are posted on the third-party Web site in accordance with § 1005.19(c).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>19(a)(7) Open Account</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1005.19(a)(6) to provide that for purposes of proposed § 1005.19, a prepaid account is an “open account,” or “open prepaid account,” if (i) there is an outstanding balance in the prepaid account; (ii) if the consumer can load funds to the account even if the account does not currently hold a balance; or (iii) the consumer can access credit through a credit plan that would be a credit card account under Regulation Z (12 CFR part 1026) that is offered in connection with a prepaid account. A prepaid account that has been suspended temporarily (for example, due to a report by the consumer of unauthorized use of the card) would have been considered an open account or open prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 19(a)(6)-1 would have explained that a prepaid account that meets any of the criteria set forth in proposed § 1005.19(a)(6) is considered open even if the issuer considers the account inactive. The term open account was used in the provisions regarding the de minimis and product testing exceptions in proposed § 1005.19(b)(4) and (5) and the requirements in proposed § 1005.19(d) for agreements not submitted to the Bureau, discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1005.19(a)(6) was similar to the definition of open account or open credit card account in Regulation Z § 1026.58(b)(6). While Regulation Z § 1026.58(b)(6) defines an open credit card account as one in which the cardholder can obtain extensions of credit on the account, or there is an outstanding balance on the account that has not been charged off, the Bureau modified the definition to better reflect what it believed constitutes an open account in the prepaid context. Proposed § 1005.19(a)(6) would have included the explanation used in Regulation Z § 1026.58(b)(6), which provides that an account that has been suspended temporarily (for example, due to a report by the consumer of unauthorized use of the card) is nonetheless considered an open account. Proposed comment 19(a)(6)-1 was similar to Regulation Z comment 58(b)(6)-1, with modifications to reflect the terms of proposed § 1005.19(a)(6).</analysisParagraph>

Accordingly, the Bureau is finalizing § 1005.19(a)(6), renumbered as § 1005.19(a)(7), largely as proposed, with revisions to reflect the changes in final Regulation Z § 1026.61 regarding hybrid prepaid-credit cards. Specifically, final § 1005.19(a)(6) provides, in part, that for the purposes of § 1005.19, a prepaid account is an “open account” or “open prepaid account” if the consumer can access credit from a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in Regulation Z § 1026.61, in connection with the account. The Bureau is also finalizing comment 19(a)(6)-1, renumbered as comment 19(a)(7)-1, as proposed, with minor revisions for clarity.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>19(a)(4) Issuer</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1005.19(a)(4) to define “issuer” or “prepaid account issuer” for purposes of proposed § 1005.19 as the entity to which a consumer is legally obligated, or would be legally obligated, under the terms of a prepaid account agreement. Proposed § 1005.19(a)(4) would have mirrored the definition of card issuer in Regulation Z § 1026.58(b)(4).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In some cases, more than one financial institution is involved in the administration of a prepaid program. For example, a smaller bank may partner with a larger bank to market prepaid accounts to the smaller bank's customers, or a bank may partner with a program manager to offer prepaid accounts. The Bureau understands that the terms of the arrangements can vary, for example with respect to which party uses its name and brand in marketing materials, sets fees and terms, conducts customer identification and verification, provides access to account information, holds the pooled account, and absorbs the risk of default or fraud.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Board believed that with respect to the definition of card issuer in what is now Regulation Z § 1026.58(b)(4), without a bright-line rule defining which institution is the issuer, institutions might find it difficult to determine their obligations under § 1026.58.<footnote ref="532">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 76 FR 22948, 22987 (Apr. 25, 2011).</footnote>
             Similarly, absent clarification from the Bureau, the Bureau was concerned that it may be difficult to determine which entity would be responsible for compliance with proposed § 1005.19 for a particular prepaid account. For example, if two financial institutions are involved in issuing a prepaid program, one may have fewer than 3,000 open accounts while the other has more than 3,000 open accounts. It may be difficult to determine whether, for example, the de minimis exception in proposed § 1005.19(b)(4) applies in such cases. In addition, it may be unclear which institution is obligated to post and maintain the agreements on its Web site pursuant to proposed § 1005.19(c) or (d)(1)(i) or respond to telephone requests for copies of agreements pursuant to proposed § 1005.19(d)(1)(ii), discussed below. The Bureau therefore believed it would be beneficial to clarify which institution would be the prepaid account issuer for purposes of proposed § 1005.19. The Bureau thus proposed to define the term issuer in proposed § 1005.19(a)(4) as described above.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 19(a)(4)-1, which mirrors Regulation Z comment 58(b)(4)-1, would have provided an example of how the definition of issuer would have applied when more than one bank is involved in a prepaid program.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 19(a)(4)-2, which mirrors Regulation Z comment 58(b)(4)-2, would have explained that while an issuer has a legal obligation to comply with the requirements of proposed § 1005.19, it generally may use a third-party service provider to satisfy its obligations under proposed § 1005.19, provided that the issuer acts in accordance with regulatory guidance regarding the use of third-party service providers and other applicable regulatory guidance. In some cases, an issuer may wish to arrange for the entity with which it partners to issue prepaid accounts to fulfill the requirements of proposed § 1005.19 on the issuer's behalf. Proposed comment 19(a)(4)-2 would have provided an example describing such an arrangement between a bank and a program manager.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 19(a)(4)-3, which mirrors Regulation Z comment 58(b)(4)-3.i, would have noted that, as explained in proposed comment 19(c)-2, if an issuer provides consumers with access to specific information about their individual accounts, such as providing electronic history of consumers' account transactions pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii), through a third-party Web site, the issuer would have been deemed to maintain that Web site for purposes of proposed § 1005.19. Such a Web site would have been deemed to be maintained by the issuer for purposes of proposed § 1005.19 even where, for example, an unaffiliated entity designs the Web site and owns and maintains the information technology infrastructure that supports the Web site, consumers with prepaid accounts from multiple issuers can access individual account information through the same Web site, and the Web site is not labeled, branded, or otherwise held out to the public as belonging to the issuer. A partner institution's Web site would have been considered an example of a third-party Web site that may be deemed to be maintained by the issuer for purposes of proposed § 1005.19. Proposed comment 19(a)(4)-3 would have provided an example describing such an arrangement between a bank and a program manager.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not propose a comment similar to that of Regulation Z comment 58(b)(4)-3.ii which addresses Web site posting of private label credit card plans, as the Bureau did not believe such a comment was relevant for prepaid accounts, as discussed below.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>In the proposal, the Bureau acknowledged that an institution that partners with multiple other entities to issue prepaid accounts, such as in the payroll card account context, will in many cases use the same agreement for all of the prepaid accounts issued in connection with those arrangements. Therefore, while the number of prepaid accounts issued with a given partner may be small, the total number of consumers subject to the corresponding agreement may be quite large. The Bureau solicited comment on whether submission of a separate agreement for each issuer is the best approach in this situation or whether such agreements should be submitted in some other manner. The Bureau received comments from one consumer group regarding this issue, stating that a single agreement could be submitted as long as the agreement is labeled and searchable in such a way that the names of the multiple entities are listed on it. This commenter explained that this approach would enable the public to see that the agreement is the same for several entities, without having to spend time reviewing each agreement. The Bureau did not receive any other comments on this portion of the proposal.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is finalizing § 1005.19(a)(4) and its related commentary substantially as proposed, with several revisions for clarity. The Bureau has also changed the name of final comment 19(a)(4)-3 from <em data-original="E-03">Partner Institution Web sites</em> as proposed to <em data-original="E-03">Third-Party Web sites</em> because the content of the comment is primarily related to third-party Web sites; a partner institution Web site is merely an example of a third-party Web site that may be deemed to be maintained by the issuer for purposes of final § 1005.19.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau continues to believe that the definition of issuer creates a bright-line rule that will enable institutions involved in issuing prepaid accounts to determine their obligations under final § 1005.19. The Bureau also believes that the definition is consistent with the actual legal relationship into which a consumer enters under a prepaid account agreement. In addition, the Bureau believes that the institution to which the consumer is legally obligated under the agreement may be in the best position to provide accurate, up-to-date agreements to both the Bureau and consumers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Regarding situations in which an institution partners with multiple other entities to issue prepaid accounts, the Bureau is adopting new comment 19(b)(1)-2, to explain that if a program manager offers prepaid account agreements in conjunction with multiple issuers, each issuer must submit its own agreement to the Bureau. This comment also explains that each issuer may use the program manager to submit the agreement on its behalf, in accordance with final comment 19(a)(4)-2. Because the number and the role of the entities involved in a particular prepaid account agreement may vary, the Bureau believes it is clearer to require issuers, not program managers (or other parties), to submit these agreements to the Bureau. In addition, the Bureau believes that submitting a separate agreement for each issuer, rather than submitting one agreement with multiple issuers listed, as suggested by one commenter, will be less confusing to consumers and other parties reviewing agreements on the Bureau's Web site in the future.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1005.19(a)(4) to define “issuer” or “prepaid account issuer” for purposes of proposed § 1005.19 as the entity to which a consumer is legally obligated, or would be legally obligated, under the terms of a prepaid account agreement. Proposed § 1005.19(a)(4) would have mirrored the definition of card issuer in Regulation Z § 1026.58(b)(4).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In some cases, more than one financial institution is involved in the administration of a prepaid program. For example, a smaller bank may partner with a larger bank to market prepaid accounts to the smaller bank's customers, or a bank may partner with a program manager to offer prepaid accounts. The Bureau understands that the terms of the arrangements can vary, for example with respect to which party uses its name and brand in marketing materials, sets fees and terms, conducts customer identification and verification, provides access to account information, holds the pooled account, and absorbs the risk of default or fraud.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Board believed that with respect to the definition of card issuer in what is now Regulation Z § 1026.58(b)(4), without a bright-line rule defining which institution is the issuer, institutions might find it difficult to determine their obligations under § 1026.58.<footnote ref="532">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; 76 FR 22948, 22987 (Apr. 25, 2011).</footnote>
             Similarly, absent clarification from the Bureau, the Bureau was concerned that it may be difficult to determine which entity would be responsible for compliance with proposed § 1005.19 for a particular prepaid account. For example, if two financial institutions are involved in issuing a prepaid program, one may have fewer than 3,000 open accounts while the other has more than 3,000 open accounts. It may be difficult to determine whether, for example, the de minimis exception in proposed § 1005.19(b)(4) applies in such cases. In addition, it may be unclear which institution is obligated to post and maintain the agreements on its Web site pursuant to proposed § 1005.19(c) or (d)(1)(i) or respond to telephone requests for copies of agreements pursuant to proposed § 1005.19(d)(1)(ii), discussed below. The Bureau therefore believed it would be beneficial to clarify which institution would be the prepaid account issuer for purposes of proposed § 1005.19. The Bureau thus proposed to define the term issuer in proposed § 1005.19(a)(4) as described above.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 19(a)(4)-1, which mirrors Regulation Z comment 58(b)(4)-1, would have provided an example of how the definition of issuer would have applied when more than one bank is involved in a prepaid program.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>36(a)(2) Timing of Disclosures for Subsequent Preauthorized Remittance Transfers</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The February Final Rule contains disclosure provisions specific to subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers (<em data-original="E-03">i.e.,</em> all preauthorized remittance transfers after the first in the series of transfers). Section 1005.36(a)(2)(i) of the February Final Rule requires that a remittance transfer provider also mail or deliver a pre-payment disclosure to the sender for each subsequent transfer and requires the disclosure to be mailed or delivered within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of each subsequent transfer. This provision is in lieu of the general timing rule, which would have required that a pre-payment disclosure for each transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers be given at the time of the initial request (and thus a sender would receive a disclosure for every preauthorized transfer when requesting the entire series). <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.31(e)(1). Section 1005.36(a)(2)(ii) in the February Final Rule requires a receipt to be mailed or delivered no later than one business day after the transfer or, for account-based transactions, on or with the next regularly scheduled periodic statement or within 30 days after payment is made for the remittance transfer if a periodic statement is not provided.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In the February Proposal, the Bureau sought comment on an alternative to the requirement in the February Final Rule that a pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfer be provided within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of transfer: Whether the pre-payment disclosure requirement for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers should be eliminated.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters generally favored eliminating the requirement for providing pre-payment disclosures for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers for many of the same reasons these commenters disfavored a rule requiring accurate pre-payment disclosures for other transfers scheduled before the date of transfer. These commenters argued that a pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent transfer would be unnecessary, potentially confusing to senders, and burdensome to providers. For example, one commenter argued that senders schedule preauthorized remittance transfers for purposes of convenience and that senders typically do not comparison shop to complete each recurring transfer. The same commenter expressed concern that the requirement of an additional pre-payment disclosure might cause some providers to no longer allow consumers to schedule transfers before the date of transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In contrast, one consumer group commenter supported requiring pre-payment disclosures to be provided to senders ten days before each subsequent transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers (and stated that if estimates were permitted for disclosures related to such transfers, that those disclosures contain current estimates). This commenter urged that the Bureau maintain the requirement in the February Final Rule for pre-payment disclosures so that senders have additional information regarding the details of each preauthorized remittance transfer prior to such transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Upon consideration of these comments and to facilitate compliance, the Bureau is eliminating the requirement to provide a pre-payment disclosure within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer. Thus, the Bureau is eliminating what was § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) in the February Final Rule. The Bureau is doing so for several reasons. The Bureau is concerned that the requirement in the February Final Rule—a pre-payment disclosure sent a reasonable time prior to each subsequent remittance transfer—might provide senders only a limited amount of information because pre-payment disclosures for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers sent five or more business days before the date of transfer could contain estimates, pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2). In addition, in some scenarios, this could create a potential for confusing and overlapping disclosures and receipts.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Conversely, the Bureau believes that if it mandated that pre-payment disclosures be sent less than five business days before a subsequent transfer such that the disclosures could not contain estimates under § 1005.32(b)(2), the disclosure would be of little use to the sender for the upcoming transfer as it could be received too close to (or after) the cancellation deadline. Separately, confusion for senders could exist in some circumstances where preauthorized remittance transfers are scheduled relatively close together or receipts are provided with periodic statements. In these cases, a sender might receive a post-transfer receipt from a prior preauthorized remittance transfer close in time to a pre-payment disclosure for the next transfer. These documents, with potentially differing exchange rates and other figures, might confuse senders unnecessarily.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also believes that eliminating the requirement for pre-payment disclosures for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers is appropriate in part because senders will receive some relevant information in receipts for prior preauthorized remittance transfers. The final rule requires that for any preauthorized remittance transfer, the remittance transfer provider must provide a sender a receipt with accurate information (except to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32(a) or (b)(1)). A receipt from the prior transfer with accurate amounts may provide the sender with information that could educate the sender not only about the prior transfer but also about the provider's practices generally, which may help the sender judge whether to continue with the provider for future preauthorized remittance transfers. The Bureau believes a sender can learn about a remittance transfer provider's exchange rate practices from what the designated recipient actually received from the prior transfers in the series. In addition, the receipt provided for the initial transfer in a series provides information about the fees and taxes that will apply to all subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers, unless a change necessitates a new disclosure, as discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Although the Bureau is eliminating the requirement that a remittance transfer provider provide a pre-payment disclosure for each subsequent transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the Bureau remains concerned that previously disclosed figures (other than the estimates themselves) could change, rendering the figures disclosed in the pre-payment disclosure provided for the initial transfer inaccurate as applied to the subsequent transfers.<footnote ref="18">Although changes in terms trigger notice requirements in some instances under Regulation E (&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; 12 CFR 1005.10), that provision does not apply to remittance transfers that are not electronic fund transfers.</footnote>
             Comment 31(f)-1 to the February Final Rule explains that under the general timing and accuracy rules in subpart B of Regulation E, providers must give senders new pre-payment disclosures before accepting payment if previously provided pre-payment disclosures are inaccurate. However, since a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or, as discussed below, .36(a)(2)(i), may serve as a disclosure with respect to multiple subsequent preauthorized transfers, the temporal elements disclosed on those receipts would only be accurate with respect to the transfer to occur after the receipt is provided.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Thus, the Bureau is adopting a new § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) to specifically address certain changes in terms related to subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. Section 1005.36(a)(2)(i) states that if any of the information on the most recent receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or § 1005.36(a)(2)(i), other than the temporal disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) (Date Available) and (b)(2)(vii) (Transfer Date), is no longer accurate with respect to a subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer for reasons other than as permitted by § 1005.32, then the remittance transfer provider must provide an updated receipt meeting the requirements described in § 1005.31(b)(2) to the sender. The provider must mail or deliver this receipt to the sender within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of the next subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer. Such receipt must clearly and conspicuously indicate that it contains updated disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 36(a)(2)-1 clarifies when the disclosure required by § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) must be provided. Specifically, it states that when a sender schedules a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the provider is generally not required to provide a pre-payment disclosure prior to the date of each subsequent transfer. However, § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) requires the provider to provide a pre-payment disclosure and receipt for the first in the series of preauthorized remittance transfers in accordance with the timing requirements set forth in § 1005.31(e). <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.36(a)(1)(i). While certain information in those disclosures is expressly permitted to be estimated (<em data-original="E-03">see</em> § 1005.32(b)(2)(i) through (iii)), other information is not permitted to be estimated, or is limited in how it may be estimated. When any of the information on the most recent receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i), other than the temporal disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) (the Date Available) and (b)(2)(vii) (the Transfer Date), is no longer accurate with respect to a subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer for reasons other than as permitted by § 1005.32, the provider must provide, within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of the next preauthorized remittance transfer, a receipt that complies with § 1005.31(b)(2) and which discloses, among the other disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(2), the changed terms.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For example, if the provider discloses in the pre-payment disclosure for the first in the series of preauthorized remittance transfers that its fee for each remittance transfer is $20 and, after six preauthorized remittance transfers, the provider increases its fee to $30 (to the extent permitted by contract law), the provider must provide the sender a receipt that complies with §§ 1005.31(b)(2) and 1005.36(b)(2) within a reasonable time prior to the seventh transfer. Barring a further change, this receipt will apply to transfers after the seventh transfer. Or, if, after the sixth transfer, a tax increases from 1.5% of the amount that will be transferred to the designated recipient to 2.0% of the amount that will be transferred to the designated recipient, the provider must provide the sender a receipt that complies with §§ 1005.31(b)(2) and 1005.36(b)(2) within a reasonable time prior to the seventh transfer. In contrast, § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) does not require an updated receipt where an exchange rate, estimated as permitted in § 1005.32, changes.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 36(a)(2)-2 explains that in order to clearly and conspicuously indicate that the provider's fee has changed as required by § 1005.36(a)(2)(i), the provider could, for example, state on the receipt: “Transfer Fees (UPDATED) * * * $30.” To the extent that other figures on the receipt must be revised because of the new fee, the receipt should similarly indicate that those figures are updated.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In the February Proposal, the Bureau also solicited comment on whether it should provide a safe harbor interpreting the “within a reasonable time” standard for providing a pre-payment disclosure for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. Although such a disclosure is no longer required, the same “within a reasonable time” requirement now applies to receipts required by § 1005.36(a)(2)(i). The bulk of the comments received on how to interpret “within a reasonable time” concerned industry commenters' concerns regarding the requirement in the February Final Rule that any required pre-payment disclosures reflect the actual exchange rates that will apply to preauthorized remittance transfers. Industry commenters stated that it would be difficult to disclose accurate exchange rates ten days before the date of a remittance transfer. Insofar as § 1005.32(b)(2) allows estimates in disclosures provided for remittance transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer, this concern should be alleviated. Industry commenters generally stated that if estimates were permitted, ten days was a reasonable period of time.
          </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 36(a)(2)-3 explains if a receipt required by § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) (or, as discussed below, required by § 1005.36(d)(1)) is mailed, the receipt would be considered to be received by the sender five business days after it is posted in the mail. If hand delivered or provided electronically, the receipt would be considered to be received by the sender at the time of delivery. Thus, if the provider mails the receipt not later than ten business days before the scheduled date of the transfer, or hand or electronically delivers the receipt not later than five business days before the scheduled date of the transfer, the provider would be deemed to have mailed or delivered the receipt within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of the subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau is modifying § 1005.36(a)(2)(ii) from the February Final Rule, which requires receipts for all subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers. As adopted, § 1005.36(a)(2)(ii) explains when receipts must be sent. It states that unless a receipt was provided in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) that contained no estimates pursuant to § 1005.32, the remittance transfer provider must mail or deliver to the sender a receipt described in § 1005.31(b)(2) no later than one business day after the date of the transfer. If the remittance transfer involves the transfer of funds from the sender's account held by the provider, the receipt required by this paragraph may be provided on or with the next periodic statement for that account, or within 30 days after the date of the transfer if a periodic statement is not provided.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau is adopting an additional disclosure requirement for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers as § 1005.36(a)(2)(iii), which requires providers to provide the disclosures required by § 1005.36(d) in accordance with the timing requirements of that section. Section 1005.36(d) is discussed in more detail below.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>19(a)(8) Prepaid Account</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1005.19(a)(7) to provide that for purposes of proposed § 1005.19, “prepaid account” means a prepaid account as defined in proposed § 1005.2(b)(3). Proposed comment 19(a)(7)-1 would have explained that for purposes of proposed § 1005.19, a prepaid account includes, among other things, a payroll card account as defined in proposed § 1005.2(b)(3)(iii) and a government benefit account as defined proposed §§ 1005.2(b)(3)(iv) and 1005.15(a)(2).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received comments from several industry commenters, including issuing banks, industry trade associations, program managers, a think tank, and a law firm writing on behalf of a coalition of prepaid issuers, in response to the Bureau's request for comment regarding whether there were any types of prepaid accounts as defined in proposed § 1005.2(b)(3) that should be excluded from the definition of prepaid account for purposes of § 1005.19, or that should be excluded from certain requirements in § 1005.19. These commenters urged the Bureau to exclude prepaid account agreements that are not offered to the public (such as for payroll card, government benefit, and campus card accounts) from the requirement in proposed § 1005.19(b) to submit agreements to the Bureau for posting on the Bureau's publicly available Web site and the requirement in proposed § 1005.19(c) to post agreements on the issuer's publicly available Web site. These commenters explained that for these types of accounts, an issuer could have thousands of agreements that have been negotiated between the issuer and a third party (such as an employer, a government agency, or a university) and that are often tailored to fit the needs of individual programs. These commenters stated that such volume and variety would clutter the Bureau's and issuer's Web sites, overwhelm consumers, and cause confusion because consumers might not understand which agreement applies to their account or why the terms differ. These commenters stated that even if consumers could navigate the volume of agreements, the third party—not the consumers—chooses these agreements, so comparison shopping would not be an option. In addition, these commenters stated that the public posting of these agreements raises confidentiality concerns regarding the disclosure of proprietary account features, which would compromise the issuer's ability to negotiate customized account agreements. The commenters also argued that a public posting requirement would undermine competition because it would inhibit the incentive for companies to develop novel products.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Several consumer groups and the office of a State Attorney General urged the Bureau not to exclude any prepaid account agreements from the requirement to submit agreements to the Bureau for posting on the Bureau's publicly available Web site and the requirement to post agreements on the issuer's publicly available Web site. These commenters argued that publicly posting these agreements would encourage competition and transparency, which they stated would help lower fees, and facilitate comparison shopping, which they stated would result in more informed consumer decisions. One consumer group argued that the public posting of agreements would assist the Bureau, researchers, and consumer advocates in compiling information to issue reports and shed light on inappropriate practices by market participants. This commenter explained that the payroll card market, in particular, is secretive and issuers and employers in this market do not generally provide fee schedules when asked. This commenter added that when it began issuing reports on unemployment compensation cards, fees started to come down. This commenter also argued that employers, government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and other entities considering a prepaid card program would be able to see and compare the various terms offered in the market. This commenter further argued that, while payroll card issuers may have confidentiality clauses in their contracts with employers, those clauses do not bind employees because once a card is issued to an employee, the agreement is no longer confidential. Finally, the office of a State Attorney General argued that even though consumers who enroll in payroll card programs are not typically able to comparison shop because the employer selects their program, they would still be able to compare their plan with other wage payment options, such as a checking account, direct deposit, and other prepaid accounts.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth herein, the Bureau is finalizing § 1005.19(a)(7), renumbered as § 1005.19(a)(8), as proposed. The Bureau is also finalizing comment 19(a)(7)-1, renumbered as comment 19(a)(8)-1, with minor revisions for clarity and an updated internal paragraph citation to reflect numbering changes made in this final rule.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that the submission of all prepaid account agreements, including payroll card, government benefit, campus card, and other account agreements that are not available to the general public, is essential for the Bureau's market monitoring efforts. Furthermore, the Bureau's posting of these agreements to its Web site in the future will increase transparency in the terms of these agreements and the types and amounts of the fees imposed in these programs. The increased transparency will allow the public, including consumers, to become better informed about these accounts, which will likely encourage competition and improve fees in the various markets. In addition, the public posting to the Bureau's Web site in the future will allow entities such as employers, government agencies, and universities considering making prepaid account programs available to their constituencies to review similar agreements with other institutions and compare the various terms before entering into their own agreements. The Bureau also agrees that consumers of accounts with agreements that are not available to the general public, such as payroll card accounts, will be able to make meaningful comparisons with other wage payment options, such as a checking account, direct deposit, and other prepaid accounts. For these reasons, the Bureau declines to exclude payroll card, government benefit, campus card, and other account agreements that are not available to the general public from the final rule's submission requirement, as requested by some commenters.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is persuaded, however, that posting agreements that are not offered to the general public to the issuer's publicly available Web site may impose unnecessary administrative burden and have little consumer benefit. The Bureau has thus modified § 1005.19(c), discussed below, to exempt agreements that are not offered to the general public from the posting requirement. The final rule does not require issuers to post on the issuer's publicly available Web site agreements that are not offered to the general public, such as payroll card, government benefit, and campus card agreements. However, issuers of these agreements are still required to provide consumers with access to their specific agreements, as required by final § 1005.19(d). See the section-by-section analysis of § 1005.19(c) below for additional information regarding the posting requirement.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Private Label Credit Cards</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Board defined the term “private label credit card account” in what is now Regulation Z § 1026.58(b)(8)(i) as a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan with a credit card that can be used to make purchases only at a single merchant or an affiliated group of merchants. The term “private label credit card plan” in Regulation Z § 1026.58(b)(8)(ii) is similarly defined as all of the private label credit card accounts issued by a particular issuer with credit cards usable at the same single merchant or affiliated group of merchants. Regulation Z contains an exception and other specific provisions tailored specifically to private label credit card accounts and plans.<footnote ref="533">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; Regulation Z § 1026.58(b)(8), (c)(6); comments 58(b)(8)-1 through -4; comments 58(c)(6)-1 through -6; and comment 58(d)-3.</footnote>
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not believe that equivalent provisions were necessary or appropriate for proposed § 1005.19, as the equivalent of a private label credit card in the prepaid context would be a closed-loop gift card. Such gift cards were outside the scope of the term prepaid account, as defined in proposed §§ 1005.2(b)(3) and 1005.19(a)(7). The Bureau did not receive any comments on this issue.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1005.19(a)(7) to provide that for purposes of proposed § 1005.19, “prepaid account” means a prepaid account as defined in proposed § 1005.2(b)(3). Proposed comment 19(a)(7)-1 would have explained that for purposes of proposed § 1005.19, a prepaid account includes, among other things, a payroll card account as defined in proposed § 1005.2(b)(3)(iii) and a government benefit account as defined proposed §§ 1005.2(b)(3)(iv) and 1005.15(a)(2).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received comments from several industry commenters, including issuing banks, industry trade associations, program managers, a think tank, and a law firm writing on behalf of a coalition of prepaid issuers, in response to the Bureau's request for comment regarding whether there were any types of prepaid accounts as defined in proposed § 1005.2(b)(3) that should be excluded from the definition of prepaid account for purposes of § 1005.19, or that should be excluded from certain requirements in § 1005.19. These commenters urged the Bureau to exclude prepaid account agreements that are not offered to the public (such as for payroll card, government benefit, and campus card accounts) from the requirement in proposed § 1005.19(b) to submit agreements to the Bureau for posting on the Bureau's publicly available Web site and the requirement in proposed § 1005.19(c) to post agreements on the issuer's publicly available Web site. These commenters explained that for these types of accounts, an issuer could have thousands of agreements that have been negotiated between the issuer and a third party (such as an employer, a government agency, or a university) and that are often tailored to fit the needs of individual programs. These commenters stated that such volume and variety would clutter the Bureau's and issuer's Web sites, overwhelm consumers, and cause confusion because consumers might not understand which agreement applies to their account or why the terms differ. These commenters stated that even if consumers could navigate the volume of agreements, the third party—not the consumers—chooses these agreements, so comparison shopping would not be an option. In addition, these commenters stated that the public posting of these agreements raises confidentiality concerns regarding the disclosure of proprietary account features, which would compromise the issuer's ability to negotiate customized account agreements. The commenters also argued that a public posting requirement would undermine competition because it would inhibit the incentive for companies to develop novel products.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(a) set forth the requirements for the general form of disclosures required under proposed subpart B. Pursuant to EFTA sections 919(a)(3)(A) and (a)(5)(C),<footnote ref="74">EFTA section 919(a)(5)(C) incorporates the requirements of EFTA section 919(a)(3)(A) by reference, including the clear and conspicuous requirement.</footnote>
             proposed § 205.31(a)(1) provided that the disclosures required by subpart B must be clear and conspicuous. Proposed comment 31(a)(1)-1 clarified that disclosures are clear and conspicuous for purposes of subpart B if they are readily understandable and, in the case of written and electronic disclosures, the location and type size are readily noticeable to senders. The proposed comment stated that oral disclosures, to the extent permitted, are clear and conspicuous when they are given at a volume and speed sufficient for a sender to hear and comprehend them.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One industry trade association commenter supported the proposal, but suggested that the Bureau should also establish a reasonable person standard in determining whether a disclosure is clear and conspicuous. The Bureau believes the proposed comment, as well as the font and other formatting requirements provided in § 1005.31(c), below, provide remittance transfer providers with the guidance necessary to determine if disclosures are clear and conspicuous. Therefore, the clear and conspicuous standard is adopted as proposed in § 1005.31. Proposed comment 31(a)(1)-1 is also adopted substantially as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 205.31(a)(1) also provided that disclosures required by subpart B may contain commonly accepted or readily understandable abbreviations or symbols. Proposed comment 31(a)(1)-2 clarified that using abbreviations or symbols such as “USD” to indicate currency in U.S. dollars or “MXN” to indicate currency in Mexican pesos would be permissible. The Bureau did not receive comment regarding the use of commonly accepted or readily understandable abbreviations or symbols. Therefore, this aspect of proposed § 205.31(a)(1) is adopted as proposed in renumbered § 1005.31(a)(1). Comment 31(a)(1)-2 is also adopted as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>In the 2013 Final Rule, § 1005.31(a)(1) provides that disclosures required by subpart B of Regulation E must be clear and conspicuous.  It also states that disclosures required by this subpart may contain commonly accepted or readily understandable abbreviations or symbols. </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As is explained in detail below, as part of the changes adopted in the 2013 Final Rule, the Bureau is adding two optional disclosures.  First, the Bureau is making optional the requirement to disclose non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(b)(1)(viii).  Second, the Bureau is creating an exception to the definition of error for certain mistakes made by senders. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D).  If a provider wants to take advantage of this exception, it must provide a notice before the sender authorizes the remittance transfer consistent with § 1005.33(h)(3).  While these two disclosures are optional, the Bureau believes it is important to ensure that they are made in a manner that is clear and conspicuous.  Thus, the Bureau is amending § 1005.31(a)(1) to state that disclosures required by subpart B of Regulation E or permitted by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) or § 1005.33(h)(3) must be clear and conspicuous.  Disclosures required by subpart B of Regulation E or permitted by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) or § 1005.33(h)(3) may contain commonly accepted or readily understandable abbreviations or symbols. </analysisParagraph>
