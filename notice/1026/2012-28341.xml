              <title type="keyterm">Purpose.</title>
              <content>The purpose of this part is to promote the informed use of <ref target="1026-2-a-12" reftype="term">consumer credit</ref> by requiring disclosures about its terms and cost. The regulation also includes substantive protections. It gives <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumers</ref> the right to cancel certain <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> transactions that involve a lien on a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s principal <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>, regulates certain <ref target="1026-2-a-15-i" reftype="term">credit card</ref> practices, and provides a means for fair and timely resolution of <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> billing disputes. The regulation does not generally govern charges for <ref target="1026-2-a-12" reftype="term">consumer credit</ref>, except that several provisions in Subpart G set forth special rules addressing certain charges applicable to <ref target="1026-2-a-15-i" reftype="term">credit card</ref> accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) <ref target="1026-2-a-12" reftype="term">consumer credit</ref> plan. The regulation requires a maximum interest rate to be stated in variable-rate contracts secured by the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>. It also imposes limitations on home-equity plans that are subject to the requirements of § <ref target="1026-40" reftype="internal">1026.40</ref> and mortgages that are subject to the requirements of § <ref target="1026-32" reftype="internal">1026.32</ref>. The regulation prohibits certain <ref target="1026-2-a-1" reftype="term">acts</ref> or practices in connection with <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> secured by a <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> in § <ref target="1026-36" reftype="internal">1026.36</ref>, and <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> secured by a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s principal <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> in § <ref target="1026-35" reftype="internal">1026.35</ref>.

              <content>When calculating the minimum payment repayment estimate, <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuers</ref> must use the minimum payment formula(s) that apply to a <ref target="1026-2-a-8" reftype="term">cardholder</ref>'s account. If more than one minimum payment formula applies to an account, the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> must apply each minimum payment formula to the portion of the balance to which the formula applies. In this case, the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> must disclose the longest repayment period calculated. For example, assume that an <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> uses one minimum payment formula to calculate the minimum payment amount for a general revolving feature, and another minimum payment formula to calculate the minimum payment amount for special purchases, such as a “club plan purchase.” Also, assume that based on a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s balances in these features and the annual percentage rates that apply to such features, the repayment period calculated pursuant to this Appendix for the general revolving feature is 5 years, while the repayment period calculated for the special purchase feature is 3 years. This <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> must disclose 5 years as the repayment period for the entire balance to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>. If any <ref target="1026-M1-a-1" reftype="term">promotional terms</ref> related to payments apply to a <ref target="1026-2-a-8" reftype="term">cardholder</ref>'s account, such as a deferred billing plan where minimum payments are not required for 12 months, <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuers</ref> may assume no <ref target="1026-M1-a-1" reftype="term">promotional terms</ref> apply to the account. For example, assume that a promotional minimum payment of $10 applies to an account for six months, and then after the <ref target="1026-16-g-2-iii" reftype="term">promotional period</ref> expires, the minimum payment is calculated as 2 percent of the outstanding balance on the account or $20 whichever is greater. An <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> may assume during the <ref target="1026-16-g-2-iii" reftype="term">promotional period</ref> that the $10 promotional minimum payment does not apply, and instead calculate the minimum payment disclosures based on the minimum payment formula of 2 percent of the outstanding balance or $20, whichever is greater. Alternatively, during the <ref target="1026-16-g-2-iii" reftype="term">promotional period</ref>, an <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> in calculating the minimum payment repayment estimate may apply the promotional minimum payment until it expires and then apply the minimum payment formula that applies after the promotional minimum payment expires. In the above example, an <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> could calculate the minimum payment repayment estimate during the <ref target="1026-16-g-2-iii" reftype="term">promotional period</ref> by applying the $10 promotional minimum payment for the first six months and then applying the 2 percent or $20 (whichever is greater) minimum payment formula after the promotional minimum payment expires. In calculating the minimum payment repayment estimate during a <ref target="1026-16-g-2-iii" reftype="term">promotional period</ref>, an <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> may not assume that the promotional minimum payment will apply until the outstanding balance is paid off by making only minimum payments (assuming the repayment estimate is longer than the <ref target="1026-16-g-2-iii" reftype="term">promotional period</ref>). In the above example, the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> may not calculate the minimum payment repayment estimate during the <ref target="1026-16-g-2-iii" reftype="term">promotional period</ref> by assuming that the $10 promotional minimum payment will apply beyond the six months until the outstanding balance is repaid.</content></paragraph>

If the rate that applies after the <ref target="1026-16-g-2-i" reftype="term">promotional rate</ref>(s) expires is a variable rate, a <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuer</ref> must calculate that rate based on the applicable index or formula.

This means, in calculating the minimum payment repayment estimate, the <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuer</ref> must apply a zero percent annual percentage rate to the balance subject to the <ref target="1026-M1-a-2" reftype="term">deferred interest or similar plan</ref>. If, however, minimum payments under the deferred interes plan or similar plan may not repay the balances or transactions in full prior to the expiration of the specified period of time, a <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuer</ref> must assume that a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> will not repay the balances or transactions in full prior to the expiration of the specified period of time and thus the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> will be obligated to pay the accrued interest.

              <content>A minimum payment repayment estimate shall be considered accurate if it is not more than 2 months above or below the minimum payment repayment estimate determined in accordance with the guidance in this Appendix (prior to rounding described in § <ref target="1026-7-b-12-i-B" reftype="internal">1026.7(b)(12)(i)(B)</ref> and without use of the assumptions listed in paragraph <ref target="1026-M1-b-4" reftype="internal">(b)(4)</ref> of this Appendix to the extent a <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuer</ref> chooses instead to use the account terms that apply to a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s account). For example, assume the minimum payment repayment estimate calculated using the guidance in this Appendix is 28 months (2 years, 4 months), and the minimum payment repayment estimate calculated by the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> is 30 months (2 years, 6 months). The minimum payment repayment estimate should be disclosed as 2 years, due to the rounding rule set forth in § <ref target="1026-7-b-12-i-B" reftype="internal">1026.7(b)(12)(i)(B)</ref>. Nonetheless, based on the 30-month estimate, the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> disclosed 3 years, based on that rounding rule. The <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> would be in compliance with this guidance by disclosing 3 years, instead of 2 years, because the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref>'s estimate is within the 2 months' tolerance, prior to rounding. In addition, even if an <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref>'s estimate is more than 2 months above or below the minimum payment repayment estimate calculated using the guidance in this Appendix, so long as the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> discloses the correct number of years to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> based on the rounding rule set forth in § <ref target="1026-7-b-12-i-B" reftype="internal">1026.7(b)(12)(i)(B)</ref>, the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> would be in compliance with this guidance. For example, assume the minimum payment repayment estimate calculated using the guidance in this Appendix is 32 months (2 years, 8 months), and the minimum payment repayment estimate calculated by the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> is 38 months (3 years, 2 months). Under the rounding rule set forth in § <ref target="1026-7-b-12-i-B" reftype="internal">1026.7(b)(12)(i)(B)</ref>, both of these estimates would be rounded and disclosed to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> as 3 years. Thus, if the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> disclosed 3 years to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>, the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> would be in compliance with this guidance even though the minimum payment repayment estimate calculated by the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> is outside the 2 months' tolerance amount.</content>

                <content>Debt cancellation coverage provides for payment or satisfaction of all or part of a debt when a specified event occurs. The term “debt cancellation coverage” includes guaranteed automobile protection, or “GAP,” <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreements</ref>, which pay or satisfy the remaining debt after property insurance benefits are exhausted. Debt suspension coverage provides for suspension of the obligation to make one or more payments on the date(s) otherwise required by the <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreement</ref>, when a specified event occurs.

                <content>Some <ref target="1026-2-a-26" reftype="term">state</ref> or other laws require that a certain number of days must elapse following a due date before a late payment fee may be imposed. In addition, a <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuer</ref> may be restricted by the terms of the account <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreement</ref> from imposing a late payment fee until a payment is late for a certain number of days following a due date. For example, assume a payment is due on March 10 and the account <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreement</ref> or <ref target="1026-2-a-26" reftype="term">state</ref> law provides that a late payment fee cannot be assessed before March 21. A <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuer</ref> must disclose the due date under the terms of the legal obligation (March 10 in this example), and not a date different than the due date, such as when the <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuer</ref> is restricted by the account <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreement</ref> or <ref target="1026-2-a-26" reftype="term">state</ref> or other law from imposing a late payment fee unless a payment is late for a certain number of days following the due date (March 21 in this example). <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">Consumers</ref>' rights under <ref target="1026-2-a-26" reftype="term">state</ref> law to avoid the imposition of late payment fees during a specified period following a due date are unaffected by the disclosure requirement.

                <content>Tax refund loans, also known as refund anticipation loans (RALs), are transactions in which a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> will lend up to the amount of a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s expected tax refund. RAL <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreements</ref> typically require repayment upon demand, but also may provide that repayment is required when the refund is made. The <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreements</ref> also typically provide that if the amount of the refund is less than the payment due, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> must pay the difference. Repayment often is made by a preauthorized offset to a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s account held with the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> when the refund has been deposited by electronic transfer. <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">Creditors</ref> may charge fees for RALs in addition to fees for filing the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s tax return electronically.

(Thus the principal loan amount may, but need not, be determined to equal the face amount of the note.)

              <title type="keyterm">Policy statement.</title>
              <content>In many mortgages, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> cannot determine, at the time disclosure must be made, whether a loan may be assumable at a future date on its original terms. For example, the assumption clause commonly used in mortgages sold to the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation conditions an assumption on a variety of factors such as the creditworthiness of the subsequent borrower, the potential for impairment of the lender's security, and execution of an assumption <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreement</ref> by the subsequent borrower. In cases where uncertainty exists as to the future assumability of a mortgage, the disclosure under § <ref target="1026-18-q" reftype="internal">1026.18(q)</ref> should reflect that fact. In making disclosures in such cases, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may use phrases such as “subject to conditions,” “under certain circumstances,” or “depending on future conditions.” The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may provide a brief reference to more specific criteria such as a due-on-sale clause, although a complete explanation of all conditions is not appropriate. For example, the disclosure may state, “Someone buying your home may be allowed to assume the mortgage on its original terms, subject to certain conditions, such as payment of an assumption fee.” See comment <ref target="1026-17-a-1-Interp-5" reftype="internal">17(a)(1)-5</ref> for an example for a reference to a due-on-sale clause.</content>

When such estimated escrow payments must be disclosed in multiple columns of the table, such as for adjustable- and step-rate transactions, each column should use the same estimate for taxes and insurance except that the estimate should reflect changes in periodic mortgage insurance premiums that are known to the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> at the time the disclosure is made.

A disclosure is not required simply because a loan calls for non-amortizing or partially amortizing payments.

A disclosure is required, however, if the payment disclosed under § <ref target="1026-20-c-4" reftype="internal">1026.20(c)(4)</ref> is not sufficient to prevent <ref target="1026-18-s-7-v" reftype="term">negative amortization</ref> in the loan.

              <title type="keyterm">New advances.</title>
              <content>The exemption in § <ref target="1026-23-f-2" reftype="internal">1026.23(f)(2)</ref> applies only to refinancings (including consolidations) by the original <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>. The original <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> to whom the written <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreement</ref> was initially made payable. In a merger, consolidation or acquisition, the successor institution is considered the original <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> for purposes of the exemption in § <ref target="1026-23-f-2" reftype="internal">1026.23(f)(2)</ref>. If the refinancing involves a new advance of money, the amount of the new advance is rescindable. In determining whether there is a new advance, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may rely on the amount financed, refinancing costs, and other figures stated in the latest Truth in Lending disclosures provided to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> and is not required to use, for example, more precise information that may only become available when the loan is closed. For purposes of the right of rescission, a new advance does not include amounts attributed solely to the costs of the refinancing. These amounts would include § <ref target="1026-4-c-7" reftype="internal">1026.4(c)(7)</ref> charges (such as attorneys fees and title examination and insurance fees, if bona fide and reasonable in amount), as well as insurance premiums and other charges that are not finance charges. (Finance charges on the new transaction—points, for example—would not be considered in determining whether there is a new advance of money in a refinancing since finance charges are not part of the amount financed.) To illustrate, if the sum of the outstanding principal balance plus the earned unpaid finance charge is $50,000 and the new amount financed is $51,000, then the refinancing would be exempt if the extra $1,000 is attributed solely to costs financed in connection with the refinancing that are not finance charges. Of course, if new advances of money are made (for example, to pay for home improvements) and the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> exercises the right of rescission, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> must be placed in the same position as he or she was in prior to entering into the new <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> transaction. Thus, all amounts of money (which would include all the costs of the refinancing) already paid by the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> or to a third party as part of the refinancing would have to be refunded to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>. (See the commentary to § <ref target="1026-23-d-2-Interp" reftype="internal">1026.23(d)(2)</ref> for a discussion of refunds to <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumers</ref>.) A model rescission notice applicable to transactions involving new advances appears in Appendix <ref target="1026-H" reftype="internal">H</ref>. The general rescission notice (model form <ref target="1026-H-8" reftype="internal">H-8</ref>) is the appropriate form for use by <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> not considered original <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> in refinancing transactions.</content>

            <content>Generally, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may not increase the maximum interest rate originally set on a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> obligation subject to this section unless the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> and the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> enter into a new obligation. Therefore, under an open-end plan, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may not increase the rate ceiling imposed merely because there is an increase in the <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> limit. If an open-end plan is closed and another opened, a new rate ceiling may be imposed. Furthermore, where an open-end plan has a fixed maturity and a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> renews the plan at maturity, or enters into a <ref target="1026-2-a-10" reftype="term">closed-end credit</ref> transaction, a new maximum interest rate may be set at that time. If the open-end plan provides for a repayment phase, the maximum interest rate cannot be increased when the repayment phase begins unless the <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreement</ref> provided for such an increase. For a <ref target="1026-2-a-10" reftype="term">closed-end credit</ref> transaction, a new maximum interest rate may be set only if the transaction is satisfied and replaced by a new obligation. (The exceptions in § <ref target="1026-20-a-1" reftype="internal">1026.20(a)(1)</ref>-<ref target="1026-20-a-5" reftype="internal">(5)</ref> which limit what transactions are considered refinancings for purposes of disclosure do not apply with respect to increasing a rate ceiling that has been imposed; if a transaction is satisfied and replaced, the rate ceiling may be increased.)</content>

                <content>Under § <ref target="1026-36-d-1" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)(1)</ref>, a <ref target="1026-36-a-1" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>'s compensation may not vary based on any of a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> transaction's terms or conditions. Thus, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> and originator may not agree to set the originator's compensation at a certain level and then subsequently lower it in selective cases (such as where the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> is able to obtain a lower rate from another <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>).

For example, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> agrees to lower the rate that was initially offered, the new <ref target="1026-58-b-5" reftype="term">offer</ref> may not be accompanied by a reduction in the <ref target="1026-36-a-1" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>'s compensation.</content>

                <content>A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may provide a single disclosure form for all of its home equity plans, as long as the disclosure describes all aspects of the plans. For example, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> <ref target="1026-58-b-5" reftype="term">offers</ref> several payment options, all such options must be disclosed. (See, however, the commentary to <ref target="1026-40-d-5-iii-Interp" reftype="internal">§ 1026.40(d)(5)(iii)</ref> and <ref target="1026-40-d-12-x-Interp" reftype="internal">(d)(12) (x)</ref> and <ref target="1026-40-d-12-xi-Interp" reftype="internal">(xi)</ref> for disclosure requirements relating to these provisions.) If any aspects of a plan are linked together, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must disclose clearly the relationship of the terms to each other. For example, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> can only obtain a particular payment option in conjunction with a certain variable-rate feature, this fact must be disclosed. A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> has the option of providing separate disclosure forms for multiple options or variations in features. For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> that <ref target="1026-58-b-5" reftype="term">offers</ref> different payment options for the draw period may prepare separate disclosure forms for the two payment options. A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> using this alternative, however, must include a statement on each disclosure form that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> should ask about the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s other home equity programs. (This disclosure is required only for those programs available generally to the public. Thus, if the only other programs available are employee preferred-rate plans, for example, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> would not have to provide this statement.) A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> that receives a request for information about other available programs must provide the additional disclosures as soon as reasonably possible.</content>

Thus, for example, an <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreement</ref> may not provide that the balance is payable on demand nor may it provide that the account will be terminated and the balance accelerated if the rate cap is reached.</content>

                <content>In general, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may not change the terms of a plan after it is opened. For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may not increase any fee or impose a new fee once the plan has been opened, even if the fee is charged by a third party, such as a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> reporting agency, for a service. The change of terms prohibition applies to all features of a plan, not only those required to be disclosed under this section.

                  <content>A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may not include a general provision in its <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreement</ref> permitting changes to any or all of the terms of the plan.

In addition, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may not include any “triggering events” or responses that the regulation expressly addresses in a manner different from that provided in the regulation.

If, however, no range is used and the term is changed (for example, a rate cap of 6 rather than 5 percentage points over the initial rate), the change would permit the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to obtain a refund of fees. If a fee imposed by the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is stated in the early disclosures as an estimate and the fee changes, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> could elect to not enter into the <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreement</ref> and would be entitled to a refund of fees. On the other hand, if fees imposed by third parties are disclosed as estimates and those fees change, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> is not entitled to a refund of fees paid in connection with the application. <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">Creditors</ref> must, however, use the best information reasonably available in providing disclosures about such fees.</content>

It does not apply to all <ref target="1026-46-b-1" reftype="term">covered educational institutions</ref>. The requirement applies even if the student is not currently attending an <ref target="1026-46-b-2" reftype="term">institution of higher education</ref>, but will use the loan proceeds for <ref target="1026-46-b-3" reftype="term">postsecondary educational expenses</ref> while attending such institution. For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is required to obtain the form before consummating a <ref target="1026-46-b-5" reftype="term">private education loan</ref> provided to a high school senior for expenses to be incurred during the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s first year of college. This provision does not require that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> obtain the self-certification form in instances where the loan is not intended for a student attending an <ref target="1026-46-b-2" reftype="term">institution of higher education</ref>, such as when the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> is consolidating loans after graduation. Section 155(a)(2) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 provides that the form shall be made available to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> by the relevant <ref target="1026-46-b-2" reftype="term">institution of higher education</ref>. However, § <ref target="1026-48-e" reftype="internal">1026.48(e)</ref> provides flexibility to <ref target="1026-46-b-2" reftype="term">institutions of higher education</ref> and <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> as to how the completed self-certification form is provided to the lender. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may receive the form directly from the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>, or the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may receive the form from the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> through the <ref target="1026-46-b-2" reftype="term">institution of higher education</ref>. In addition, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may provide the form, and the information the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> will require to complete the form, directly to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>.</content>

                      <content>A required minimum periodic payment of $50 is due on July 25. On July 26, a late payment has occurred because no payment has been received. Accordingly, consistent with § <ref target="1026-52-b-1-ii-A" reftype="internal">1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A)</ref>, the <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuer</ref> imposes a $25 late payment fee on July 26.

On August 24, a $50 payment is received. On August 27, the $50 payment is returned to the <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuer</ref> for insufficient funds.

Accordingly, for purposes of § <ref target="1026-52-b-1-ii" reftype="internal">1026.52(b)(1)(ii)</ref>, the event or transaction constitutes a single violation. However, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuer</ref> imposes a late payment fee, § <ref target="1026-52-b-1-ii-B" reftype="internal">1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(B)</ref> permits the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> to impose a fee of $35 because the late payment occurred during the six <ref target="1026-2-a-4" reftype="term">billing cycles</ref> following the July <ref target="1026-2-a-4" reftype="term">billing cycle</ref>.

For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuer</ref> might obtain <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> reports for all of its applicants.

The description of the specific event or events that may result in an increased rate should be brief. For example, if an <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> may increase a rate to the penalty rate because the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> does not make the minimum payment by 5 p.m., Eastern Time, on its payment due date, the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> should describe this circumstance in the table as “make a late payment.” Similarly, if an <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> may increase a rate that applies to a particular balance because the account is more than 60 days late, the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> should describe this circumstance in the table as “make a late payment.” An <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> may not distinguish between the events that may result in an increased rate for existing balances and the events that may result in an increased rate for new transactions.

The description of how long the increased rate will remain in effect also should be brief. If a <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuer</ref> reserves the right to apply the increased rate to any balances indefinitely, to the extent permitted by §§ <ref target="1026-55-b-4" reftype="internal">1026.55(b)(4)</ref> and <ref target="1026-59" reftype="internal">1026.59</ref>, the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> should disclose that the penalty rate may apply indefinitely.

                <content>In some cases, one rate may be based on another rate on the account. For example, assume that a penalty rate as described in § <ref target="1026-60-b-1-iv-A" reftype="internal">1026.60(b)(1)(iv)(A)</ref> is determined by adding 5 percentage points to the current purchase rate, which is 10 percent.

If the purchase rate is a variable rate, then the penalty rate also is a variable rate. In that case, the <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuer</ref> also must disclose the fact that the penalty rate may vary and how the rate is determined, such as “This APR may vary with the market based on the Prime Rate.” In describing the penalty rate, the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> shall not disclose in the table the amount of the margin or spread added to the current purchase rate to determine the penalty rate, such as describing that the penalty rate is determined by adding 5 percentage points to the purchase rate.

            <content>The calculation of total annual loan cost rates under Appendix <ref target="1026-K" reftype="internal">K</ref> is based on the principles set forth and the estimation or “iteration” procedure used to compute annual percentage rates under Appendix <ref target="1026-J" reftype="internal">J</ref>. Rather than restate this iteration process in full, the regulation cross-references the procedures found in Appendix <ref target="1026-J" reftype="internal">J</ref>. In other aspects the appendix reflects the special nature of <ref target="1026-33-a" reftype="term">reverse mortgage transactions</ref>.
