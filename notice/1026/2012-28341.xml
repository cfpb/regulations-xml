    <title type="keyterm">Purpose.</title>
    <content>The purpose of this part is to promote the informed use of <ref target="1026-2-a-12" reftype="term">consumer credit</ref> by requiring disclosures about its terms and cost. The regulation also includes substantive protections. It gives <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumers</ref> the right to cancel certain credit transactions that involve a lien on a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s principal <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>, regulates certain <ref target="1026-2-a-15-i" reftype="term">credit card</ref> practices, and provides a means for fair and timely resolution of <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> billing disputes. The regulation does not generally govern charges for <ref target="1026-2-a-12" reftype="term">consumer credit</ref>, except that several provisions in Subpart G set forth special rules addressing certain charges applicable to <ref target="1026-2-a-15-i" reftype="term">credit card</ref> accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) <ref target="1026-2-a-12" reftype="term">consumer credit</ref> plan. The regulation requires a maximum interest rate to be stated in variable-rate contracts secured by the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>. It also imposes limitations on home-equity plans that are subject to the requirements of § <ref target="1026-40" reftype="internal">1026.40</ref> and mortgages that are subject to the requirements of § <ref target="1026-32" reftype="internal">1026.32</ref>. The regulation prohibits certain acts or practices in connection with <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> secured by a <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> in § <ref target="1026-36" reftype="internal">1026.36</ref>, and <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> secured by a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s principal <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> in § <ref target="1026-35" reftype="internal">1026.35</ref>. The regulation also regulates certain practices of <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> who extend <ref target="1026-46-b-5" reftype="term">private education loans</ref> as defined in § <ref target="1026-46-b-5" reftype="internal">1026.46(b)(5)</ref>.</content>

    <title type="keyterm">Minimum payment formulas.</title>
    <content>When calculating the minimum payment repayment estimate, <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuers</ref> must use the minimum payment formula(s) that apply to a <ref target="1026-2-a-8" reftype="term">cardholder</ref>'s account. If more than one minimum payment formula applies to an account, the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> must apply each minimum payment formula to the portion of the balance to which the formula applies. In this case, the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> must disclose the longest repayment period calculated. For example, assume that an <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> uses one minimum payment formula to calculate the minimum payment amount for a general revolving feature, and another minimum payment formula to calculate the minimum payment amount for special purchases, such as a “club plan purchase.” Also, assume that based on a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s balances in these features and the annual percentage rates that apply to such features, the repayment period calculated pursuant to this Appendix for the general revolving feature is 5 years, while the repayment period calculated for the special purchase feature is 3 years. This <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> must disclose 5 years as the repayment period for the entire balance to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>. If any <ref target="1026-M1-a-1" reftype="term">promotional terms</ref> related to payments apply to a <ref target="1026-2-a-8" reftype="term">cardholder</ref>'s account, such as a deferred billing plan where minimum payments are not required for 12 months, <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuers</ref> may assume no <ref target="1026-M1-a-1" reftype="term">promotional terms</ref> apply to the account. For example, assume that a promotional minimum payment of $10 applies to an account for six months, and then after the <ref target="1026-16-g-2-iii" reftype="term">promotional period</ref> expires, the minimum payment is calculated as 2 percent of the outstanding balance on the account or $20 whichever is greater. An <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> may assume during the <ref target="1026-16-g-2-iii" reftype="term">promotional period</ref> that the $10 promotional minimum payment does not apply, and instead calculate the minimum payment disclosures based on the minimum payment formula of 2 percent of the outstanding balance or $20, whichever is greater. Alternatively, during the <ref target="1026-16-g-2-iii" reftype="term">promotional period</ref>, an <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> in calculating the minimum payment repayment estimate may apply the promotional minimum payment until it expires and then apply the minimum payment formula that applies after the promotional minimum payment expires. In the above example, an <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> could calculate the minimum payment repayment estimate during the <ref target="1026-16-g-2-iii" reftype="term">promotional period</ref> by applying the $10 promotional minimum payment for the first six months and then applying the 2 percent or $20 (whichever is greater) minimum payment formula after the promotional minimum payment expires. In calculating the minimum payment repayment estimate during a <ref target="1026-16-g-2-iii" reftype="term">promotional period</ref>, an <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> may not assume that the promotional minimum payment will apply until the outstanding balance is paid off by making only minimum payments (assuming the repayment estimate is longer than the <ref target="1026-16-g-2-iii" reftype="term">promotional period</ref>). In the above example, the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> may not calculate the minimum payment repayment estimate during the <ref target="1026-16-g-2-iii" reftype="term">promotional period</ref> by assuming that the $10 promotional minimum payment will apply beyond the six months until the outstanding balance is repaid.</content></paragraph>

If the rate that applies after the <ref target="1026-16-g-2-i" reftype="term">promotional rate</ref>(s) expires is a variable rate, a <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuer</ref> must calculate that rate based on the applicable index or formula. This variable rate is accurate if it was in effect within the last 30 days before the minimum payment repayment estimate is provided.

This means, in calculating the minimum payment repayment estimate, the <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuer</ref> must apply a zero percent annual percentage rate to the balance subject to the <ref target="1026-M1-a-2" reftype="term">deferred interest or similar plan</ref>. If, however, minimum payments under the deferred interes plan or similar plan may not repay the balances or transactions in full prior to the expiration of the specified period of time, a <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuer</ref> must assume that a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> will not repay the balances or transactions in full prior to the expiration of the specified period of time and thus the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> will be obligated to pay the accrued interest. This means, in calculating the minimum payment repayment estimate, the <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuer</ref> must apply the annual percentage rate at which interest is accruing to the balance subject to the <ref target="1026-M1-a-2" reftype="term">deferred interest or similar plan</ref>.</content></paragraph>

    <content>A minimum payment repayment estimate shall be considered accurate if it is not more than 2 months above or below the minimum payment repayment estimate determined in accordance with the guidance in this Appendix (prior to rounding described in § <ref target="1026-7-b-12-i-B" reftype="internal">1026.7(b)(12)(i)(B)</ref> and without use of the assumptions listed in paragraph <ref target="1026-M1-b-4" reftype="internal">(b)(4)</ref> of this Appendix to the extent a <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuer</ref> chooses instead to use the account terms that apply to a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s account). For example, assume the minimum payment repayment estimate calculated using the guidance in this Appendix is 28 months (2 years, 4 months), and the minimum payment repayment estimate calculated by the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> is 30 months (2 years, 6 months). The minimum payment repayment estimate should be disclosed as 2 years, due to the rounding rule set forth in § <ref target="1026-7-b-12-i-B" reftype="internal">1026.7(b)(12)(i)(B)</ref>. Nonetheless, based on the 30-month estimate, the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> disclosed 3 years, based on that rounding rule. The <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> would be in compliance with this guidance by disclosing 3 years, instead of 2 years, because the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref>'s estimate is within the 2 months' tolerance, prior to rounding. In addition, even if an <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref>'s estimate is more than 2 months above or below the minimum payment repayment estimate calculated using the guidance in this Appendix, so long as the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> discloses the correct number of years to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> based on the rounding rule set forth in § <ref target="1026-7-b-12-i-B" reftype="internal">1026.7(b)(12)(i)(B)</ref>, the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> would be in compliance with this guidance. For example, assume the minimum payment repayment estimate calculated using the guidance in this Appendix is 32 months (2 years, 8 months), and the minimum payment repayment estimate calculated by the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> is 38 months (3 years, 2 months). Under the rounding rule set forth in § <ref target="1026-7-b-12-i-B" reftype="internal">1026.7(b)(12)(i)(B)</ref>, both of these estimates would be rounded and disclosed to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> as 3 years. Thus, if the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> disclosed 3 years to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>, the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> would be in compliance with this guidance even though the minimum payment repayment estimate calculated by the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> is outside the 2 months' tolerance amount.</content>

    <content>In calculating the estimated monthly payment for repayment in 36 months, an <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> may use a weighted annual percentage rate that is based on the annual percentage rates that apply to a <ref target="1026-2-a-8" reftype="term">cardholder</ref>'s account and the portion of the balance to which the rate applies, as shown in Appendix <ref target="1026-M2" reftype="internal">M2</ref> to this part.

    <content>Debt cancellation coverage provides for payment or satisfaction of all or part of a debt when a specified event occurs. The term “debt cancellation coverage” includes guaranteed automobile protection, or “GAP,” <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreements</ref>, which pay or satisfy the remaining debt after property insurance benefits are exhausted.

    <content>In disclosing whether or not a <ref target="1026-5-b-2-ii-B-3" reftype="term">grace period</ref> exists, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> need not use “free period,” “free-ride period,” “grace period” or any other particular descriptive phrase or term.

In the same fashion, a statement that “finance charges will be imposed on any new purchases only if they are not paid in full within 25 days after the close of the billing cycle” indicates that a <ref target="1026-5-b-2-ii-B-3" reftype="term">grace period</ref> exists in the interim.</content>

    <content>A fee to join a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> union is an example of a fee for a package of services that is not imposed as part of the plan, even if the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> must join the <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> union to apply for <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref>. In contrast, a membership fee is an example of a fee for a package of services that is considered to be imposed as part of a plan where the primary benefit of membership in the organization is the opportunity to apply for a <ref target="1026-2-a-15-i" reftype="term">credit card</ref>, and the other benefits offered (such as a newsletter or a member information hotline) are merely incidental to the credit feature.</content>

For example, if a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> adds a balance transfer feature to an account more than 30 days after account-opening disclosures are provided, it must give the finance charge disclosures for the balance transfer feature under § <ref target="1026-9-b" reftype="internal">1026.9(b)</ref> as well as comply with the change-in-terms notice requirements under § <ref target="1026-9-c" reftype="internal">1026.9(c)</ref>, including providing notice of the change at least 45 days prior to the effective date of the change.

    <content>The § <ref target="1026-12-c" reftype="internal">1026.12(c)</ref> <ref target="1026-2-a-15-i" reftype="term">credit card</ref> “holder in due course” provision deals with the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s right to assert against the <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuer</ref> a claim or defense concerning property or services purchased with a <ref target="1026-2-a-15-i" reftype="term">credit card</ref>, if the merchant has been unwilling to resolve the dispute. Even though certain merchandise disputes, such as non-delivery of goods, may also constitute “billing errors” under § <ref target="1026-13" reftype="internal">1026.13</ref>, that section operates independently of § <ref target="1026-12-c" reftype="internal">1026.12(c)</ref>. The <ref target="1026-2-a-8" reftype="term">cardholder</ref> whose asserted <ref target="1026-13-a" reftype="term">billing error</ref> involves undelivered goods may institute the error resolution procedures of § <ref target="1026-13" reftype="internal">1026.13</ref>; but whether or not the <ref target="1026-2-a-8" reftype="term">cardholder</ref> has done so, the <ref target="1026-2-a-8" reftype="term">cardholder</ref> may assert claims or defenses under § <ref target="1026-12-c" reftype="internal">1026.12(c)</ref>. Conversely, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> may pay a disputed balance and thus have no further right to assert claims and defenses, but still may assert a <ref target="1026-13-a" reftype="term">billing error</ref> if notice of that <ref target="1026-13-a" reftype="term">billing error</ref> is given in the proper time and manner. An assertion that a particular transaction resulted from <ref target="1026-12-b-1-i" reftype="term">unauthorized use</ref> of the card could also be both a “defense” and a <ref target="1026-13-a" reftype="term">billing error</ref>.</content></interpParagraph>

    <title type="keyterm">Special rules for tax refund anticipation loans.</title>
    <content>Tax refund loans, also known as refund anticipation loans (RALs), are transactions in which a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> will lend up to the amount of a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s expected tax refund. RAL <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreements</ref> typically require repayment upon demand, but also may provide that repayment is required when the refund is made. The <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreements</ref> also typically provide that if the amount of the refund is less than the payment due, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> must pay the difference. Repayment often is made by a preauthorized offset to a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s account held with the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> when the refund has been deposited by electronic transfer. <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">Creditors</ref> may charge fees for RALs in addition to fees for filing the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s tax return electronically. In RAL transactions subject to the regulation the following special rules apply:</content>
    <interpParagraph label="1026-17-c-1-Interp-17-i" marker="i.">
      <content>If, under the terms of the legal obligation, repayment of the loan is required when the refund is received by the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> (such as by deposit into the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s account), the disclosures should be based on the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s estimate of the time the refund will be delivered even if the loan also contains a demand clause. The practice of a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> to demand repayment upon delivery of refunds does not determine whether the legal obligation requires that repayment be made at that time; this determination must be made according to applicable state or other law.

(See the commentary to § <ref target="1026-17-a-1-Interp" reftype="internal">1026.17(a)(1)</ref> regarding directly related information.) If the effect cannot be determined, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must provide a statement of the possible effects. For example, if the exercise of the variable-rate feature may result in either more or larger payments, both possibilities must be noted.</content>

    <content>Many state laws authorize the calculation of late charges on the basis of either a percentage or a specified dollar amount, and permit imposition of the lesser or greater of the 2 charges. The disclosure made under § <ref target="1026-18-l" reftype="internal">1026.18(l)</ref> may reflect this alternative. For example, stating that the charge in the event of a late payment is 5% of the late amount, not to exceed $5.00, is sufficient. Many <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> also permit a <ref target="1026-5-b-2-ii-B-3" reftype="term">grace period</ref> during which no late charge will be assessed; this fact may be disclosed as directly related information.

    <content>In many mortgages, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> cannot determine, at the time disclosure must be made, whether a loan may be assumable at a future date on its original terms. For example, the assumption clause commonly used in mortgages sold to the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation conditions an assumption on a variety of factors such as the creditworthiness of the subsequent borrower, the potential for impairment of the lender's security, and execution of an assumption <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreement</ref> by the subsequent borrower. In cases where uncertainty exists as to the future assumability of a mortgage, the disclosure under § <ref target="1026-18-q" reftype="internal">1026.18(q)</ref> should reflect that fact. In making disclosures in such cases, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may use phrases such as “subject to conditions,” “under certain circumstances,” or “depending on future conditions.” The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may provide a brief reference to more specific criteria such as a due-on-sale clause, although a complete explanation of all conditions is not appropriate. For example, the disclosure may state, “Someone buying your home may be allowed to assume the mortgage on its original terms, subject to certain conditions, such as payment of an assumption fee.” See comment <ref target="1026-17-a-1-Interp-5" reftype="internal">17(a)(1)-5</ref> for an example for a reference to a due-on-sale clause.</content>

When such estimated escrow payments must be disclosed in multiple columns of the table, such as for adjustable- and step-rate transactions, each column should use the same estimate for taxes and insurance except that the estimate should reflect changes in periodic mortgage insurance premiums that are known to the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> at the time the disclosure is made. The estimated amounts of mortgage insurance premiums should be based on the declining principal balance that will occur as a result of changes to the interest rate that are assumed for purposes of disclosing those rates under § <ref target="1026-18-s-2" reftype="internal">1026.18(s)(2)</ref> and accompanying commentary. The payment amount must include estimated amounts for property taxes and premiums for mortgage-related insurance required by the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>, such as insurance against loss of or damage to property, or against liability arising out of the ownership or use of the property, or insurance protecting the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> against the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s default or other credit loss.

Thus, disclosures for ARMs offered with any term from over 1 year to 40 years may be based solely on terms of 5, 15 and 30 years.

    <content>This paragraph requires a disclosure only when <ref target="1026-18-s-7-v" reftype="term">negative amortization</ref> occurs as a result of the adjustment.

To illustrate, if the sum of the outstanding principal balance plus the earned unpaid finance charge is $50,000 and the new amount financed is $51,000, then the refinancing would be exempt if the extra $1,000 is attributed solely to costs financed in connection with the refinancing that are not finance charges. Of course, if new advances of money are made (for example, to pay for home improvements) and the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> exercises the right of rescission, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> must be placed in the same position as he or she was in prior to entering into the new credit transaction. Thus, all amounts of money (which would include all the costs of the refinancing) already paid by the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> or to a third party as part of the refinancing would have to be refunded to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>.

A model rescission notice applicable to transactions involving new advances appears in Appendix <ref target="1026-H" reftype="internal">H</ref>. The general rescission notice (model form <ref target="1026-H-8" reftype="internal">H-8</ref>) is the appropriate form for use by <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> not considered original <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> in refinancing transactions.</content>

With respect to the rules on correction of <ref target="1026-13-a" reftype="term">billing errors</ref> and regulation of <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> reports (which are in § <ref target="1026-13" reftype="internal">1026.13</ref>), § <ref target="1026-28-a-2-i" reftype="internal">1026.28(a)(2)(i)</ref> provides that a state law is inconsistent and preempted if its requirements are different from the Federal law. An exception is made, however, for state laws that allow the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to inquire about an account and require the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> to respond to such inquiries beyond the time limits in the Federal law. Such a state law is not preempted with respect to the extra time period. For example, § <ref target="1026-13" reftype="internal">1026.13</ref> requires the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to submit a written notice of <ref target="1026-13-a" reftype="term">billing error</ref> within 60 days after transmittal of the periodic statement showing the alleged error. If a state law allows the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> 90 days to submit a notice, the state law remains in effect to provide the extra 30 days. Any state law disclosures concerning this extended state time limit must reflect the qualifications and conform to the format specified in § <ref target="1026-28-a-2-i" reftype="internal">1026.28(a)(2)(i)</ref>. Examples of laws that would be preempted include:</content>

    <content>The standard that applies to preemption of state laws as they affect transactions of the type subject to §§ <ref target="1026-60" reftype="internal">1026.60</ref> and <ref target="1026-9-e" reftype="internal">1026.9(e)</ref> differs from the preemption standards generally applicable under the Truth in Lending Act. The Fair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act fully preempts state laws relating to the disclosure of <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> information in <ref target="1026-2-a-12" reftype="term">consumer credit</ref> or <ref target="1026-2-a-15-iii" reftype="term">charge card</ref> applications or <ref target="1026-46-d-1-i" reftype="term">solicitations</ref>. (For purposes of this section, a single <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> or <ref target="1026-2-a-15-iii" reftype="term">charge card</ref> application or <ref target="1026-46-d-1-i" reftype="term">solicitation</ref> that may be used to open either an account for <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> purposes or an account for business purposes is deemed to be a “<ref target="1026-2-a-12" reftype="term">consumer credit</ref> or <ref target="1026-2-a-15-iii" reftype="term">charge card</ref> application or <ref target="1026-46-d-1-i" reftype="term">solicitation</ref>.”) For example, a state law requiring disclosure of <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> terms in direct mail <ref target="1026-46-d-1-i" reftype="term">solicitations</ref> for <ref target="1026-2-a-12" reftype="term">consumer credit</ref> card accounts is preempted. A state law requiring disclosures in telephone applications for <ref target="1026-2-a-12" reftype="term">consumer credit</ref> card accounts also is preempted, even if it applies to applications initiated by the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> rather than the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref>, because the state law relates to the disclosure of <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> information in applications or <ref target="1026-46-d-1-i" reftype="term">solicitations</ref> within the general field of preemption, that is, <ref target="1026-2-a-12" reftype="term">consumer credit</ref> and <ref target="1026-2-a-15-iii" reftype="term">charge cards</ref>.</content>

    <title type="keyterm">Limitations on field of preemption.</title>
    <content>Preemption under the Fair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act does not extend to state laws applying to types of <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> other than open-end <ref target="1026-2-a-12" reftype="term">consumer credit</ref> and <ref target="1026-2-a-15-iii" reftype="term">charge card</ref> accounts. Thus, for example, a state law is not preempted as it applies to disclosures in <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> and <ref target="1026-2-a-15-iii" reftype="term">charge card</ref> applications and <ref target="1026-46-d-1-i" reftype="term">solicitations</ref> solely for business-purpose accounts. On the other hand, state <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> disclosure laws will not apply to a single application or <ref target="1026-46-d-1-i" reftype="term">solicitation</ref> to open either an account for <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> purposes or an account for business purposes. Such “dual purpose” applications and <ref target="1026-46-d-1-i" reftype="term">solicitations</ref> are treated as “consumer credit or charge card applications or solicitations” under this section and state <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> disclosure laws applicable to them are preempted. Preemption under this statute does not extend to state laws applicable to home equity plans; preemption determinations in this area are based on the Home Equity Loan <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">Consumer</ref> Protection Act, as implemented in § <ref target="1026-40" reftype="internal">1026.40</ref> of the regulation.</content>

    <content>Generally, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may not increase the maximum interest rate originally set on a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> obligation subject to this section unless the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> and the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> enter into a new obligation. Therefore, under an open-end plan, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may not increase the rate ceiling imposed merely because there is an increase in the credit limit. If an open-end plan is closed and another opened, a new rate ceiling may be imposed. Furthermore, where an open-end plan has a fixed maturity and a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> renews the plan at maturity, or enters into a closed-end credit transaction, a new maximum interest rate may be set at that time. If the open-end plan provides for a repayment phase, the maximum interest rate cannot be increased when the repayment phase begins unless the <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreement</ref> provided for such an increase. For a closed-end credit transaction, a new maximum interest rate may be set only if the transaction is satisfied and replaced by a new obligation. (The exceptions in § <ref target="1026-20-a-1" reftype="internal">1026.20(a)(1)</ref>-<ref target="1026-20-a-5" reftype="internal">(5)</ref> which limit what transactions are considered refinancings for purposes of disclosure do not apply with respect to increasing a rate ceiling that has been imposed; if a transaction is satisfied and replaced, the rate ceiling may be increased.)</content>

    <content>A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may provide a single disclosure form for all of its home equity plans, as long as the disclosure describes all aspects of the plans. For example, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> <ref target="1026-58-b-5" reftype="term">offers</ref> several payment options, all such options must be disclosed.

If any aspects of a plan are linked together, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must disclose clearly the relationship of the terms to each other. For example, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> can only obtain a particular payment option in conjunction with a certain variable-rate feature, this fact must be disclosed. A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> has the option of providing separate disclosure forms for multiple options or variations in features. For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> that <ref target="1026-58-b-5" reftype="term">offers</ref> different payment options for the draw period may prepare separate disclosure forms for the two payment options. A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> using this alternative, however, must include a statement on each disclosure form that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> should ask about the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s other home equity programs. (This disclosure is required only for those programs available generally to the public. Thus, if the only other programs available are employee preferred-rate plans, for example, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> would not have to provide this statement.) A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> that receives a request for information about other available programs must provide the additional disclosures as soon as reasonably possible.</content>

However, the use of a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s full name, even if that name includes the name of a <ref target="1026-46-b-1" reftype="term">covered educational institution</ref>, does not imply endorsement. For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> union whose name includes the name of a <ref target="1026-46-b-1" reftype="term">covered educational institution</ref> is not prohibited from using its own name. In addition, the authorized use of a state seal by a state or an <ref target="1026-46-b-2" reftype="term">institution of higher education</ref> in the marketing of state education loan products does not imply endorsement.</content>

    <title type="keyterm">Permissible changes to rates and terms—re-disclosure required.</title>
    <content>A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may make changes to the interest rate or terms to accommodate a request from a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>. For example, assume a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> applies for a $10,000 loan and is approved for the $10,000 amount at an interest rate of 6%. After the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> has provided the approval disclosures, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s financial need increases, and the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> requests to a loan amount of $15,000. In this situation, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is permitted to <ref target="1026-58-b-5" reftype="term">offer</ref> a $15,000 loan, and to make any other changes such as raising the interest rate to 7%, in response to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s request. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must provide a new set of disclosures under § <ref target="1026-47-b" reftype="internal">1026.47(b)</ref> and provide the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> with 30 days to accept the <ref target="1026-58-b-5" reftype="term">offer</ref> under § <ref target="1026-48-c" reftype="internal">1026.48(c)</ref> for the $15,000 loan offered in response to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s request. However, because the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> may choose not to accept the <ref target="1026-58-b-5" reftype="term">offer</ref> for the $15,000 loan at the higher interest rate, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may not withdraw or change the rate or terms of the <ref target="1026-58-b-5" reftype="term">offer</ref> for the $10,000 loan, except as permitted under § <ref target="1026-48-c-3" reftype="internal">1026.48(c)(3)</ref>, unless the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> accepts the $15,000 loan.</content>

    <content>Section <ref target="1026-48-e" reftype="internal">1026.48(e)</ref> requires that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> obtain the self-certification form, signed by the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>, before consummating the <ref target="1026-46-b-5" reftype="term">private education loan</ref>. The rule applies only to <ref target="1026-46-b-5" reftype="term">private education loans</ref> that will be used for the <ref target="1026-46-b-3" reftype="term">postsecondary educational expenses</ref> of a student while that student is attending an <ref target="1026-46-b-2" reftype="term">institution of higher education</ref> as defined in § <ref target="1026-46-b-2" reftype="internal">1026.46(b)(2)</ref>. It does not apply to all <ref target="1026-46-b-1" reftype="term">covered educational institutions</ref>. The requirement applies even if the student is not currently attending an <ref target="1026-46-b-2" reftype="term">institution of higher education</ref>, but will use the loan proceeds for <ref target="1026-46-b-3" reftype="term">postsecondary educational expenses</ref> while attending such institution. For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is required to obtain the form before consummating a <ref target="1026-46-b-5" reftype="term">private education loan</ref> provided to a high school senior for expenses to be incurred during the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s first year of college. This provision does not require that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> obtain the self-certification form in instances where the loan is not intended for a student attending an <ref target="1026-46-b-2" reftype="term">institution of higher education</ref>, such as when the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> is consolidating loans after graduation. Section 155(a)(2) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 provides that the form shall be made available to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> by the relevant <ref target="1026-46-b-2" reftype="term">institution of higher education</ref>. However, § <ref target="1026-48-e" reftype="internal">1026.48(e)</ref> provides flexibility to <ref target="1026-46-b-2" reftype="term">institutions of higher education</ref> and <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> as to how the completed self-certification form is provided to the lender. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may receive the form directly from the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>, or the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may receive the form from the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> through the <ref target="1026-46-b-2" reftype="term">institution of higher education</ref>. In addition, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may provide the form, and the information the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> will require to complete the form, directly to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>.</content>

    <content>A required minimum periodic payment of $50 is due on July 25. On July 26, a late payment has occurred because no payment has been received. Accordingly, consistent with § <ref target="1026-52-b-1-ii-A" reftype="internal">1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(A)</ref>, the <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuer</ref> imposes a $25 late payment fee on July 26.

The <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuer</ref> also discloses that, to the extent consistent with § <ref target="1026-55" reftype="internal">1026.55</ref> and other applicable law, a non-variable penalty rate of 30% may apply if the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s required minimum periodic payment is received after the payment due date, which is the first of the month. On June 30 of year two, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> uses the account for a $1,000 purchase in response to an <ref target="1026-58-b-5" reftype="term">offer</ref> of a <ref target="1026-16-h-2" reftype="term">deferred interest</ref> program.

Furthermore, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> pays the $1,000 purchase in full on or before December 31 of year three, § <ref target="1026-55" reftype="internal">1026.55</ref> does not permit the <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuer</ref> to charge to the account any interest that has accrued on that purchase.

    <title type="keyterm">Introductory rates—general.</title>
    <content>An <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> is required to disclose directly beneath the table the circumstances under which an introductory rate, as that term is defined in § <ref target="1026-16-g-2-ii" reftype="internal">1026.16(g)(2)(ii)</ref>, may be revoked, and the rate that will apply after the revocation. This information about revocation of an introductory rate and the rate that will apply after revocation must be provided even if the rate that will apply after the introductory rate is revoked is the rate that would have applied at the end of the <ref target="1026-16-g-2-iii" reftype="term">promotional period</ref>. In a variable-rate account, the rate that would have applied at the end of the <ref target="1026-16-g-2-iii" reftype="term">promotional period</ref> is a rate based on the applicable index or formula in accordance with the accuracy requirements set forth in § <ref target="1026-60-c-2" reftype="internal">1026.60(c)(2)</ref> or <ref target="1026-60-e-4" reftype="internal">(e)(4)</ref>. In describing the rate that will apply after revocation of the introductory rate, if the rate that will apply after revocation of the introductory rate is already disclosed in the table, the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> is not required to repeat the rate, but may refer to that rate in a clear and conspicuous manner. For example, if the rate that will apply after revocation of an introductory rate is the standard rate that applies to that <ref target="1026-36-e-2" reftype="term">type of transaction</ref> (such as a purchase or balance transfer transaction), and the standard rates are labeled in the table as “standard APRs,” the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> may refer to the “standard APR” when describing the rate that will apply after revocation of an introductory rate. (See Sample <ref target="1026-G-10(C)" reftype="internal">G-10(C)</ref> in the disclosure labeled “Loss of Introductory APR” directly beneath the table.) The description of the circumstances in which an introductory rate could be revoked should be brief. For example, if an <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> may increase an introductory rate because the account is more than 60 days late, the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> should describe this circumstance directly beneath the table as “make a late payment.” In addition, if the circumstances in which an introductory rate could be revoked are already listed elsewhere in the table, the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> is not required to repeat the circumstances again, but may refer to those circumstances in a clear and conspicuous manner. For example, if the circumstances in which an introductory rate could be revoked are the same as the event or events that may trigger a “penalty rate” as described in § <ref target="1026-60-b-1-iv-A" reftype="internal">1026.60(b)(1)(iv)(A)</ref>, the <ref target="1026-58-b-4" reftype="term">issuer</ref> may refer to the actions listed in the Penalty APR row, in describing the circumstances in which the introductory rate could be revoked.

    <content>In some cases, one rate may be based on another rate on the account. For example, assume that a penalty rate as described in § <ref target="1026-60-b-1-iv-A" reftype="internal">1026.60(b)(1)(iv)(A)</ref> is determined by adding 5 percentage points to the current purchase rate, which is 10 percent.

    <title type="keyterm">General.</title>
    <content>The calculation of total annual loan cost rates under Appendix <ref target="1026-K" reftype="internal">K</ref> is based on the principles set forth and the estimation or “iteration” procedure used to compute annual percentage rates under Appendix <ref target="1026-J" reftype="internal">J</ref>. Rather than restate this iteration process in full, the regulation cross-references the procedures found in Appendix <ref target="1026-J" reftype="internal">J</ref>. In other aspects the appendix reflects the special nature of <ref target="1026-33-a" reftype="term">reverse mortgage transactions</ref>. Special definitions and instructions are included where appropriate.</content>
