            <content>Guidance for determining a comparable transaction is set forth in comments 35(a)(1)-1 and 35(a)(2)-2 and -3, which direct <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> to published tables of <ref target="1026-35-a-2" reftype="term">average prime offer rates</ref> for fixed- and variable-rate <ref target="1026-2-a-10" reftype="term">closed-end credit</ref> transactions. <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">Creditors</ref> opening <ref target="1026-2-a-20" reftype="term">open-end credit</ref> plans must compare the annual percentage rate for the plan to the <ref target="1026-35-a-2" reftype="term">average prime offer rate</ref> for the most closely comparable closed-end transaction. To identify the most closely comparable closed-end transaction, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> should identify whether the <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> plan is fixed- or variable-rate; if the plan is fixed-rate, the term of the plan to maturity; if the plan is variable-rate, the duration of any initial, fixed-rate period; and the date the interest rate for the plan is set. If a fixed-rate plan has no definite plan length, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must use the <ref target="1026-35-a-2" reftype="term">average prime offer rate</ref> for a 30-year fixed-rate loan. If a variable-rate plan has an optional, fixed-rate feature, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must use the rate table for variable-rate transactions. If a variable-rate plan has an initial, fixed-rate period that is not in whole years, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must identify the most closely-comparable transaction by using the number of whole years closest to the actual fixed-rate period. For example, if a variable-rate plan has an initial fixed-rate period of 20 months, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must use the <ref target="1026-35-a-2" reftype="term">average prime offer rate</ref> for a two-year adjustable-rate loan. If a variable-rate plan has no initial fixed-rate period, or if it has an initial fixed-rate period of less than one year, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must use the <ref target="1026-35-a-2" reftype="term">average prime offer rate</ref> for a one-year adjustable-rate loan. Thus, for example, if the initial fixed-rate period is six months, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must use the <ref target="1026-35-a-2" reftype="term">average prime offer rate</ref> for a one-year adjustable-rate loan.</content></interpParagraph>

          <title>Construction-permanent loans.</title>
          <content>Section 1026.32 does not apply to a transaction to finance the initial construction of a <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>. This exemption applies to a construction-only loan as well as to the construction phase of a construction-to-permanent loan. Section 1026.32 may apply, however, to permanent financing that replaces a construction loan, whether the permanent financing is extended by the same or a different <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>. When a construction loan may be permanently financed by the same <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>, § <ref target="1026-17-c-6-ii" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)(6)(ii)</ref> permits the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> to give either one combined disclosure for both the construction financing and the permanent financing, or a separate set of disclosures for each of the two phases as though they were two separate transactions. See also comment 17(c)(6)-2. Section <ref target="1026-17-c-6-ii" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)(6)(ii)</ref> addresses only how a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may elect to disclose a construction to permanent transaction. Which disclosure option a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> elects under § <ref target="1026-17-c-6-ii" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)(6)(ii)</ref> does not affect the determination of whether the permanent phase of the transaction is subject to § <ref target="1026-32" reftype="internal">1026.32</ref>. When the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> discloses the two phases as separate transactions, the annual percentage rate for the permanent phase must be compared to the <ref target="1026-35-a-2" reftype="term">average prime offer rate</ref> for a transaction that is comparable to the permanent financing to determine coverage under § <ref target="1026-32" reftype="internal">1026.32</ref>. Likewise, a single amount of <ref target="1026-32-b-1" reftype="term">points and fees</ref>, also reflecting the appropriate charges from the permanent phase, must be calculated and compared with the total <ref target="1026-43-b-5" reftype="term">loan amount</ref> to determine coverage under § <ref target="1026-32" reftype="internal">1026.32</ref>. When the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> discloses the two phases as a single transaction, a single annual percentage rate, reflecting the appropriate charges from both phases, must be calculated for the transaction in accordance with § <ref target="1026-32-a-3" reftype="internal">1026.32(a)(3)</ref> and appendix D to part 1026. This annual percentage rate must be compared to the <ref target="1026-35-a-2" reftype="term">average prime offer rate</ref> for a transaction that is comparable to the permanent financing to determine coverage under § <ref target="1026-32" reftype="internal">1026.32</ref>.

The procedures for verifying repayment ability are required under § <ref target="1026-34-a-4-ii" reftype="internal">1026.34(a)(4)(ii)</ref>; the other procedures are not required but, if followed along with the required procedures, create a presumption that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> has complied with § <ref target="1026-34-a-4" reftype="internal">1026.34(a)(4)</ref>.

For example, evidence of a very high debt-to-income ratio and a very limited residual income could be sufficient to rebut the presumption, depending on all of the facts and circumstances.

For example, assume that a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s regular periodic payment of $500 is due on the 1st of each month. On August 25, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> makes a $500 payment which was due on August 1, and as a result, a $10 late charge is assessed. On September 1, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> makes another $500 payment for the regular periodic payment due on September 1, but does not pay the $10 late charge assessed on the August payment.

In short, because the $500 payment made on September 1 is a full payment for the applicable period and is paid by its due date or within any applicable <ref target="1026-54-a-2" reftype="term">grace period</ref>, no late charge may be imposed on the account in connection with the September payment.</content></interpParagraph>
