            <content>A refinancing is a new transaction requiring a complete new set of disclosures. Whether a refinancing has occurred is determined by reference to whether the original obligation has been satisfied or extinguished and replaced by a new obligation, based on the parties' contract and applicable law. The refinancing may involve the consolidation of several existing obligations, disbursement of new money to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> or on the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s behalf, or the rescheduling of payments under an existing obligation.

              <content>A coupon book is a booklet provided to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> with a page for each <ref target="1026-2-a-4" reftype="term">billing cycle</ref> during a set period of time (often covering one year). These pages are designed to be torn off and returned to the servicer with a payment for each <ref target="1026-2-a-4" reftype="term">billing cycle</ref>. Additional information about the loan is often included on or inside the front or back cover, or on filler pages in the coupon book.</content>
