Section <ref target="1026-35-c" reftype="internal">1026.35(c)</ref> does apply, however, to permanent financing that replaces a construction loan, whether the permanent financing is extended by the same or a different <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>, unless the permanent financing is otherwise exempt from the requirements of § <ref target="1026-35-c" reftype="internal">1026.35(c)</ref>. See § <ref target="1026-35-c-2" reftype="internal">1026.35(c)(2)</ref>. When a construction loan may be permanently financed by the same <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>, the general disclosure requirements for <ref target="1026-2-a-10" reftype="term">closed-end credit</ref> (§ <ref target="1026-17" reftype="internal">1026.17</ref>) provide that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may give either one combined disclosure for both the construction financing and the permanent financing, or a separate set of disclosures for each of the two phases as though they were two separate transactions. See § <ref target="1026-17-c-6-ii" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)(6)(ii)</ref> and comment <ref target="1026-17-c-6-Interp-2" reftype="internal">17(c)(6)-2</ref>. Section <ref target="1026-17-c-6-ii" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)(6)(ii)</ref> addresses only how a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may elect to disclose a construction-to-permanent transaction. Which disclosure option a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> elects under § <ref target="1026-17-c-6-ii" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)(6)(ii)</ref> does not affect the determination of whether the permanent phase of the transaction is subject to § <ref target="1026-35-c" reftype="internal">1026.35(c)</ref>. When the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> discloses the two phases as separate transactions, the annual percentage rate for the permanent phase must be compared to the <ref target="1026-35-a-2" reftype="term">average prime offer rate</ref> for a transaction that is comparable to the permanent financing to determine coverage under § <ref target="1026-35-c" reftype="internal">1026.35(c)</ref>. When the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> discloses the two phases as a single transaction, a single annual percentage rate, reflecting the appropriate charges from both phases, must be calculated for the transaction in accordance with § <ref target="1026-35" reftype="internal">1026.35</ref> and <ref target="1026-D" reftype="internal">appendix D</ref> to part 1026.

    <title>35(c)(1)(i) Certified or Licensed Appraiser</title>
    <analysisParagraph>TILA section 129H(b)(3) defines “certified or licensed appraiser” as a person who “(A) is, at a minimum, certified or licensed by the State in which the property to be appraised is located; and (B) performs each appraisal in conformity with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice and title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, and the regulations prescribed under such title, as in effect on the date of the appraisal.” 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(3). Consistent with the statute, the Agencies proposed to define “certified or licensed appraiser” as a person who is certified or licensed by the State agency in the State in which the property that secures the transaction is located, and who performs the appraisal in conformity with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) and the requirements applicable to appraisers in title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, as amended (FIRREA title XI) (12 U.S.C. 3331 et seq.), and any implementing regulations in effect at the time the appraiser signs the appraiser's certification.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>The proposed definition of “certified or licensed appraiser” generally mirrors the statutory language in TILA section 129H(b)(3) regarding State licensing and certification. However, the Agencies proposed to use the defined term “State agency” to clarify that the appraiser must be certified or licensed by a State agency that meets the standards of FIRREA title XI. The proposal defined the term “State agency” to mean a “State appraiser certifying and licensing agency” recognized in accordance with section 1118(b) of FIRREA title XI (12 U.S.C. 3347(b)) and any implementing regulations.<footnote ref="22">If the Appraisal Subcommittee of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council issues certain written findings concerning, among other things, a State agency's failure to recognize and enforce FIRREA title XI standards, appraiser certifications and licenses issued by that State are not recognized for purposes of title XI and appraisals performed by appraisers certified or licensed by that State are not acceptable for federally-related transactions. 12 U.S.C. 3347(b).</footnote>
      See section-by-section analysis of § 1026.35(c)(1)(iv), below.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>As discussed below, the Agencies are adopting the proposed definition of “certified or licensed appraiser” without change.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP). Consistent with the statutory definition of “certified or licensed appraiser,” the proposal incorporated into the proposed definition the requirement that, to be a “certified or licensed appraiser” under the appraisal rules, the appraiser has to perform the appraisal in conformity with the “Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice.” A comment was proposed to clarify that USPAP refers to the professional appraisal standards established by the Appraisal Standards Board of the “Appraisal Foundation,” as defined in FIRREA section 1121(9). 12 U.S.C. 3350(9). The Agencies believe that this terminology is appropriate for consistency with the existing definition in FIRREA title XI and adopt the definition and comment as proposed. See § 1026.35(c)(1)(i) and comment 35(c)(1)(i)-1.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>In addition, TILA section 129H(b)(3) requires that the appraisal be performed in conformity with USPAP “as in effect on the date of the appraisal.” 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(3). The Agencies proposed to incorporate this concept in the definition of “certified or licensed appraiser” and to include a comment clarifying that the “date of the appraisal” is the date on which the appraiser signs the appraiser's certification. Again, the Agencies adopt the definition and comment as proposed. See § 1026.35(c)(1)(i) and comment 35(c)(1)(i)-1. Thus, the relevant edition of USPAP is the one in effect at the time the appraiser signs the appraiser's certification.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>Appraiser's certification. The proposal also included a comment to clarify that the term “appraiser's certification” refers to the certification that must be signed by the appraiser for each appraisal assignment as specified in USPAP Standards Rule 2-3.<footnote ref="23">See Appraisal Standards Bd., Appraisal Fdn., Standards Rule 2-3, USPAP (2012-2013 ed.) at U-29, available at http://www.uspap.org.</footnote>
      The final rule adopts this clarification without change. See comment 35(c)(1)(i)-2.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>FIRREA title XI and implementing regulations. As noted, TILA section 129H(b)(3) defines “certified or licensed appraiser” as a person who is certified or licensed as an appraiser and “performs each appraisal in accordance with [USPAP] and title XI of [FIRREA], and the regulations prescribed under such title, as in effect on the date of the appraisal.” 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(3). Section 1110 of FIRREA directs each Federal financial institutions regulatory agency<footnote ref="24">The Federal financial institutions regulatory agencies are the Board, the FDIC, the OCC, and the NCUA.</footnote>
      to prescribe “appropriate standards for the performance of real estate appraisals in connection with federally related transactions under the jurisdiction of each such agency or instrumentality.” 12 U.S.C. 3339. These rules must require, at a minimum—(1) that real estate appraisals be performed in accordance with generally accepted appraisal standards as evidenced by the appraisal standards promulgated by the Appraisal Standards Board of the Appraisal Foundation; and (2) that such appraisals shall be written appraisals. 12 U.S.C. 3339(1) and (2).</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>The Dodd-Frank Act added a third requirement—that real estate appraisals be subject to appropriate review for compliance with USPAP—for which the Federal financial institutions regulatory agencies must prescribe implementing regulations. FIRREA section 1110(3), 12 U.S.C. 3339(3). FIRREA section 1110 also provides that each Federal banking agency may require compliance with additional standards if the agency determines in writing that additional standards are required to properly carry out its statutory responsibilities. 12 U.S.C. 3339. Accordingly, the Federal financial institutions regulatory agencies have prescribed appraisal regulations implementing FIRREA title XI that set forth, among other requirements, minimum standards for the performance of real estate appraisals in connection with “federally related transactions,” which are defined as real estate-related financial transactions that a Federal banking agency engages in, contracts for, or regulates, and that require the services of an appraiser.<footnote ref="25">See OCC: 12 CFR Part 34, Subpart C; Board: 12 CFR part 208, subpart E, and 12 CFR part 225, subpart G; FDIC: 12 CFR part 323; and NCUA: 12 CFR part 722.</footnote>

    <analysisParagraph>The Agencies' proposal provided that the relevant provisions of FIRREA title XI and its implementing regulations are those selected portions of FIRREA title XI requirements “applicable to appraisers,” in effect at the time the appraiser signs the appraiser's certification. While the Federal financial institutions regulatory agencies' requirements in FIRREA also apply to an institution's ordering and review of an appraisal, the Agencies proposed that the definition of “certified or licensed appraiser” incorporate only FIRREA title XI's minimum standards related to the appraiser's performance of the appraisal. Accordingly, a proposed comment clarified that the relevant standards “applicable to appraisers” are found in regulations prescribed under FIRREA section 1110 (12 U.S.C. 3339) “that relate to an appraiser's development and reporting of the appraisal,” and that paragraph (3) of FIRREA, which relates to the review of appraisals, is not relevant. The Agencies are adopting these proposals as § 1026.35(c)(1)(i) and comment 35(c)(1)(i)-3.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>The Agencies also noted that FIRREA title XI applies by its terms to “federally related transactions” involving a narrower category of loans and institutions than the group of loans and lenders that fall within TILA's definition of “creditor.”<footnote ref="26">TILA section 103(g), 15 U.S.C. 1602(g) (implemented by § 1026.2(a)(17)). See also 12 U.S.C. 3350(4) and OCC: 12 CFR 34.42(f); Board: 12 CFR 225.62(f); FDIC: 12 CFR 323.2(f); and NCUA: 12 CFR 722.2(e) (defining “federally related transaction”).</footnote>
      For example, the FIRREA title XI regulations do not apply to transactions of $250,000 or less.<footnote ref="27">See OCC: 12 CFR 34.43(a)(1); Board: 12 CFR 225.63(a)(1); FDIC: 12 CFR 323.3(a)(1); and NCUA: 12 CFR 722.3(a)(1).</footnote>
      They also do not apply to non-depository institutions.<footnote ref="28">See 12 U.S.C. 3339, 3350(4) (defining “federally related transaction,” (6) (defining “federal financial institutions regulatory agencies”) and (7) (defining “financial institution”).</footnote>
      However, the Agencies believe that Congress, by including the higher-risk mortgage appraisal rules in TILA, which applies to all creditors, demonstrated its intention that all creditors that extend higher-risk mortgage loans, such as independent mortgage companies, should obtain appraisals from appraisers who conform to the standards in FIRREA related to the development and reporting of the appraisal. The Agencies also believe that, by placing this rule in TILA, Congress did not intend to limit its application to loans over $250,000. The Agencies adopt this broader interpretation in the final rule.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>In the proposed rule, the Agencies did not identify specific FIRREA regulations that relate to the appraiser's development and reporting of the appraisal. The Agencies requested comment on whether the final rule should address any particular FIRREA requirements applicable to appraisers that related to the development and reporting of the appraisal. Consistent with the proposal, the final rule does not identify specific FIRREA regulations that relate to the appraiser's development and reporting of the appraisal.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisSection>
      <title>Public Comments on the Proposal</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Appraiser trade associations, a housing advocate, and a credit union commenter agreed that the rule should apply to all qualifying mortgage loans, and not only the subset of the higher-risk mortgage loans already covered by FIRREA, including those loans with a transaction value of $250,000 or less. The appraiser trade associations and the housing advocate commenters believed that all higher-risk mortgages must be included in the rule to ensure that consumers receive the protections offered by appraisals. The housing advocate commenter also believed that including all higher-risk mortgages would reduce risk to all parties involved in the financing and servicing of mortgages and would ensure equal access to credit. This commenter specifically requested that the Agencies at least require an interior appraisal by licensed appraisers for all residential mortgages above $50,000, regardless of whether they are originated or insured by the private sector, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>A banking trade association and a credit union commenter, however, believed that Congress intended the FIRREA requirements to apply only to a subset of higher-risk mortgages that are already covered by FIRREA. The banking trade association commenter believed the Agencies should not require the rule to apply to loans held in portfolio or loans with a value of $250,000 or less, because a bank holding a loan in portfolio has strong incentive to ensure that the property sale is legitimate and the property is properly valued. The commenter also believed the statute intended to apply the rules only to the subset of higher-risk mortgages with a value of over $250,000, as is provided in the Federal financial institutions regulatory agencies' regulations implementing FIRREA. The banking trade association and a bank commenter noted that many community banks, particularly in rural areas, limit costs to consumers by not requiring appraisals on mortgages held in portfolio of $250,000 or less as permitted under FIRREA title XI or by performing cheaper, in-house evaluations of property.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>On whether the final rule should identify specific FIRREA regulations that relate to the development and reporting of the appraisal, the Agencies received one comment letter from appraiser trade associations. These commenters requested that the Agencies specify that creditors must use certified rather than licensed appraisers. The comment is discussed in more detail in the discussion of the use of “certified” versus “licensed” appraisers, below.</analysisParagraph>
    </analysisSection>
    <analysisSection>
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the proposal, the Agencies believe that, by referencing FIRREA requirements in the context of defining “certified or licensed appraiser,” the statute intended to limit FIRREA's requirements to those that apply to the appraiser's development and reporting of performance of the appraisal, rather than the FIRREA requirements that apply to a creditor's ordering and review of the appraisal. TILA section 129H(b)(3), 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(3). The Agencies also did not propose to interpret “certified or licensed appraiser” to include requirements related to appraisal review under FIRREA section 1110(3) because these requirements relate to an institution's responsibilities after receiving the appraisal, rather than to how the certified or licensed appraiser performs the appraisal. Comment 35(c)(1)(i)-3 is consistent with the proposal in this regard. Accordingly, as proposed, the final rule includes a comment clarifying that the requirements of FIRREA section 1110(3) that relate to the “appropriate review” of appraisals are not relevant for purposes of whether an appraiser is a certified or licensed appraiser under the proposal. See comment 35(c)(1)(i)-3.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>At the same time and in light of public comments, the Agencies reviewed the relevant statutory provisions and confirmed their conclusion that applying the FIRREA requirements related to an appraiser's performance of an appraisal broadly—to transactions originated by creditors and transaction types not necessarily subject to FIRREA (such as loans of $250,000 or less)—is wholly consistent with the consumer protection purpose of title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as specific language of the appraisal provisions. For example, the Agencies believe that if Congress intended to limit application of the FIRREA requirements to mortgage loans covered by FIRREA, such as loans of over $250,000 made by Federally-regulated depositories, Congress would have expressly done so. Instead, Congress placed the appraisal requirements, including the definition of “certified and licensed appraiser” referencing FIRREA, in TILA, which applies to loans made by all types of creditors. Moreover, limiting coverage of the Dodd-Frank Act higher-risk mortgage appraisal rules to loans of over $250,000 would eliminate protections for most higher-risk mortgage consumers.<footnote ref="29">According to HMDA data, mean loan size for purchase-money HPMLs in 2011 was $141,600 (median $109,000) and for refinance HPMLs in 2011, mean loans size was $141,600 (median $104,000). In 2010, mean loan size for purchase-money HPMLs was $140,400 (median $100,000) and for refinance HPMLs, mean loan size was $138,600 (median $95,000). See Robert B. Avery, Neil Bhutta, Kenneth B. Brevoort, and Glenn Canner, “The Mortgage Market in 2011: Highlights from the Data Reported under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act,” FR Bulletin, Vol. 98, no. 6 (Dec. 2012) http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2012/PDF/2011_HMDA.pdf.</footnote>
        From a practical standpoint, the Agencies believe that the most reasonable interpretation of the statute is that all mortgage loans meeting the definition of “higher-risk mortgage” are subject to a uniform set of rules, regardless of the type of creditor. This creates a level playing field and ensures the same protections for all consumers of “higher-risk mortgages.” For these reasons, consistent with the proposal, the final rule applies the FIRREA requirements to appraisals for all HPMLs that are not exempt from the regulation. See § 1026.35(c)(2).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>“Certified” versus “licensed” appraiser. Neither TILA section 129H nor the proposed rule defined the individual terms “certified appraiser” and “licensed appraiser,” or specified when a certified appraiser or a licensed appraiser must be used. Instead, the proposed rule required that creditors obtain an appraisal performed by “a certified or licensed appraiser.” 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(1), (b)(2). The Agencies noted in the proposal that certified appraisers generally differ from licensed appraisers based on the examination, education, and experience requirements necessary to obtain each credential. The proposal also stated that existing State and Federal law and regulations require the use of a certified appraiser rather than a licensed appraiser for certain types of transactions. The Agencies requested comment on whether the final rule should address the issue of when a creditor must use a certified appraiser rather than a licensed appraiser.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Consistent with the proposal, the final rule does not separately define “certified” appraiser or “licensed” appraiser, or specify when a creditor should use a “certified” rather than a “licensed” appraiser.</analysisParagraph>
    </analysisSection>
    <analysisSection>
      <title>Public Comments on the Proposal</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Several national and State credit union trade associations believed that the Agencies should not specify when a creditor must use a certified appraiser rather than a licensed appraiser and requested that the Agencies provide creditors with flexibility to make that determination. Some of these commenters noted that State requirements for certified or licensed appraisers may vary significantly; some states may not issue licenses for appraisers, and some may issue different certified appraiser credentials based on the type of property. A financial holding company commenter, on the other hand, requested that the Agencies clarify circumstances under which a lender must use a certified or a licensed appraiser to facilitate compliance.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>On the other hand, appraiser trade association commenters believed that creditors should be required to use only certified appraisers, because the certification is more rigorous than licensure. These commenters stated that the FHA requires newly-eligible appraisers to be certified, and noted that many states have phased out, or are in the process of phasing out, the licensing of appraisers rather than certification. The commenters further stated that when collateral property is complex, the Agencies should require a certified appraiser who is also credentialed by a recognized professional appraisal organization. Similarly, a realtor trade association commenter believed that using certified appraisers was preferable. The commenter believed that the rule should define appraisals for higher-risk mortgages as “complex,” thus requiring that only certified appraisers may perform the appraisals.</analysisParagraph>
    </analysisSection>
    <analysisSection>
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <analysisParagraph>As noted above, several commenters confirmed the Agencies' concerns that State requirements for certified or licensed appraisers may vary significantly and are evolving. Overall, the Agencies believe that imposing specific requirements in this rule about when a certified or licensed appraiser is required goes beyond the scope of the statutory “higher-risk mortgage” appraisal provisions in TILA section 129h. 15 U.S.C. 1639h. The Agencies do not believe that this rule is an appropriate vehicle for guidance on standards for use of a State certified or licensed appraiser that may change over time and vary by jurisdiction. Although the FIRREA appraisal regulations specifically require a “certified” appraiser for certain types of mortgage transactions, the Agencies do not believe that these FIRREA rules are incorporated into the higher-risk mortgage appraisal rules applicable to all creditors. See section-by-section analysis of § 1026.35(c)(1)(i) (defining “certified or licensed appraiser” to incorporate FIRREA requirements related to the development and reporting of the appraisal, not appraiser selection or review). Thus, the final rule need not clarify these rules for entities not subject to the FIRREA appraisal regulations; entities subject to the FIRREA appraisal regulations are familiar with them.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Appraiser competency. In the proposed rule, the Agencies also noted that, in selecting an appraiser for a particular appraisal assignment, creditors typically consider an appraiser's experience, knowledge, and educational background to determine the individual's competency to appraise a particular property and in a particular market. The proposed rule did not specify competency standards, but the Agencies requested comment on whether the rule should address appraiser competency. In keeping with the proposal, the final rule does not specify competency standards for appraisers.</analysisParagraph>
    </analysisSection>
    <analysisSection>
      <title>Public Comments on the Proposal</title>
      <analysisParagraph>A realtor trade association commenter suggested that the rule incorporate guidance from the Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines<footnote ref="30">75 FR 77450, 77465-68 (Dec. 10, 2010).</footnote>
        regarding creditors' criteria for selecting, evaluating, and monitoring the performance of appraisers. However, a banking trade association, a financial holding company, appraiser trade association, and several national and State credit union trade association commenters stated that the Agencies should not require creditors to apply specific competency standards for appraisers. Several commenters asserted that competency standards would result in increased regulatory burden and cost, and a banking trade association expressed concern that requiring creditors to implement subjective competency standards could raise conflict of interest issues with respect to appraiser independence.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Appraiser trade association commenters suggested that instead of setting forth competency standards, the Agencies should require a creditor to ensure that the engagement letter properly lays out the required scope of work, that the appraiser is independent, and that the appraiser possesses the appropriate experience to perform the assignment including, when necessary, geographic competency. The financial holding company commenter suggested that the rule should reference FIRREA and require creditors to ensure that appraisers are in good standing. The banking trade association commenter believed that the Agencies should include a reference to USPAP to create a uniform competency standard. One State credit union association believed that the Agencies should permit creditors to rely on appraisers' representations regarding licensing and certification.</analysisParagraph>
    </analysisSection>
    <analysisSection>
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies believe that the many aspects of appraiser competency are beyond the scope of TILA's “higher-risk mortgage” provisions defining “certified or licensed appraiser,” which do not mention competency. Appraiser competency is addressed in a number of regulations and guidelines for Federally-regulated depositories, which are expected to know and follow rules and guidance under FIRREA regarding appraiser competency.<footnote ref="31">See, e.g., id. at 77465-68 (Dec. 10, 2010). Appraiser competency is critical to the quality and accuracy of residential mortgage appraisals. As a commenter noted, the federal banking agencies provide guidance in the Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines regarding creditors' criteria for selecting, evaluating, and monitoring the performance of appraisers.

      <analysisParagraph>TILA section 129H(f) expressly excludes from the definition of higher-risk mortgage any loan that is a qualified mortgage as defined in TILA section 129C and a reverse mortgage loan that is a qualified mortgage as defined in TILA section 129C. 15 U.S.C. 1639(f). Rather than implement one exclusion for qualified mortgages and a separate exclusion for any reverse mortgage loans that may be defined by the Bureau as qualified mortgages, the Agencies proposed to provide a single exclusion for a qualified mortgage as that term would be defined in the Bureau's final rule implementing TILA section 129C. 15 U.S.C. 1639c.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Before authority regarding TILA section 129C transferred to the Bureau under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Board issued the 2011 ATR Proposal, which, among other things, would have defined a “qualified mortgage” in a new subsection of Regulation Z. 12 CFR 226.43(e). See 76 FR 27390, 27484-85 (May 11, 2011). During the proposal period for the “higher-risk mortgage” rule, the Bureau had not yet issued final rules implementing TILA section 129C's definition of “qualified mortgage.” Since that time, the Bureau has issued rules defining “qualified mortgage.” See 2013 ATR Final Rule, § 1026.43(e). Consistent with the proposed definition of “qualified mortgage,” the Bureau's final rule defines “qualified mortgage” as generally including loans characterized by the absence of certain features considered risky, such as negative amortization and balloon payments.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>All commenters—including national and State credit union trade associations, as well as national and State banking trade associations—supported this exemption. Some banking trade associations believed the exemption was appropriate because qualified mortgages, by definition, are safe and sound transactions. Other banking and credit union trade associations expressed concern that they could not comment specifically on the exemption, because the term was not yet defined by the Bureau.</analysisParagraph>
    </analysisSection>
    <analysisSection>
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The final rule incorporates the exemption for “qualified mortgages” as proposed because the exemption is prescribed by statute and widely supported by commenters. The Agencies note that some commenters requested that the final rule also exempt “qualified residential mortgages,” which the Dodd-Frank Act exempts from the risk retention rules prescribed by the Act. See Dodd-Frank Act section 941, section 15G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 780-11(c)(1)(C)(iii). A qualified residential mortgage, however, is by statute to be defined by regulation as “no broader than” the definition of qualified mortgage prescribed by the Bureau in its 2013 ATR Final Rule. See id. at sec. 780-11(e)(4)(C). Therefore, the exemption for qualified mortgages will capture all qualified residential mortgages and a separate exemption is not necessary.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Transactions Secured by a New Manufactured Home</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies proposed to exclude from coverage of the higher-risk mortgage appraisal rules any loan secured solely by a residential structure, such as a manufactured home.<footnote ref="32">The Agencies proposed to exclude from the definition of “higher-risk mortgage loan” any loans secured solely by a “residential structure,” as that term is used in Regulation Z's definition of “dwelling.” See 12 CFR 1026.2(a)(19). The provision was intended to exclude loans that are not secured in whole or in part by land. Thus, for example, loans secured by manufactured homes that are not also secured by the land on which they are sited were proposed to be excluded from the definition of higher-risk mortgage loan, regardless of whether the manufactured home itself is deemed to be personal property or real property under applicable State law.</footnote>
        The Agencies believed that requiring appraisals performed by certified or licensed appraisers was not appropriate, because such transactions typically more closely resemble titled vehicle loans. At the same time, based on outreach, the Agencies believed that for loans for residential structures, such as manufactured homes that are secured by both the home and the land to which the home is attached, appraisals performed by certified or licensed appraisers are feasible. Such transactions were therefore covered by the proposed rule. The Agencies believed the exemption for a loan secured solely by a residential structure was appropriate pursuant to the exemption authority under TILA section 129H(b)(4)(B). 15 U.S.C. 1026.35(b)(4)(B).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies requested comment on whether the proposed exclusion was appropriate, and if not, reasonable methods by which creditors could comply with the requirements of this proposed rule when providing loans secured solely by a residential structure. The Agencies also requested comment on whether some alternative standards for valuing residential structures securing higher-risk mortgage loans might be feasible and appropriate to include as part of the final rule, in lieu of an appraisal performed by a certified or licensed appraiser.</analysisParagraph>
    </analysisSection>
    <analysisSection>
      <title>Public Comments on the Proposal</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Commenters, including national and State credit union trade associations, a manufactured housing industry consultant, manufactured housing trade associations, a realtor trade association, a lender specializing in manufactured housing financing, and national and State banking trade associations, submitted comments regarding the exemption for loans secured “solely by a residential structure,” but limited their comments to the exemption as applied to manufactured homes. The commenters supported exempting loans secured solely by manufactured homes. Banking trade association commenters believed that the statute was intended to apply only to loans secured at least in part by real property. A manufactured housing industry consultant, a manufactured housing lender, and manufactured housing trade association commenters concurred that traditional appraisals were not appropriate for these transactions for a variety of reasons, including: (1) A lack of qualified and trained appraisers to appraise such transactions, especially in rural areas; (2) a lack of comparable sales and limited sales volume; (3) the high expense of appraisals relative to the cost of the transaction; and (4) inaccurate valuations resulting from traditional appraisals. The manufactured housing industry consultant suggested that an exemption was necessary in part because these loans were unlikely to qualify for the qualified mortgage exemption due to their small size, which would in turn increase the likelihood that they would exceed the points and fees thresholds defining qualified mortgages. See § 1026.43(e)(3).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Some of the commenters believed the Agencies should expand the exemption to include financing for both real estate and manufactured homes, known as “land home” financing. Manufactured housing trade association commenters argued that traditional appraisals are not appropriate for these transactions for many of the same reasons cited for excluding loans secured solely by a residential structure. One of these manufactured housing trade associations also expressed the view that appraisals are not appropriate because the cost of the home itself is readily known to consumers through other means. In addition, the commenter stated that in rural areas, the cost of the land is small compared to the overall value of the transaction.<footnote ref="33">Note, however, that another manufactured housing trade association commenter stated that the majority of manufactured homes are not considered an improvement or enhancement of the real property on which they are sited.</footnote>
        This commenter recommended that if the Agencies did not exclude all land home transactions, the Agencies in the alternative should at least exclude those land home transactions that are under $125,000 or that are in a rural area.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One commenter also questioned the feasibility of appraisals for such transactions. A lender specializing in manufactured housing financing stated that, in land home transactions, the land on which manufactured homes will be located is often not identified until well after the time appraisals are typically ordered. Moreover, the commenter stated that manufactured homes are typically not available for an interior visit until after closing, regardless of whether the transaction is secured solely by the home itself or by land and home together. As an alternative, the commenter suggested different regulatory language for the exclusion, which would expand the exemption to land home transactions and would incorporate an existing definition of “manufactured home” to clearly eliminate site-built manufactured homes from the exemption.</analysisParagraph>
    </analysisSection>
    <analysisSection>
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Public commenters generally confirmed Agencies' concerns regarding the application of the appraisal rules to loans secured by certain manufactured homes. Accordingly, the Agencies are excluding certain manufactured homes from coverage under the final rule. However, in the final rule, the Agencies are modifying the exemption. The proposed rule would have exempted loans “secured solely by a residential structure,” which was intended to exempt manufactured homes and other types of dwellings when the loan was not secured at least in part by land. The language in the final rule is tailored to exempt transactions secured by specific types of dwellings. Accordingly, the final rule exempts transactions secured by a new manufactured home, regardless of whether the structure is attached to land or considered real property, and also exempts transactions secured by a mobile home, boat, or trailer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies believe that the manufactured home exemption should be based on whether the manufactured home securing the transaction is a new home, regardless of whether land also secures the transaction. Upon further consideration, the Agencies believe that TILA section 129H is intended to apply to certain transactions without regard to whether a transaction is secured by land.<footnote ref="34">The Agencies note that the definition of “higher-risk mortgage loan” in TILA section 129H incorporates the definition of “residential mortgage loan.” TILA section 129H(f). A residential mortgage loan is defined, in part, to include loans involving certain types of dwellings that are non-real estate residences. TILA section 103(cc)(5). For example, cooperatives are specifically described as dwellings under TILA section 103(w). Moreover, although TILA section 129H requires appraisals that conform to FIRREA title XI, the Agencies do not believe that TILA section 129H is limited to transactions subject to FIRREA title XI or other Federal regulations. Thus, the Agencies believe the statute intended to apply the appraisal requirements to some loans that are not secured by land.</footnote>
        Thus, the approach in the final rule is focused on the feasibility and utility of requiring certified or licensed appraisers to perform appraisals for particular manufactured home transactions.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies believe that an exemption for new manufactured homes regardless of whether the loan for such a home is also secured by land more precisely excludes from the rule those transactions that should not be subject to the new appraisal requirements. Based on further outreach, the Agencies understand that for loans secured by both new manufactured homes and land, a valuation is often performed by combining the manufactured home invoice price with the value of the land, rather than by a traditional appraisal that is based on the collective value of the structure and the land on which it is sited.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies believe that requiring traditional appraisals with interior inspections for transactions secured by a new manufactured home would add very little value to the consumer beyond existing valuation methods. Moreover, because it may be difficult or impossible to retain qualified appraisers to perform such appraisals, the rule could result in some creditors declining to extend loans for manufactured homes. Exempting new manufactured homes from the rule is, therefore, in the public interest. The Agencies believe that such an exemption also promotes the safety and soundness of creditors, because creditors will be able to continue relying on standardized valuations that are more conducive to pricing new manufactured homes than are appraisals performed by a certified or licensed appraiser.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, in § 1026.35(c)(2)(ii), the Agencies are exempting from the appraisal requirements of § 1026.35(c) a transaction secured by a new manufactured home. Comment 35(c)(2)(ii)-1 in the final rule clarifies that a transaction secured by a new manufactured home, regardless of whether the transaction is also secured by the land on which it is sited, is not a “higher-priced mortgage loan” subject to the appraisal requirements of § 1026.35(c).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Transaction Secured by Mobile Home, Boat, or Trailer</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Section 1026.35(c)(2)(iii) of the final rule also specifically exempts transactions secured by a mobile home, boat, or trailer. This is consistent with the proposal, which would have exempted these transactions because they are secured “solely by a residential structure.” The Agencies note that this exemption applies even if the transaction is also secured by land. Comment 35(c)(2)(iii)-1 clarifies that, for purposes of the exemption in § 1026.35(c)(2)(iii), a mobile home does not include a manufactured home, as defined in § 1026.35(c)(1)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies believe the exemption is in the public interest, because requiring an appraisal with an interior property visit for these transactions would offer limited value due to existing pricing tools, such as new product invoices and publicly-available pricing guides. The Agencies further believe, for purposes of safety and soundness, that creditors would be better served by using other valuation methods geared specifically for mobile homes, boats, and trailers.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Construction Loans</title>
      <analysisParagraph>In the proposal, the Agencies asked for comment on whether to exempt from the higher-risk mortgage appraisal rules transactions that finance the construction of a new home. The Agencies recognized that for loans that finance the construction of a new home, an interior visit of the property securing the loan is generally not feasible because the homes are proposed to be built or are in the process of being built. At the same time, the Agencies recognized that construction loans that meet the pricing thresholds for higher-risk mortgage loans could pose many of the same risks to consumers as other types of loans meeting those thresholds. The Agencies therefore requested comment on whether to exclude construction loans from the definition of higher-risk mortgage loan. The Agencies also sought comment on whether, if an exemption for initial construction loans were not adopted in the final rule, creditors needed any additional compliance guidance for applying TILA's “higher-risk mortgage” appraisal rules to construction loans. Alternatively, the Agencies requested comment on whether construction loans should be exempt only from the requirement to conduct an interior visit of the property, and be subject to all other appraisal requirements under the proposed rule.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The final rule adopts an exemption from all of the HPML appraisal requirements for a “transaction that finances the initial construction of a dwelling.” This exemption mirrors an existing exemption from the current HPML rules. See existing § 1026.35(a)(3), also retained in the 2013 Escrows Final Rule, § 1026.35(b)(2)(i)(B).</analysisParagraph>

    <analysisSection>
      <title>Public Comments on the Proposal</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Appraiser trade association commenters believed that new construction loans should not be exempted because consumers needed the protection of the appraisal rules. However, all other commenters—including national and State credit union trade associations, national and State banking trade associations, banks, a mortgage company, a financial holding company, a home builder trade association, and a loan origination software company—supported the proposed exemption.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Commenters that supported an exemption for new construction loans had varying views on the risks associated with these loans, all supporting the commenters' request for an exemption for such loans. A loan origination software company and a bank commenter asserted that new construction loan interest rates and fees are often high because the loans, which are short-term, have inherently greater risk. Thus, the appraisal rules would be over-inclusive because they would apply even when extended to prime borrowers. Similarly, a banking association commenter argued that new construction loans are not those that Congress intended to target in the appraisal rules, which the commenter viewed as loans priced higher due to the relative credit risk of the borrower. The home builder trade association, however, supported an exemption because the commenter believed that new construction loans are not as risky as the loans targeted by Congress in the “higher-risk mortgage” appraisal rules because these loans require close coordination between a bank, home builder, and consumer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The financial holding company, mortgage company, banking association, and loan origination software company commenters supported an exemption for new construction loans because they are temporary. One of these commenters noted that most mortgage-related regulations, such as those in Regulation X and Z, make accommodations for temporary loans. Others noted that the property securing the new construction loan ultimately will be subject to an appraisal under TILA's “higher-risk mortgage” appraisal rules if the permanent financing replacing the new construction loan is a “higher-risk mortgage.”</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Several commenters supporting an exemption cited concerns about the feasibility and utility of performing interior inspection appraisals during the construction phase. A bank commenter stated that an exemption was needed because a home under construction is not available for a physical inspection. Similarly, credit union association and banking association commenters stated that an interior visit would not be feasible during the construction phase. Moreover, the commenter believed an appraisal was unlikely to yield sufficient information about the condition of the property to justify the expense to the consumer. A banking association commenter further asserted that the usual value of a new construction loan is the value “at completion,” so an appraisal performed during construction would not assess the value of a completed home.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>A State banking association commenter asserted that failing to exempt new construction loans from the final rule would result in operational difficulties and that an interior inspection appraisal would be of little value to consumers in these circumstances. A bank commenter requested guidance on how to comply with the rules for these loans, if the Agencies did not exempt them from the rule.</analysisParagraph>

    <analysisSection>
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <analysisParagraph>In § 1026.35(c)(2)(iv), the Agencies are using their exemption authority to exempt from the final rule a “transaction to finance the initial construction of a dwelling.” Unlike the exemption for “bridge” loans that the Agencies are also adopting (see section-by-section analysis of § 1026.35(c)(2)(v), below), the exemption for new construction loans is not limited to loans of twelve months or less. This is because the Agencies recognize that new construction might take longer than twelve months and that therefore new construction loans might be for terms of longer than twelve months. This aspect of the exemption adopted in the final rule also reflects the existing exemption for new construction loans from the current HPML rules. See § 1026.35(a)(3).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies' decision to exempt these types of transactions is consistent with wide support for this exemption received from commenters, which largely confirmed the Agencies' concerns about the drawbacks of subjecting these transactions to the new HPML appraisal requirements, particularly the requirement for an interior inspection, USPAP-compliant appraisal. The Agencies also believe that this exemption is important to ensure consistency across mortgage rules, and thus to facilitate compliance. In addition to noting the existing exemption for new construction loans from the current HPML requirements, the Agencies also note the exemption for these loans from the new Dodd-Frank Act ability-to-repay and “high-cost” mortgage rules issued by the Bureau. See 2013 ATR Final Rule, § 1026.43(a)(3)(ii), and 2013 HOEPA Final Rule, § 1026.32(a)(2)(ii).<footnote ref="35">Moreover, the existing “high-cost” mortgage rules contain a longstanding exemption for construction loans from the limitation on balloon payments. See existing § 1026.32(d)(1)(i).</footnote></analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Due to their temporary nature and for other reasons, these loans tend to have higher rates and thus more of them would be subject to the HPML appraisal rules without an exemption. Applying the HPML appraisal rules to these products might subject them to rules with which creditors might not in fact be able to comply. The Agencies therefore believe that this exemption will help ensure that a useful credit vehicle for consumers remains available to build and revitalize communities. The Agencies also recognize that new construction loans can be an important product for many creditors, enabling them to strengthen and diversify their lending portfolios. The Agencies are also not aware of, and commenters did not offer, evidence of widespread valuation abuses in loans to finance new construction. Thus, the Agencies find that the exemption is both in the public interest and promotes the safety and soundness of creditors. See TILA section 129H(b)(4)(B), 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(4)(B).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies also wished to clarify in the final rule the treatment of “construction to permanent” loans, consisting of a single loan that transforms into permanent financing at the end of the construction phase. For this reason, the commentary of the final rule includes guidance on the application of various rules in Regulation Z to these loans that parallels guidance provided in commentary for the new “high-cost” mortgage rules. See 2013 HOEPA Final Rule, comment 32(a)(2)(ii)-1. Specifically, comment 35(c)(2)(iv)-1 clarifies that the exclusion for loans to finance the initial construction of a dwelling applies to a construction-only loan as well as to the construction phase of a construction-to-permanent loan. The comment further clarifies that the HPML appraisal rules in § 1026.35(c) do apply if the permanent financing qualifies as an HPML under § 1026.35(a)(1) and is not otherwise exempt from the rules under § 1026.35(c)(2).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The comment also provides guidance on the application of Regulation Z's general closed-end mortgage loan disclosure requirements to construction-to-permanent loans. To this end, the comment states that, when a construction loan may be permanently financed by the same creditor, the general disclosure requirements for closed-end credit (§ 1026.17) provide that the creditor may give either one combined disclosure for both the construction financing and the permanent financing, or a separate set of disclosures for each of the two phases as though they were two separate transactions. See § 1026.17(c)(6)(ii) and comment 17(c)(6)-2. The comment explains that § 1026.17(c)(6)(ii) addresses only how a creditor may elect to disclose a construction-to-permanent transaction, and that which disclosure option a creditor elects under § 1026.17(c)(6)(ii) does not affect whether the permanent phase of the transaction is subject to § 1026.35(c). The comment further explains that, when the creditor discloses the two phases as separate transactions, the annual percentage rate for the permanent phase must be compared to the average prime offer rate for a transaction that is comparable to the permanent financing to determine coverage under § 1026.35(c). The comment also explains that, when the creditor discloses the two phases as a single transaction, a single annual percentage rate, reflecting the appropriate charges from both phases, must be calculated for the transaction in accordance with § 1026.35 and appendix D to part 1026. The comment also clarifies that the APR must be compared to the APOR for a transaction that is comparable to the permanent financing to determine coverage under § 1026.35(c). If the transaction is determined to be an HPML that is not otherwise exempt under § 1026.35(c)(2), only the permanent phase is subject to the HPML appraisal requirements of § 1026.35(c).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Bridge Loans</title>
      <analysisParagraph>In the proposal, the Agencies also requested comment on whether the appraisal rules of TILA section 129H should apply to temporary or “bridge” loans with a term of 12 months or less. 15 U.S.C. 1639h. If such an exemption were not adopted, the Agencies sought comment on whether any additional compliance guidance would be needed for applying the new appraisal rules to bridge loans. The Agencies stated concerns about the burden to both creditors and consumers of imposing the rule's requirements on such loans and questioned whether such requirements would be useful for many consumers.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As explained in the proposal, bridge loans are short-term loans typically used when a consumer is buying a new home before selling the consumer's existing home. Usually secured by the existing home, a bridge loan provides financing for the new home (often in the form of the down payment) or mortgage payment assistance until the consumer can sell the existing home and secure permanent financing. Bridge loans normally carry higher interest rates, points and fees than conventional mortgages, regardless of the consumer's creditworthiness.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In § 1026.35(c)(2)(v), the final rule adopts an exemption from the new HPML appraisal rules for a “loan with a maturity of 12 months or less, if the purpose of the loan is a `bridge' loan connected with the acquisition of a dwelling intended to become the consumer's principal dwelling.”</analysisParagraph>
    </analysisSection>
    <analysisSection>
      <title>Public Comments on the Proposal</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Almost all commenters—including national and State banking associations, national and State credit union associations, a mortgage company, a financial holding company, a loan origination software company, a home builder trade association, and a bank—supported an exemption for bridge loans for many of the same reasons that commenters supported exempting construction loans. Several commenters emphasized that these loans are temporary, and some further pointed out that imposing appraisal requirements was unnecessary because bridge loans are ultimately converted to permanent financing that will be subject to the appraisal rules. Other commenters argued that the protections of the appraisal rules were not needed because bridge loans' higher rates are generally unrelated to a consumer's creditworthiness; they argued that TILA's new “higher-risk mortgage” appraisal rules were intended for loans made to more vulnerable, less creditworthy consumers without other credit options.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Some commenters asserted that failing to exempt these loans would result in operational difficulties and would be of little value to consumers. In this regard, one commenter discussed the difficulties of comparing an APR to a “comparable” APOR for these loans. One credit union association commenter believed that without an exemption, consumers' access to bridge loans would be reduced. Some commenters requested that the Agencies exempt all types of temporary loans. Appraiser trade association commenters believed that the Agencies should not allow an exemption unless there was a compelling policy reason to do so.</analysisParagraph>
    </analysisSection>
    <analysisSection>
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies are adopting an exemption for “bridge” loans of 12 months or less that are connected with the acquisition of a dwelling intended to become the consumer's principal dwelling for several reasons. First, the Agencies believe that with this exemption, the consumer would still be afforded the protection of the appraisal rules. This is because bridge loans used in connection with the acquisition of a new home are typically secured by the consumer's existing home to facilitate the purchase of a new home. Thus, the consumer would be afforded the protections of the appraisal rules on the permanent financing secured by the new home. This would include the protections of § 1026.35(c)(4)(i) regarding properties that are potentially fraudulent flips.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Second, commenters generally confirmed the Agencies' concerns expressed in the proposal about the burden to both creditors and consumers of imposing TILA section 129H's heightened appraisal requirements on short-term financing of this nature. As noted in the proposal, the Agencies recognize that rates on short-term bridge loans are often higher than on long-term home mortgages, so these loans may be more likely to meet the “higher-risk mortgage loan” triggers. As also noted in the proposal and echoed by commenters, “higher-risk mortgages” under TILA section 129H would generally be a credit option for less creditworthy consumers, who may be more vulnerable than others and in need of enhanced consumer protections, such as TILA section 129H's special appraisal requirements. However, a bridge loan consumer could be subject to rates that would exceed the higher-risk mortgage loan thresholds even if the consumer would qualify for a non-higher-risk mortgage loan when seeking permanent financing. The Agencies do not believe that Congress intended TILA section 129H to apply to loans simply because they have higher rates, regardless of the consumer's creditworthiness or the purpose of the loan.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Further, the Agencies recognize that the exemption can help facilitate compliance by generally ensuring consistency across residential mortgage rules. Such consistency can reduce compliance-related burdens and risks, thereby promoting the safety and soundness of creditors. The Agencies also believe that consistency across the rules can reduce operational risk and support a creditor's ability to offer these loans, which can enable creditors to strengthen and diversify their lending portfolios.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In particular, the Agencies note the current exemption for “temporary or `bridge' loans of twelve months or less from the existing HPML rules (retained in the 2013 Escrows Final Rule, § 1026.35(b)(2)(i)(C)), but also a similar exemption from TILA's new ability-to-repay requirements. See existing § 1026.35(a)(3). See TILA section 129C(a)(8), 15 U.S.C. 1639c(a)(8); 2013 ATR Final Rule, § 1026.43(a)(3)(ii).<footnote ref="36">The exemption for “temporary or `bridge' loans of twelve months or less” in TILA's ability-to-repay rules codifies an exemption from the current “high-cost” and HPML repayment ability requirements. See existing §§ 1026.34(a)(4)(v), 1026.35(a)(3) and (b)(1).</footnote>
        In addition, longstanding HOEPA rules have included an exception from the balloon payment prohibition for “loans with maturities of less than one year, if the purpose of the loan is a `bridge' loan connected with the acquisition or construction of a dwelling intended to become the consumer's principal dwelling.” § 1026.32(d)(1)(ii). The final HOEPA rules adopted by the Bureau contain the same exception with minor changes for conformity across mortgage rules. See 2013 HOEPA Final Rule, § 1026.32(d)(1)(ii)(B) (revising the exception to cover bridge loans of 12 months or less, rather than less than one year).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Like the HOEPA exception from the balloon payment prohibition, the final HPML appraisal rule does not exempt all loans with terms of 12 months or less. Only bridge loans of 12 months or less that are made in connection with the acquisition of a consumer's principal dwelling are exempted. (Construction loans are separately exempted under § 1026.35(c)(2)(iv), discussed in the corresponding section-by-section analysis above.) The Agencies believe that the HPML appraisal rule might be appropriately applied to other types of temporary financing, particularly temporary financing that does not result in the consumer ultimately obtaining permanent financing covered by the appraisal rule.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, as with new construction loans, the Agencies are not aware of, and commenters did not offer, evidence of widespread valuation abuses in bridge loans of twelve months or less used in connection with the acquisition of a consumer's principal dwelling. For all these reasons, the Agencies find that the exemption is both in the public interest and promotes the safety and soundness of creditors. See TILA section 129H(b)(4)(B), 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(4)(B).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Reverse Mortgage Transactions</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies proposed to exempt reverse mortgage transactions subject to § 1026.33(a) from the definition of “higher-risk mortgage loan.” The Agencies proposed this exemption in part because the proprietary (private) reverse mortgage market is effectively nonexistent, thus the vast majority of reverse mortgage transactions made in the United States today are insured by FHA as part of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) Program.<footnote ref="37">See Bureau, Reverse Mortgages: Report to Congress 14, 70-99 (June 28, 2012), available at http://www.consumerfinance.gov/reports/reverse-mortgages-report (Bureau Reverse Mortgage Report).</footnote>
        The Agencies stated that TILA's new “higher-risk mortgage” appraisal rules are arguably unnecessary because HECM creditors must adhere to specific standards designed to protect both the creditor and the consumer, including robust appraisal rules.<footnote ref="38">See HUD Handbook 4235.1, ch. 3.</footnote>
        In addition, a methodology for determining APORs for reverse mortgage transactions does not currently exist, so creditors would be unable to determine whether the APR of a given reverse mortgage transaction exceeded the rate thresholds defining a “higher-risk mortgage loan” (HPML in the final rule).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>At the same time, the Agencies expressed concern that providing a permanent exemption for all reverse mortgage transactions, both private and HECM products, could deny key protections to consumers who rely on reverse mortgages. However, the Agencies proposed the exemption on at least a temporary basis, asserting that avoiding any potential disruption of this segment of the mortgage market in the near term would be in the public interest and promote the safety and soundness of creditors.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies requested comment on the appropriateness of this exemption. The Agencies also sought comment on whether available indices exist that track the APR for reverse mortgages and could be used by the Bureau to develop and publish an APOR for these transactions, or whether such an index could be developed, noting, for example, information published by HUD on HECMs, including the contract rate.<footnote ref="39">See http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/housing/rmra/oe/rpts/hecm/hecmmenu (“Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Characteristics”).</footnote></analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed further below, in § 1026.35(c)(2)(vi) of the final rule, the Agencies are adopting the proposed exemption for a “reverse-mortgage transaction subject to § 1026.33(a).”</analysisParagraph>
    </analysisSection>
    <analysisSection>
      <title>Public Comments on the Proposal</title>
      <analysisParagraph>National and State credit union trade associations, as well as a State banking trade association, supported the proposed exemption. However, appraiser trade association commenters generally believed that excluding appraisal protections would harm consumers, particularly senior citizens, and is contrary to public policy. Appraiser trade association, realtor trade association, and reverse mortgage lending trade association commenters suggested that any exemption should be limited to reverse mortgages under the FHA HECM program and not extended to proprietary products, because HECM consumers are afforded a comprehensive and mandatory set of appraisal protections. The reverse mortgage lending trade association also suggested circumstances under which reverse mortgages should be deemed qualified mortgages and, thus, qualify for an exemption on that basis. See section-by-section analysis of § 1026.35(c)(2)(i).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>No commenters offered suggestions on an appropriate approach for developing an APOR for reverse mortgages. Appraiser trade associations, who only supported an exemption for HECMs, believed that the rules should apply to reverse mortgages even though indices do not currently exist. A reverse mortgage lending trade association believed that benchmark indices for reverse mortgages could be developed, but, supporting the proposed exemption, questioned whether one should be.</analysisParagraph>
    </analysisSection>
    <analysisSection>
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies are adopting the proposed exemption for a “reverse-mortgage transaction subject to § 1026.33” for the same basic reasons discussed in the proposal, which were affirmed by most commenters. The Agencies share concerns expressed by some commenters about the risks to consumers of reverse mortgages generally, and of proprietary reverse mortgage loans in particular. Proprietary reverse mortgage loans are not insured by FHA or any other government entity, so payments are not guaranteed by the U.S. government to either consumers or creditors. By contrast, HECMs are insured by FHA and subject to a number of rules and restrictions designed to reduce risk to both consumers and creditors, including appraisal rules. See TILA section 129H(b)(4)(B), 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(4)(B).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As noted in the proposal, however, there is little to no market for proprietary reverse mortgages, and prospects for the reemergence of this market in the near-term are remote.<footnote ref="40">Bureau Reverse Mortgage Report at 137-38.</footnote>
        HECMs comprise virtually the entire reverse mortgage market and are subject to FHA's extensive HECM rules, which include appraisal requirements.<footnote ref="41">See HUD Handbook 4235.1, ch. 3.</footnote>
        In addition, the Agencies believe that unwarranted creditor liability and operational risk could arise if the rule were applied to loans that a creditor cannot definitively determine are in fact subject to the rule, as is the case here, where no rate benchmark exists for measuring whether a reverse mortgage loan is an HPML. Thus, without an exemption for reverse mortgages, creditors would be susceptible to risks that could negatively affect their safety and soundness.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In reevaluating the proposed exemption, the Agencies also focused more attention on the fact that TILA's “higher-risk mortgage” appraisal rules apply only to closed-end products. Many (and historically most) reverse mortgages are open-end products. The Agencies are concerned about creating anomalies in the market and compliance confusion among creditors by applying one set of rules to closed-end reverse mortgages and another to open-end reverse mortgages. The Agencies note that compliance confusion among creditors can create burden and operational risk that can have a negative impact on the safety and soundness of the creditors. The Agencies are concerned that this bifurcation of the rule's application could also hinder creditors from offering a range of reverse mortgage product choices that support the creditors' loan portfolios while also benefitting consumers. In short, questions remain for the Agencies about whether this rule is the appropriate vehicle for addressing appraisal issues in the reverse mortgage market.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies remain concerned about the potential for abuse related to appraisals even with HECMs, which are subject to appraisal rules. Indeed, evidence exists that problems of property value inflation and fraudulent flipping occur even in the HECM market.<footnote ref="42">Bureau Reverse Mortgage Report at 154, 157.</footnote>
        The Agencies plan to continue monitoring the reverse mortgage market closely and address appraisal issues as needed, including through consultations with the Bureau regarding any initiatives to revisit previously-issued reverse mortgage proposals (76 FR 58539, 53638-58659 (Sept. 24, 2012)).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For all these reasons, the Agencies have concluded that an exemption for all reverse mortgages at this time from this rule is in the public interest and promotes the safety and soundness of creditors.<footnote ref="43">By statute, the term “higher-risk mortgage” excludes any “qualified mortgage” and any “reverse mortgage loan that is a qualified mortgage.” 15 U.S.C. 1639h(f). The Bureau was authorized by the Dodd-Frank Act to define the term “qualified mortgage” and has done so in its 2013 ATR Final Rule. However, the 2013 ATR Final Rule does not define the types of reverse mortgage loans that should be considered “qualified mortgages” because, by statute, TILA's ability-to-repay rules do not apply to reverse mortgages. See TILA section 129C(a)(8), 15 U.S.C. 1639c(a)(8). Thus the Agencies are not able to implement the precise statutory exemption for “reverse mortgage loans that are qualified mortgages.” Instead, the exemption for reverse mortgages is based on the Agencies' express authority to exempt from TILA's “higher-risk mortgage” appraisal rules “a class of loans,” if the exemption “is in the public interest and promotes the safety and soundness of creditors.” TILA section 129H(b)(4)(B), 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(4)(B).</footnote></analysisParagraph>

    <analysisParagraph>• Loans to finance new construction of a dwelling;</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>• Temporary or “bridge” loans, typically used to purchase a new dwelling where the consumer plans to sell the consumer's current dwelling; and</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>• Loans secured by properties in “rural” areas. For this last exemption, the Agencies requested comment on how to define “rural”; specifically, whether to define it as the Board did in its proposal to implement Dodd-Frank Act ability-to-repay requirements under TILA section 129C. See 15 U.S.C. 1639c; 76 FR 27390 (May 11, 2011) (2011 ATR Proposal) (and also in the 2011 Escrows Proposal), discussed in more detail below.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Agencies requested comment on whether commenters believed that any other types of loans should be exempt from the final rule.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>The final rule adopts two of the proposed exemptions: qualified mortgages and reverse mortgages. See § 1026.35(c)(2)(i) and (vi). The final rule also adopts exemptions for loans secured by new manufactured homes and by mobile homes, boats, or trailers, which replace the proposed exemption for loans secured solely by a residential structure. See § 1026.35(c)(2)(ii) (new manufactured homes) and (iii) (mobile homes, boats, or trailers). In addition, the final rule exempts the two types of loans on which the Agencies specifically requested comment: new construction loans and bridge loans. See § 1026.35(c)(2)(iv) (construction loans) and (v) (bridge loans).</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>In addition, based on public comments, the Agencies intend to publish a supplemental proposal to request comment on possible exemptions for “streamlined” refinance programs and small dollar loans, as well as to seek comment on whether application of the HPML appraisal rule to loans secured by certain other property types, such as existing manufactured homes, is appropriate.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>Exemptions from the HPML appraisal rules of § 1026.35(c) are set out in new § 1026.35(c)(2). The structure of the final rule differs from that of the proposed rule. The proposed rule excluded certain loan types from the definition of “higher-risk mortgage loan” and thereby excluded these loan types from coverage of all of the “higher-risk mortgage” appraisal rules. By contrast, the final rule defines a general term—HPML—and incorporates exemptions from the appraisal rules in a separate subsection, § 1026.35(c)(2). As discussed, the general term HPML applies also to loans covered by the revised escrow rules in § 1026.35(b), with exemptions specific to those rules enumerated separately in § 1026.35(b)(2).</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>Thus, exemptions that are the same in both the escrow rules in § 1026.35(b) and the appraisal rules in § 1026.35(c) are stated separately in the “exemptions” sections for each set of rules. See § 1026.35(b)(2) and (c)(2). The following exemptions are generally the same for both the HPML escrow rules and the HPML appraisal rules: new construction loans, bridge loans, and reverse mortgages. The intent of this structure is to make clear that the Agencies jointly have authority to exempt transactions from the appraisal rules, whereas only the Bureau has authority to exempt transactions from the escrow rules.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>These exemptions and related public comments are discussed in detail below.</analysisParagraph>

    <title>35(c)(4)(i)(A) and (B)</title>
    <analysisParagraph>TILA section 129H(b)(2)(A) provides that an additional appraisal is required when the price at which the seller had purchased or acquired the property was “lower” than the current sale price and the resale occurs within 180 days of the seller's acquisition. 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(2)(A). TILA does not define the term “lower.” Thus, as written, the statute would require an additional appraisal for any price increase above the seller's acquisition price, if the resale occurred within 180 days of the seller's acquisition. As discussed in more detail below, the Agencies do not believe that the public interest or the safety and soundness of creditors would be served if the law is implemented to require an additional appraisal for any increase in price. Accordingly, the Agencies proposed an exemption to the additional appraisal requirement for some threshold increase in the price. As described above, the proposal contained a placeholder for the amount by which the resale price would have to have exceeded the price at which the seller had acquired the property.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>In § 1026.35(c)(4)(i)(A) and (B), the Agencies are adopting a tiered approach to the proposed exemption for certain price increases. Specifically:</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>• Section 1026.35(c)(4)(i)(A) exempts from the additional appraisal requirement HPMLs that finance the consumer's purchase of a property within 90 days of the seller's acquisition of the property at a price that does not exceed 10 percent of the seller's acquisition purchase price.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>• Section 1026.35(c)(4)(i)(B), exempts from the additional appraisal requirement HPMLs that finance the consumer's purchase of a property within 91 to 180 days of the seller's acquisition of the property at a price that does not exceed 20 percent of the seller's acquisition price.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisSection>
      <title>Public Comments on the Proposal</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies solicited comment on potential exemptions for mortgage transactions that have a sale price that exceeds the seller's purchase price by a relatively small amount or by a certain percentage. The Agencies requested comment on whether a fixed dollar amount, a fixed percentage, or some alternate approach should be used to determine an exempt price increase, and what specific price threshold would be appropriate.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies received a large number of comments on these questions. The commenters generally endorsed the proposed exemption, based either on a dollar amount, or a percentage of the seller's acquisition price. Four commenters (a bank holding company, two national trade associations for mortgage lending companies and consumer and small-business lenders, and a large mortgage lending company) suggested that a 10 percent price increase exception would be appropriate. One of these commenters argued that 10 percent is a customary standard in the industry because it represents typical realtor and other closing costs.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>A national trade association for community banks suggested a minimum of 15 percent. Two commenters, a regional trade association for credit unions and a community bank, argued that the exception should be at least 25 percent. One large national bank suggested a threshold of 5 percent. Another commenter, a credit union, suggested that an exemption be for the greater of three percent or a $10,000 increase in the price. A GSE suggested that the Agencies exempt from the second appraisal requirement sales that are subject to an “anti-flipping” clause. When an investor purchases a property in short sales from the GSEs, for example, certain clauses in the sales contract prohibit the investor from reselling that property for the first 30 days after the short sale purchase. The investor is then prohibited from reselling the property without justification and permission from the GSE for the next 31 to 90 days for a price that exceeds the seller's price by more than 20 percent.<footnote ref="55">See Fannie Mae Single Family Servicing Guide Announcement SVC 2012-19, page 13; and Freddie Mac Single Family Seller Servicer Guide, Chapter B65.40(i).</footnote>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <analysisParagraph>As noted, the Agencies are adopting a tiered approach to the proposed exemption from the additional appraisal requirement of TILA section § 1026.35(c)(4)(i) for HPMLs that finance the resale of properties that do not exceed certain price increases from the prior sale. Specifically, § 1026.35(c)(4)(i)(A) exempts from the additional appraisal requirement HPMLs that finance the consumer's purchase of a property within 90 days of the seller's acquisition of the property where the resale price does not exceed 10 percent of the seller's acquisition price. Section 1026.35(c)(4)(i)(B), exempts from the additional appraisal requirement HPMLs that finance the consumer's purchase of a property within 91 to 180 days of the seller's acquisition of the property where the resale price does not exceed 20 percent of the seller's acquisition price. In developing this approach, the Agencies reviewed public comments as well as other government standards and rules designed to curb harmful flipping in residential mortgage transactions. These included short sale reselling restrictions imposed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the U.S. Treasury Department,<footnote ref="57">See Fannie Mae Single Family Servicing Guide Announcement SVC 2012-19, page 13; and Freddie Mac Single Family Seller Servicer Guide, Chapter B65.40(i); U.S. Dept. of Treasury, Supplemental Directive 12-07 (Nov. 1, 2012).</footnote>
        as well as HUD's Anti-Flipping Rules—both HUD's existing regulations (24 CFR 203.37a(b)) and HUD rules currently in effect that temporarily “waive” existing regulations and replace them with other standards.<footnote ref="58">See, e.g., 77 FR 71099 (Nov. 29, 2012).</footnote>
      </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies believe that short sale reselling restrictions of the GSEs and Treasury are instructive. Like these rules, the final rule incorporates a bifurcated approach to addressing fraudulent flipping, based on the number of days between the seller's purchase and the consumer's purchase.<footnote ref="59">As noted earlier, the GSE and Treasury short sale rules ban resales outright for 30 days after the short sale and also ban them if the sales price increases by more than 20 percent for resales in the next 31 to 90 days. See Fannie Mae Single Family Servicing Guide Announcement SVC 2012-19, page 13; and Freddie Mac Single Family Seller Servicer Guide, Chapter B65.40(i); U.S. Dept. of Treasury, Supplemental Directive 12-07 (Nov. 1, 2012).</footnote>
        The Agencies are not adopting an exemption for HPMLs financing sales subject to an anti-flipping clause, however. The Agencies are concerned that such an exemption would not be sufficiently protective of the HPML consumers the statute was intended to protect. If such an exemption covered only loans subject to GSE and Treasury anti-flipping clauses, HPML consumers purchasing homes from investors who acquired them from GSEs or Treasury would not receive the protection of the additional appraisal requirement. Meanwhile, HPML consumers purchasing homes from investors who acquired them from other creditors or investors would receive the protection of the additional appraisal requirement. It is unclear why HPML consumers in the latter case should receive these protections and consumers in the former case should not. In addition, the purpose of the additional appraisal requirement in the final rule is to ensure a second opinion on the value of a purchased home; the purpose of anti-flipping clauses generally is to restrict the transaction entirely. Thus, these clauses may be instructive, but should not necessarily determine who receives the protection of this rule.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>If an exemption for HPMLs financing sales subject to an anti-flipping clause covered loans subject to anti-flipping clauses more generally, the Agencies would be concerned about more HPML consumers not receiving the protections of the statute. Moreover, if creditors were concerned that the additional appraisal requirement might impede disposal of their distressed properties, they could devise “anti-flipping” clauses that would impose only minimal restrictions on the resale of those properties, simply to take advantage of the exemption. The Agencies recognize the importance to creditors and investors of being able to sell distressed properties in a timely manner to decrease losses. The Agencies further understand that restrictions on the resale of distressed properties purchased from creditors and investors can affect how quickly creditors and investors can dispose of these properties, and that creditors and investors design resale restrictions accordingly. However, the appraisal requirement under this final rule is not a restriction on resale by the seller; it is a requirement for additional documentation regarding the value of homes purchased by a certain subset of consumers who finance the transaction with an HPML.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies view the FHA Anti-Flipping Rules as also instructive for the final rule. In the preamble to its original Anti-Flipping Final Rule and waiver notices after it, HUD states that “fraudulent property flipping involves the rapid re-sale, often within days, of a recently acquired property.”<footnote ref="60">See, e.g., 68 FR 23370 (May 1, 2003); 77 FR 71099 (Nov. 29, 2012).</footnote>
        HUD also states in its original final rule that “resales executed within 90 days imply pre-arranged transactions that often prove to be among the most egregious examples of predatory lending.”<footnote ref="61">68 FR 23370, 23372 (May 1, 2003).</footnote>
        Thus, under existing HUD regulations, FHA insurance is not available for loans that finance the purchase of a property within 90 days of the previous sale. See 24 CFR 203.37a(b)(2). HUD's rule is based on the conclusion that 90 days is a reasonable waiting period to ensure that legitimate rehabilitation and repairs of a property have occurred.<footnote ref="62">See id.</footnote>
      </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>HUD has also stated that a 180-day ban on eligibility for FHA insurance would have provided a disincentive to legitimate contractors who improve houses—thus increasing the stock of affordable housing.<footnote ref="63">See id.</footnote>
        Therefore, for transactions involving resales in the 91-180 day period, HUD will insure resales at any price, but requires additional documentation, which must include a second appraisal, if the price increase exceeds the seller's acquisition price by 100 percent. See 24 CFR 203.37a(b)(3).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies believe that HUD's basic approach—the use of more restrictive conditions for 90 days, followed by somewhat lesser restrictions for the next 90 days—has merit as an approach to combatting the kind of flipping with which Congress seemed concerned.<footnote ref="64">See U.S. House of Reps., Comm. on Fin. Servs., Report on H.R. 1728, Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act, No. 111-94, 59 (May 4, 2009) (House Report); Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2010 Mortgage Fraud Report Year in Review 18 (August 2011), available at http://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/mortgage-fraud-2010/mortgage-fraud-report-2010. See also 71 FR 33138, 33141-33142 (June 7, 2006); HUD, Mortgagee Letter 2006-14 (June 8, 2006) (“FHA's policy prohibiting property flipping eliminates the most egregious examples of predatory flips of properties within the FHA mortgage insurance programs.”).</footnote>
        The Agencies recognize that, since issuing the regulation in 24 CFR 203.37a(b)(3), HUD has issued rules that temporarily replace its existing regulations, with the goal of encouraging investors to rehabilitate homes and thus help “stabilize real estate prices as well as neighborhoods and communities where foreclosure activity has been high.”<footnote ref="65">77 FR 71099 (Nov. 29, 2012).</footnote>
        Under these temporary rules, FHA insurance is now available for loans that finance property resales within 90 days of the previous sale, as long as certain conditions are met. One condition is that “a second appraisal and/or supporting documentation” is required if the sales price exceeds the seller's acquisition price by more than 20 percent.<footnote ref="66">See id. at 71100. A property inspection is also required. See id. at 71100-71101. &lt;em data-original="E-03"/&gt;For loans financing resales within 90 days where the sales price does not exceed the seller's acquisition price by more than 20 percent, FHA insurance is conditioned on the transactions being “arms-length, with no identity of interest between the buyer and seller or other parties participating in the sales transaction.” Id. at 71100. HUD provides several examples of ways that lenders can ensure that there is no inappropriate collusion or agreement between parties. Id.</footnote>
        However, the Agencies recognize that these rules are designed to address a temporary market condition; the Agencies believe that the HPML appraisal rules must be designed to address property flipping beyond a temporary market condition.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>At the same time, the Agencies believe that the approach adopted with respect to the additional appraisal requirement resembles the FHA waiver rules in some important ways that mitigate concerns about chilling investment. Like the FHA waiver rules, the final rule does not prohibit HPML financing of resales within 90 days (by contrast, the existing FHA regulations ban FHA insurance on resales within 90 days). Rather, the final rule imposes an additional condition on the transaction—namely, that the creditor must obtain a second appraisal for the creditor's use in considering the loan application and, more specifically, the collateral value of the dwelling that will secure the mortgage. The Agencies believe that this protection is consistent with congressional intent to provide additional protections for borrowers of loans considered by Congress to pose higher risks to those borrowers. Consistent with the views expressed by some commenters, however, the Agencies have determined that consumer protection is not served by requiring a second appraisal in circumstances where the increase generally is not indicative of a seller attempting to profit on a flip. The Agencies believe it is reasonable to expect a seller, faced with circumstances dictating resale of a dwelling that the seller very recently acquired, to seek to recoup the seller's transaction costs on the purchase and resale, in addition to the seller's acquisition price. These costs may include fees from the seller's acquisition, such as mortgage application fees, origination points, escrow and attorney's fees, transfer taxes and recording fees, title search charges and title insurance premiums, as well as fees incurred in the resale, such as real estate commissions, seller-paid points, and other sales concessions on the resale. These costs will vary to some extent by State and by transaction. However, the Agencies believe that providing an allowance of 10 percent over the seller's acquisition price reasonably accommodates these transaction costs and strikes an appropriate balance with respect to ease of administration for purposes of the rule.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Regarding HPMLs that occur within 91 to 180 days, the final rule provides that an additional appraisal is required only if the property price increased by more than 20 percent of the seller's acquisition price. See § 1026.35(c)(4)(i)(B). In this way, the final rule provides a modest additional 10 percent allowance for legitimate repairs, and builds in a 90-day period in the interest of ensuring enough time to allow such repairs to be made. At the same time, the approach preserves added consumer protections in the first 90 days, when predatory flipping is most likely to occur. The Agencies recognize that this element of the final rule differs from the FHA Anti-Flipping Rules, which require additional documentation for a resale from 91 to 180 days only if the price increases by 100 percent of the seller's acquisition price. However, FHA insurance applies to HPMLs and non-HPMLs alike, and the Agencies believe that Congress intended special protections to apply to HPML consumers.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies believe that requiring an additional appraisal for HPMLs financing the purchase of a home being resold within a 180-day period, regardless of the amount of the price increase, could restrict home sales to HPML consumers, because investors might be less likely to sell properties to them. The additional appraisal rules could potentially affect the safety and soundness of creditors holding properties as a result of foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. This might arise if potential application of the two-appraisal requirement makes the properties less desirable for investors to purchase from financial institutions and rehabilitate for resale, out of investor concerns about the potential scope of the HPML requirement as applied to the pool of likely purchasers for their investment properties. This could create additional losses for creditors holding these properties. The Agencies do not believe that these potential negative impacts would be outweighed by consumer protections afforded by the additional appraisal requirement. The Agencies believe that the approach adopted by the final rule strikes the appropriate balance between allowing legitimate resales without undue restrictions and providing HPML consumers with additional protections from fraudulent flipping. For these reasons, the Agencies have concluded that the exemptions from the additional appraisal requirement reflected in § 1026.35(c)(4)(i)(A) and (B) are in the public interest and promote the safety and soundness of creditors.</analysisParagraph>

        Thus, under existing HUD regulations, FHA insurance is not available for loans that finance the purchase of a property within 90 days of the previous sale. See 24 CFR 203.37a(b)(2). HUD's rule is based on the conclusion that 90 days is a reasonable waiting period to ensure that legitimate rehabilitation and repairs of a property have occurred.<footnote ref="62">See id.</footnote>
      </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>HUD has also stated that a 180-day ban on eligibility for FHA insurance would have provided a disincentive to legitimate contractors who improve houses—thus increasing the stock of affordable housing.<footnote ref="63">See id.</footnote>
        Therefore, for transactions involving resales in the 91-180 day period, HUD will insure resales at any price, but requires additional documentation, which must include a second appraisal, if the price increase exceeds the seller's acquisition price by 100 percent. See 24 CFR 203.37a(b)(3).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies believe that HUD's basic approach—the use of more restrictive conditions for 90 days, followed by somewhat lesser restrictions for the next 90 days—has merit as an approach to combatting the kind of flipping with which Congress seemed concerned.<footnote ref="64">See U.S. House of Reps., Comm. on Fin. Servs., Report on H.R. 1728, Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act, No. 111-94, 59 (May 4, 2009) (House Report); Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2010 Mortgage Fraud Report Year in Review 18 (August 2011), available at http://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/mortgage-fraud-2010/mortgage-fraud-report-2010. See also 71 FR 33138, 33141-33142 (June 7, 2006); HUD, Mortgagee Letter 2006-14 (June 8, 2006) (“FHA's policy prohibiting property flipping eliminates the most egregious examples of predatory flips of properties within the FHA mortgage insurance programs.”).</footnote>
        The Agencies recognize that, since issuing the regulation in 24 CFR 203.37a(b)(3), HUD has issued rules that temporarily replace its existing regulations, with the goal of encouraging investors to rehabilitate homes and thus help “stabilize real estate prices as well as neighborhoods and communities where foreclosure activity has been high.”<footnote ref="65">77 FR 71099 (Nov. 29, 2012).</footnote>
        Under these temporary rules, FHA insurance is now available for loans that finance property resales within 90 days of the previous sale, as long as certain conditions are met. One condition is that “a second appraisal and/or supporting documentation” is required if the sales price exceeds the seller's acquisition price by more than 20 percent.<footnote ref="66">See id. at 71100. A property inspection is also required. See id. at 71100-71101. &lt;em data-original="E-03"/&gt;For loans financing resales within 90 days where the sales price does not exceed the seller's acquisition price by more than 20 percent, FHA insurance is conditioned on the transactions being “arms-length, with no identity of interest between the buyer and seller or other parties participating in the sales transaction.” Id. at 71100. HUD provides several examples of ways that lenders can ensure that there is no inappropriate collusion or agreement between parties. Id.</footnote>
        However, the Agencies recognize that these rules are designed to address a temporary market condition; the Agencies believe that the HPML appraisal rules must be designed to address property flipping beyond a temporary market condition.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>At the same time, the Agencies believe that the approach adopted with respect to the additional appraisal requirement resembles the FHA waiver rules in some important ways that mitigate concerns about chilling investment. Like the FHA waiver rules, the final rule does not prohibit HPML financing of resales within 90 days (by contrast, the existing FHA regulations ban FHA insurance on resales within 90 days). Rather, the final rule imposes an additional condition on the transaction—namely, that the creditor must obtain a second appraisal for the creditor's use in considering the loan application and, more specifically, the collateral value of the dwelling that will secure the mortgage. The Agencies believe that this protection is consistent with congressional intent to provide additional protections for borrowers of loans considered by Congress to pose higher risks to those borrowers. Consistent with the views expressed by some commenters, however, the Agencies have determined that consumer protection is not served by requiring a second appraisal in circumstances where the increase generally is not indicative of a seller attempting to profit on a flip. The Agencies believe it is reasonable to expect a seller, faced with circumstances dictating resale of a dwelling that the seller very recently acquired, to seek to recoup the seller's transaction costs on the purchase and resale, in addition to the seller's acquisition price. These costs may include fees from the seller's acquisition, such as mortgage application fees, origination points, escrow and attorney's fees, transfer taxes and recording fees, title search charges and title insurance premiums, as well as fees incurred in the resale, such as real estate commissions, seller-paid points, and other sales concessions on the resale. These costs will vary to some extent by State and by transaction. However, the Agencies believe that providing an allowance of 10 percent over the seller's acquisition price reasonably accommodates these transaction costs and strikes an appropriate balance with respect to ease of administration for purposes of the rule.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Regarding HPMLs that occur within 91 to 180 days, the final rule provides that an additional appraisal is required only if the property price increased by more than 20 percent of the seller's acquisition price. See § 1026.35(c)(4)(i)(B). In this way, the final rule provides a modest additional 10 percent allowance for legitimate repairs, and builds in a 90-day period in the interest of ensuring enough time to allow such repairs to be made. At the same time, the approach preserves added consumer protections in the first 90 days, when predatory flipping is most likely to occur. The Agencies recognize that this element of the final rule differs from the FHA Anti-Flipping Rules, which require additional documentation for a resale from 91 to 180 days only if the price increases by 100 percent of the seller's acquisition price. However, FHA insurance applies to HPMLs and non-HPMLs alike, and the Agencies believe that Congress intended special protections to apply to HPML consumers.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies believe that requiring an additional appraisal for HPMLs financing the purchase of a home being resold within a 180-day period, regardless of the amount of the price increase, could restrict home sales to HPML consumers, because investors might be less likely to sell properties to them. The additional appraisal rules could potentially affect the safety and soundness of creditors holding properties as a result of foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. This might arise if potential application of the two-appraisal requirement makes the properties less desirable for investors to purchase from financial institutions and rehabilitate for resale, out of investor concerns about the potential scope of the HPML requirement as applied to the pool of likely purchasers for their investment properties. This could create additional losses for creditors holding these properties. The Agencies do not believe that these potential negative impacts would be outweighed by consumer protections afforded by the additional appraisal requirement. The Agencies believe that the approach adopted by the final rule strikes the appropriate balance between allowing legitimate resales without undue restrictions and providing HPML consumers with additional protections from fraudulent flipping. For these reasons, the Agencies have concluded that the exemptions from the additional appraisal requirement reflected in § 1026.35(c)(4)(i)(A) and (B) are in the public interest and promote the safety and soundness of creditors.</analysisParagraph>

    <title>35(c)(4)(ii) Different Certified or Licensed Appraisers</title>
    <analysisParagraph>Under the proposed rule, the two appraisals required under the proposed paragraph now adopted as § 1026.35(c)(4)(i) could not be performed by the same certified or licensed appraiser. This proposal was consistent with TILA section 129H(b)(2)(A), which expressly requires that the additional appraisal must be performed by a “different” certified or licensed appraiser than the appraiser who performed the other appraisal for the “higher-risk mortgage” transaction. 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(2)(A).</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the proposal, during informal outreach conducted by the Agencies, some participants suggested that the Agencies impose additional requirements regarding the appraiser performing the second appraisal for the higher-risk mortgage loan, such as a requirement that the second appraiser not have knowledge of the first appraisal. Outreach participants indicated that this requirement would minimize undue pressure to value the property at a price similar to the value assigned by the first appraiser.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>The Agencies explained that they did not propose any additional conditions on what it means to obtain an appraisal from a “different” certified or licensed appraiser because the Agencies expect that existing valuation independence requirements would be sufficient to ensure that the second appraiser performs an independent valuation. Rules to ensure that appraisers exercise their independent judgment in conducting appraisals exist under TILA (§ 1026.42), as well as FIRREA title XI.<footnote ref="67">See OCC: 12 CFR 34.45; Board: 12 CFR 225.65; FDIC: 12 CFR 323.5; NCUA: 12 CFR 722.5.</footnote>
      In addition, the USPAP Ethics Rule requires that appraisers “perform assignments with impartiality, objectivity, and independence, and without accommodation of personal interests,” and includes several examples of forbidden conduct related to this rule.<footnote ref="68">Appraisal Standards Board, Appraisal Foundation, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, 2012-2013 Ed., pp. U-7 through U-9.</footnote>
      However, the Agencies requested comment on whether the rule should include additional conditions on what it means for the additional appraisal to be performed by a “different” appraiser. Specifically, the Agencies sought comment on whether the final rule should prohibit creditors from obtaining two appraisals by appraisers employed by the same appraisal firm, or who received the assignments from same appraisal management company (AMC).</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>The final rule follows the proposal and the statute in requiring that the additional appraisal must be performed by a “different” certified or licensed appraiser than the appraiser who performed the other appraisal for the HPML transaction. See § 1026.35(c)(4)(ii). In the final rule, the Agencies also adopt a new comment clarifying what it means to obtain an appraisal from a “different” certified or licensed appraiser, discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisSection>
      <title>Public Comments on the Proposal</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies received approximately 36 comments relating to requirements that (1) the additional appraisal be performed by a “different” certified or licensed appraiser, discussed immediately below; (2) the additional appraisal include analysis of the sales price differences between the prior and current home sale transaction (see section-by-section analysis of § 1026.35(c)(4)(iv), below); and (3) the creditor may not charge the consumer for the additional appraisal (see section-by-section analysis of § 1026.35(c)(4)(v), below). These comments were submitted by banks and bank holding companies, credit unions, bank and credit union trade associations, and appraisal, realtor, and mortgage industry trade associations.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Of the commenters addressing the requests for comment on whether additional conditions should apply regarding the requirement that a “different” appraiser perform the additional appraisal, most urged that the rule allow a creditor to obtain two appraisals from the same appraisal firm or AMC, provided that they are performed by separate appraisers. Commenters favoring this approach suggested that allowing a creditor to use a single appraisal firm or AMC would reduce costs, ease compliance burdens, and mitigate concerns regarding the availability of appraisers, particularly in rural or sparsely populated areas. Several commenters noted that the use of a single appraisal firm or AMC would not weaken the different appraiser requirement since each appraisal is subject to USPAP and appraisal independence requirements. One commenter, however, stated the rule should prohibit a creditor from hiring appraisers from the same valuation firm and, with respect to AMCs, a creditor should be prohibited from hiring two appraisers through the same AMC if the AMC is an affiliate of the creditor.</analysisParagraph>
    </analysisSection>
    <analysisSection>
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Consistent with the proposal, new § 1026.35(c)(4)(ii) provides that the two appraisals required under § 1026.35(c)(4)(i) may not be performed by the same certified or licensed appraiser. The Agencies are also adopting new comment 35(c)(4)(ii)-1, clarifying that the requirements that a creditor obtain two separate appraisals (§ 1026.35(c)(4)(i)), and that each appraisal be conducted by a “different” licensed or certified appraiser (§ 1026.35(c)(4)(ii)), indicate that the two appraisals must be conducted independently of each other. The comment explains that, if the two certified or licensed appraisers are affiliated, such as by being employed by the same appraisal firm, then whether they have conducted the appraisal independently of each other must be determined based on the facts and circumstances of the particular case known to the creditor.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the proposal, the Agencies believe that the appraisal independence requirements of TILA (implemented at § 1026.42) help ensure that the two appraisals reflect valuation judgments that are independent of the creditor's loan origination interests and not biased by an appraiser's personal or business interest in the property or the transaction. TILA section 129E, 15 U.S.C. 1639e. In addition, FIRREA title XI includes rules to ensure that appraisers exercise their independent judgment in conducting appraisals, such as requirements that federally-regulated depositories separate appraisers from the lending, investment, and collection functions of the institution, and that the appraiser have “no direct or indirect interest, financial or otherwise, in the property.”<footnote ref="69">See OCC: 12 CFR 34.45; Board: 12 CFR 225.65; FDIC: 12 CFR 323.5; and NCUA: 12 CFR 722.5.</footnote>
        As noted, USPAP's Ethics Rule, which applies to appraisers, also requires that appraisers “perform assignments with impartiality, objectivity, and independence, and without accommodation of personal interests,” and includes several examples of prohibited conduct related to this rule.<footnote ref="70">Appraisal Standards Board, Appraisal Foundation, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, 2012-2013 Ed., pp. U-7 through U-9.</footnote>
        As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.35(c)(1)(a), compliance with USPAP is a condition of being a “certified or licensed appraiser” under TILA's “higher-risk mortgage” appraisal rules implemented in this final rule. TILA section 129H(b)(3), 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(3); § 1026.35(c)(1)(a).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Requirements for valuation independence for consumer credit transactions secured by the consumer's principal dwelling were adopted under amendments to TILA in the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010 and have been in effect since April of 2011. See 12 CFR 1026.42; 75 FR 66554 (Oct. 28, 2010), implementing TILA section 129E, 15 U.S.C. 1639e. The requirements in TILA, which carry civil liability, were designed to ensure that real estate appraisals used to support creditors' underwriting decisions are based on the appraiser's independent professional judgment, free of any influence or pressure that may be exerted by parties that have an interest in the transaction.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Existing appraisal independence requirements expressly prohibit appraisers, AMCs, or appraisal firms (all providers of settlement services) from having an interest in the property or transaction or from causing the value assigned to a consumer's principal dwelling to be based on any factor other than the independent judgment of the person preparing the appraisal. Material misstatements of the value are also prohibited for these parties, as is having a direct or indirect interest in the transaction, which prohibits these parties from being compensated based on the outcome of the transaction.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies understand that, in light of these rules, a principal reason that creditors contract with third-party AMCs and appraisal firms is to ensure that the appraisal function is independent from the loan origination function, as required by law. In addition, the creditor remains responsible for compliance with the appraisal requirements of § 1026.35(c), and both the creditor and the creditor's third party agent risk liability for violations of TILA's appraisal independence requirements.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>At the same time, the Agencies have concerns about whether the unbiased appraiser independence will always be fully realized if, for example, the two appraisals are performed by appraisers employed by the same company. The Agencies recognize that in some cases, obtaining two appraisals from different appraisal firms might not be feasible, and moreover that appraisers working for the same company are cognizant of their independence, and indeed might not even interact at all. Thus, the rule is intended to allow flexibility in ordering the two appraisals from the same entity. However, as underscored in comment 35(c)(4)(ii)-1, in all cases the two appraisers should function independently of each other to ensure that in fact two separate and independent judgments of the property value are reflected in the required appraisals. If the creditor knows of facts or circumstances about the performance of the additional appraisal by the same firm indicating that the additional appraisal was not performed independently, the creditor should refrain from extending credit, unless the creditor obtains another appraisal.</analysisParagraph>

    <title>35(c)(4)(iii) Relationship to General Appraisal Requirements</title>
    <analysisParagraph>The proposed rule required that the additional appraisal meet the requirements of the first appraisal, including the requirements that the appraisal be performed by a certified or licensed appraiser who conducts a physical visit of the interior of the mortgaged property. See new § 1026.35(c)(3)(i). The Agencies expressed in the proposal the belief that this approach best effectuates the purposes of the statute. TILA section 129H(b)(1) provides that, “[s]ubject to the rules prescribed under paragraph (4), an appraisal of property to be secured by a higher-risk mortgage does not meet the requirements of this section unless it is performed by a certified or licensed appraiser who conducts a physical property visit of the interior of the mortgaged property.” 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(1). The “second appraisal” required under TILA section 129H(b)(2)(A) is “an appraisal of property to be secured by a higher-risk mortgage” under TILA section 129H(b)(1). 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(1), (b)(2)(A). Therefore, to meet the requirements of TILA section 129H, the additional appraisal would be required to be “performed by a certified or licensed appraiser who conducts a physical visit of the interior of the property that will secure the transaction.” TILA section 129H(b)(1), 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(1).</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>In addition, under TILA section 129H(b)(2)(A), the additional appraisal must analyze several elements, including “any improvements made to the property between the date of the previous sale and the current sale.” 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(2)(A). The Agencies believe that the purposes of the statute would be best implemented by requiring the second appraiser to perform a physical interior property visit to analyze any improvements made to the property. Without an on-site visit, the second appraiser would have difficulty confirming that any improvements identified by the seller or the first appraiser were made.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>In § 1026.35(c)(4)(iii), the Agencies are adopting the proposed requirement that, if the conditions requiring an additional appraisal are present (see new § 1026.35(c)(4)(i)), the creditor must obtain an additional appraisal that meets the requirements of the first appraisal, as provided in § 1026.35(c)(3)(i). In response to some commenters who expressed confusion about whether the creditor could rely on the safe harbor under § 1026.35(c)(3)(ii) in satisfying the general appraisal requirements under § 1026.35(c)(3)(i) for the additional appraisal, the Agencies are adopting a new comment. New comment 35(c)(4)(iii)-1 clarifies that when a creditor is required to obtain an additional appraisal under § 1026(c)(4)(i), the creditor must comply with the requirements of both § 1026.35(c)(3)(i) and § 1026.35(c)(4)(ii)-(v) for that appraisal. If the creditor meets the safe harbor criteria in § 1026.35(c)(3)(ii) for the additional appraisal, the creditor complies with the requirements of § 1026.35(c)(3)(i) for that appraisal.</analysisParagraph>

    <analysisParagraph>The proposed rule required that the additional appraisal include an analysis of the difference between the price at which the seller acquired the property and the price the consumer is obligated to pay to acquire the property, as specified in the consumer's acquisition agreement. The proposal specified that the changes in market conditions and improvements made to the property must be analyzed between the date of the seller's acquisition of the property and the date of the consumer's agreement to acquire the property. These proposed requirements are consistent with the statute, which requires that the additional appraisal “include an analysis of the difference in sale prices, changes in market conditions, and any improvements made to the property between the date of the previous sale and the current sale.” TILA section 129H(b)(2)(A), 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(2)(A).</analysisParagraph>

The comment also stated that guidance on identifying the price at which the seller acquired the property could be found in the proposed comment adopted as comment 35(c)(4)(i)(B)-1 and that guidance on identifying the price the consumer is obligated to pay to acquire the property could be found in the proposed comment adopted as comment 35(c)(4)(i)(B)-2.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Public Comments on the Proposal</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Two commenters addressed this issue. Of these, one commenter fully supported the proposed requirements for the additional appraisal, noting they are consistent with USPAP. The other commenter, however, suggested that the additional appraisal should not be required to include an analysis of the sale price paid by the seller and the acquisition price as set forth in the borrower's purchase agreement and improvements made to the property by the seller. The commenter argued that value should be based solely on the current market value of the property at the time of the appraisal and sale, of which the first appraisal should be determinative.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies also requested comment on the appropriateness of using, as prices that the additional appraisal must analyze, the terms “price at which seller acquired property” and “price consumer is obligated to pay to acquire property, as specified in consumer's agreement to acquire property from seller.” Further, the Agencies asked for comment on the appropriateness of using, as the dates the additional appraisal must analyze in considering changes in market conditions and improvements to property, the terms “date seller acquired property” and “date of consumer's agreement to acquire property.” No comments were received on this issue.</analysisParagraph>
    </analysisSection>
    <analysisSection>
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <analysisParagraph>After consideration of public comments, the Agencies believe that the proposal is appropriate to adopt without substantive change, as discussed above. Regarding the comment that the additional appraisal should not include an analysis of the property price increase between the seller's price and the consumer's price, but that market value as reflected in the first appraisal should be determinative, the Agencies point out that the analysis in the additional appraisal required under new § 1026.35(c)(4)(iii) is mandated by statute. Moreover, the Agencies believe that the intent of these requirements is to ensure that creditor, in considering the value of the collateral in connection with its lending decision, is presented with information focused specifically on factors that reasonably increase collateral value in a relatively short period, such as market changes and property improvements. These statutory requirements are designed to serve as a backstop for consumers against fraud in flipped transactions and thus are implemented largely unchanged in the final rule.</analysisParagraph>

The Agencies proposed a comment clarifying that this rule means that the creditor would be prohibited from imposing a fee specifically for that appraisal or by marking up the interest rate or any other fees payable by the consumer in connection with the higher-risk mortgage loan. The proposal was designed to implement TILA section 129H(b)(2)(B), which provides that “[t]he cost of the second appraisal required under subparagraph (A) may not be charged to the applicant.” 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(2)(B).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Public Comments on the Proposal</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Most commenters were strongly opposed to requiring the additional appraisal to be obtained at the creditor's expense. While a number of commenters acknowledged that the requirement is statutorily mandated under Dodd-Frank they were nevertheless critical of it, cautioning that the requirement would ultimately limit the availability of credit to consumers. Many commenters indicated that the cost of an additional appraisal would make the loan too costly or unprofitable, leading creditors to cease offering higher-risk mortgage loans to riskier borrowers. Several commenters argued it is unfair for creditors to bear the cost responsibility of a second appraisal, where the applicant has no incentive to go forward with the loan and there is no guarantee that the loan will be consummated. Commenters urged the Agencies to exercise their exemption authority to permit creditors to charge consumers a reasonable fee for the additional appraisal. Alternatively, one comment letter recommended that creditors be prohibited from charging a direct cost for the additional appraisal but not an indirect cost.</analysisParagraph>
    </analysisSection>
    <analysisSection>
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <analysisParagraph>As noted, TILA section 129H(b)(2)(B) provides that “[t]he cost of the second appraisal required under subparagraph (A) may not be charged to the applicant.” 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(2)(B). Consistent with the statute and the proposal, § 1026.35(c)(4)(v) provides that “[i]f the creditor must obtain two appraisals under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the creditor may charge the consumer for only one of the appraisals.” As clarified in comment 35(c)(4)(v)-1, adopted without change from the proposal, the creditor would be prohibited from imposing a fee specifically for that appraisal or by marking up the interest rate or any other fees payable by the consumer in connection with the higher-risk mortgage loan (now HPML).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The proposed comment adopted in the final rule also explains that the creditor would be prohibited from charging the consumer for the “performance of one of the two appraisals required under § 1026.35(c)(4)(i).” This comment is intended to clarify that the prohibition on charging the consumer under § 1026.35(b)(4)(v) applies to the cost of providing the consumer with a copy of the appraisal, not to charges for the cost of performing the appraisal. As implemented by new § 1026.35(c)(6)(iv), TILA section 129H(c) prohibits the creditor from charging the consumer for one copy of each appraisal conducted pursuant to the higher-risk mortgage rule. 15 U.S.C. 1639h(c); see also section-by-section analysis of § 1026.35(c)(6)(iv), below. As in the proposal, the final rule does not use the statutory term “second” appraisal, but instead refers to the “additional” appraisal because, in practice, a creditor ordering two appraisals at the same time may not know which of the two appraisals would be the “second” appraisal. The Agencies understand that the additional appraisal could be separately identified because it must contain an analysis of elements in proposed § 1026.35(c)(4)(iv). The Agencies also understand that appraisers may perform such an analysis as a matter of routine, and that it may be difficult to distinguish the two appraisals on that basis.<footnote ref="71">See, e.g., USPAP Standards Rule 1-5(b) (requiring an appraiser to “analyze all sales of the subject property that occurred within the three years prior to the effective date of the appraisal”); USPAP Standards Rule 1-4(a) (stating that “an appraiser must analyze such comparable sales data as are available to indicate a value conclusion”) and USPAP Standards Rule 1-4(f) (stating that “when analyzing anticipated public or private improvements * * * an * * * appraiser must analyze the effect on value, if any, of such anticipated improvements to the extent they are reflected in market actions.”</footnote>
      </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In addition, the final rule also tracks the proposal in prohibiting the creditor from charging “the consumer,” rather than, as in the statute, the “applicant.” The Agencies believe that use of the broader term “consumer” is necessary to clarify that the creditor may not charge the consumer for the cost of the additional appraisal after consummation of the loan.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Regarding commenters' requests that creditors be permitted to charge the consumer for the additional appraisal, the Agencies point out that they do not jointly have authority to provide for adjustments and exceptions to TILA under TILA section 105(a), which belongs to the Bureau alone. 15 U.S.C. 1604(a). The prohibition on charging the consumer for the additional appraisal is mandated by statute. The Agencies have implemented this statutory prohibition with certain clarifications appropriate to carry out the statutory mandate consistently with their general authority to interpret the statute—specifically clarifying in commentary that the creditor is prohibited from imposing a fee specifically for that appraisal or by marking up the interest rate or any other fees payable by the consumer in connection with the higher-risk mortgage loan. See § 1026.35(c)(4)(v) and comment 35(c)(4)(v)-1.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies recognize that neither the statute's plain language nor the final rule precludes a creditor from spreading costs of additional appraisals over a large number of loans and products. The Agencies believe, however, that Congress clearly intended to ensure that the consumer offered an HPML, who may have limited credit options, not be exclusively affected by having to bear this cost in full. The Agencies further believe that the final rule is consistent with this statutory purpose.</analysisParagraph>

    <title>35(c)(4)(vi)(B) Inability To Determine Prior Sale Date or Price—Modified Requirements for Additional Appraisal</title>
    <analysisParagraph>Section 35(c)(4)(vi)(B) provides that if, after exercising reasonable diligence, a creditor cannot determine whether the conditions in § 1026.35(c)(4)(i)(A) and (B) are present and therefore must obtain two written appraisals under § 1026.35(c)(4), the additional appraisal must include an analysis of the factors in § 1026.35(c)(4)(iv) (difference in sales price, changes in market conditions, and property improvements) only to the extent that the information necessary for the appraiser to perform the analysis can be determined.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>For the reasons discussed above, the Agencies believe that an HPML creditor should be required to obtain an additional appraisal if the creditor cannot determine the seller's acquisition date, or if it can determine the date is within 180 days but cannot determine the price, based on written source documents. However, in keeping with the proposal, § 1026.35(c)(4)(vi)(B) also provides that the additional appraisal in this situation would not have to contain the full analysis required for additional appraisals of flipping transactions under TILA section 129H(b)(2)(A), implemented in the final rule as § 1026.35(c)(4)(iv)(A)-(C). 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(2)(A).</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisSection>
      <title>Public Comments on the Proposal</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies requested comment on whether an appraiser would be unable to analyze the difference in the price the consumer is obligated to pay to acquire the property and the price at which the seller acquired the property without knowing when the seller acquired the property. If such an analysis is not possible without information about when the seller acquired the property, the Agencies requested comment on whether the rule should assume the seller acquired the property 180 days prior to the date of the consumer's agreement to acquire the property. The Agencies also requested comment generally on the proposed approach to situations in which the creditor cannot obtain the necessary information and whether the rule should address information gaps about the flipping transaction in other ways.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies did not receive comments directly responsive to these questions.</analysisParagraph>

    <analysisSection>
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Under the proposal, now adopted in § 1026.35(c)(4)(vi)(B), the additional appraisal must include an analysis of the elements that would be required in proposed § 1026.35(c)(4)(iv)(A)-(C) only to the extent that the creditor knows the seller's purchase price and acquisition date. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.35(c)(4)(iv), TILA section 129H(b)(2)(A) requires that the additional appraisal analyze the difference in sales prices, changes in market conditions, and improvements to the property between the date of the previous sale and the current sale. 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(2)(A). An appraiser could not perform this analysis if efforts to obtain the seller's acquisition date and price were not successful.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Consistent with the proposal, comment 35(c)(4)(vi)(B)-1 confirms that, in general, the additional appraisal required under § 1026.35(c)(4)(i) should include an analysis of the factors listed in § 1026.35(c)(4)(iv)(A)-(C). However, the comment also confirms that if, following reasonable diligence, a creditor cannot determine whether the conditions in § 1026.35(c)(4)(i) are present due to a lack of information or conflicting information, the required additional appraisal must include the analyses required under § 1026.35(c)(4)(iv)(A)-(C) only to the extent that the information necessary to perform the analysis is known. As an example, comment 35(c)(4)(vi)(B)-1 assumes that a creditor is able, following reasonable diligence, to determine that the date on which the seller acquired the property occurred between 91 and 180 days prior to the date of the consumer's agreement to acquire the property, but cannot determine the sale price. In this case, the creditor is required to obtain an additional written appraisal that includes an analysis under § 1026.35(c)(4)(iv)(B) and (c)(4)(iv)(C) of the changes in market conditions and any improvements made to the property between the date the seller acquired the property and the date of the consumer's agreement to acquire the property. However, the creditor is not required to obtain an additional written appraisal that includes analysis under § 1026.35(c)(4)(iv)(A) of the difference between the price at which the seller acquired the property and the price that the consumer is obligated to pay to acquire the property.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies note that the proposed rule does not provide commentary with guidance on the modified requirements for the additional analysis in a situation in which the creditor is unable to determine the date the seller acquired the property but is able to determine the price at which the seller acquired the property. As noted, the Agencies requested but did not receive public comments on this aspect of the proposal. The Agencies are unaware of situations in which the seller's acquisition price, but not the acquisition date, would be known. In the absence of public comment on the issue, the Agencies are not adopting additional guidance on this theoretical situation.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies believe that allowing creditors to comply with a modified form of the full analysis where a creditor cannot determine information about a property based on its reasonable diligence is a reasonable interpretation of the statute. If a creditor could not determine when or for how much the prior sale occurred, it would be impossible for a creditor to obtain an appraisal that complies with the full analysis requirement of TILA section 129H(b)(2)(A) concerning the change in price, market conditions, and improvements to the property. 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(2)(A).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies' approach to situations in which the creditor cannot obtain the necessary information, either due to a lack of information or conflicting information, can be summed up as follows:</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>• An additional appraisal is required.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>• However, to account for missing or conflicting information, only a modified version of the full additional analysis required under TILA section 129H(b)(2)(A), as implemented by § 1026.35(c)(4)(iv) is required. 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(2)(A).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Alternative approaches not chosen by the Agencies include prohibiting creditors from extending the HPML altogether under these circumstances. As stated in the proposal, however, the Agencies believe that a flat prohibition would unduly limit the availability of higher-risk mortgage loans to consumers.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Acquisitions of Property From Local, State or Federal Government Agencies</title>
      <analysisParagraph>In § 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(A), the Agencies are adopting an exemption for HPMLs financing consumer acquisitions of property being sold by a local, State or Federal government agency. This exemption generally corresponds with exemptions in the FHA Anti-Flipping Rule for loans financing the purchase of an “REO” (real estate owned) property being sold by HUD or another U.S. government agency (see 12 CFR 203.37a(c)(1) and (2)) and a broad exemption for sales of properties by local and State government agencies (see 12 CFR 203.37a(c)(7)). The Agencies do not believe that purchases of properties being sold by local, State or Federal government agencies present the fraudulent flipping risks that the special “higher-risk mortgage” appraisal rules in TILA section 129H were intended to address. 15 U.S.C. 1639h.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Typically, these types of sales are in connection with government programs involving the sale of property obtained through foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, which can promote affordable housing and neighborhood revitalization. Government agency sales may also be related to foreclosures due to tax liability or related reasons. Without an exemption, most consumer acquisitions involving these types of sales would be subject to the additional appraisal requirement because the government agency typically would have “acquired” the property (for example, in a foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure) for the outstanding balance of the government's lien (plus costs), which is generally less than the value of the property; thus, the price paid to the government agency by the consumer would typically be substantially higher than the government agency's acquisition “price.” In addition, these sales might occur relatively soon after the government agency acquired the property, particularly if the acquisition resulted from a foreclosure or tax sale.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies believe that requiring an HPML creditor to obtain two appraisals to finance transactions involving the purchase of property from government agencies could interfere with beneficial government programs. The Agencies further do not believe that this interference is warranted for these transactions, which do not involve a profit-motivated seller and thus do not present the kinds of flipping concerns that the statute is intended to address. The Agencies believe that an exemption for HPMLs financing the sale of property by a local, State, or Federal government agency is in the public interest because it allows beneficial government programs to go forward as intended. By reducing costs for creditors that might offer HPMLs to finance these transactions, the exemption helps creditors to strengthen and diversify their lending portfolios, thereby promoting the safety and soundness of creditors as well.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Acquisitions of Property Obtained Through Foreclosure and Related Means</title>
      <analysisParagraph>In § 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(B), the Agencies are adopting an exemption for HPMLs financing the purchase of a property from a person that had acquired the property through foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, or other similar judicial or non-judicial procedures as a result of exercising the person's rights as a holder of a defaulted mortgage loan. This exemption generally corresponds with an exemption from the FHA Anti-Flipping Rule for loans financing the purchase of properties sold by State- and Federally-chartered financial institutions and GSEs (see 12 CFR 203.37a(c)(6)). The Agencies recognize that this exemption might overlap with the exemption in § 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(A) for sales by government agencies, which might sell properties that the agencies acquire in connection with liquidating a mortgage. However, the Agencies believe that a separate exemption for sales by government agencies is advisable because government agencies might have other reasons for acquiring a property that they then determined was advisable to sell, such as property acquired through exercise of the government's eminent domain powers.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The exemption covers HPMLs that finance the acquisition of a home from a “person” who has acquired title of the property through foreclosure and related means. “Person” is defined in Regulation Z to mean “a natural person or an organization, including a corporation, partnership, proprietorship, association, cooperative, estate, trust, or government unit.” § 1026.2(a)(22). Thus, consistent with the FHA Anti-Flipping Rule exemptions, the exemption in § 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(B) covers purchases of properties being sold by State- and Federally-chartered financial institutions, as well as by GSEs such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks. In addition, the exemption covers HPML loans financing property acquisitions from non-bank mortgage companies, servicers that administer loans held in the portfolios of financial institutions or in pools of mortgages that underlie private and government or GSE asset-backed securitizations, and, less commonly, private individuals. The Agencies believe that a more inclusive exemption for foreclosures better reflects the way that mortgage loans are held and serviced in today's market.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Several commenters pointed out that the sale of REO properties to consumers and potential investors contributes significantly to revitalizing neighborhoods and stabilizing communities. They expressed concerns that the additional appraisal requirement might unduly interfere with these sales, which could have a number of negative effects. First, holders of the mortgages might be forced to hold properties after foreclosure longer than is financially optimal, increasing losses; some public commenters indicated that waiting six months so that the additional appraisal requirement would not apply would be far too long. Second, holders who want or need to clear these properties off of their books might be forced to accept lower prices offered by investors, which would also increase losses. When the holder in this situation is a creditor such as a bank or other financial institution, increased losses can have a negative effect on its safety and soundness. Third, incentives for investors to buy and rehabilitate properties could be reduced, which could be counterproductive to community development and the revitalization of the housing market. Finally, more consumers might have to forego opportunities for homeownership.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For all of these reasons, the Agencies believe that the exemption in § 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(B) is in the public interest and promotes the safety and soundness of creditors.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Acquisitions of Property From Certain Non-Profit Entities</title>
      <analysisParagraph>In § 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(C), the Agencies are adopting an exemption for HPMLs financing the purchase of a property from a non-profit entity as part of a local, State, or Federal government program under which the non-profit entity is permitted to acquire single-family properties for resale from a seller who acquired the property through foreclosure or similar means. Comment 35(c)(4)(vii)(C)-1 clarifies that, for purposes of 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(C), a “non-profit entity” refers to a person with a tax exemption ruling or determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (12 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)).<footnote ref="80">“Person” is defined in Regulation Z as “a natural person or an organization, including a corporation, partnership, proprietorship, association, cooperative, estate, trust, or government unit.” § 1026.2(a)(22).</footnote>
        This exemption generally builds on an exemption from the FHA Anti-Flipping Rule for loans financing the purchase of properties from nonprofit organizations approved to purchase HUD REO single-family properties at a discount with resale restrictions (see 12 CFR 203.37a(c)(3)).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Consistent with the FHA Anti-Flipping Rule exemptions, the exemption in § 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(C) would cover nonprofit organizations approved to purchase HUD REO single-family properties. In addition, the exemption would cover purchases of these types of properties from nonprofit organizations as part of other local, State or Federal government programs under which the non-profit entity is permitted to acquire title to REO single family properties for resale.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For reasons similar to those discussed under the exemption for loan holders selling a property acquired through liquidating a mortgage (§ 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(B)), the Agencies believe that the exemption for HPMLs financing the acquisitions described in § 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(C) is in the public interest and promotes the safety and soundness of creditors. The exemption is intended in part to help holders such as banks and other financial institutions sell properties held as a result of foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, thereby removing them from their books. This can minimize losses, which improves institutions' safety and soundness. The exemption is also intended to facilitate neighborhood revitalization for the benefit of communities and individual consumers. Government programs involving purchases and sales of REO property by non-profits can foster positive community investment and help investors dispense with loss-generating properties efficiently and in a manner that maximizes public benefit. The Agencies do not believe that these types of sales to consumers by non-profits involve serious risks of fraudulent flipping, and thus do not believe that TILA's additional appraisal requirement was intended to apply to these transactions. For these reasons, the Agencies believe that the exemption in § 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(C) is in the public interest and promotes the safety and soundness of creditors.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Acquisitions From Persons Acquiring the Property Through Inheritance or Dissolution of Marriage, Civil Union, or Domestic Partnership</title>
      <analysisParagraph>In § 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(D), the Agencies are adopting an exemption for HPMLs financing the purchase of a property that was acquired by the seller by inheritance or pursuant to a court order of dissolution of marriage, civil union, or domestic partnership, or of partition of joint or marital assets to which the seller was a party. The exemption would include HPMLs financing the acquisition by a joint owner of the property of a residual interest in that property, if the joint owner acquired that interest by inheritance or dissolution of a marriage, civil union, or domestic partnership. This exemption generally corresponds with an exemption from the FHA Anti-Flipping Rule for purchases of properties that had been acquired by the seller by inheritance (see 12 CFR 203.37a(c)(4)). As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.35(c)(4)(i), above, an exemption for HPMLs that finance the purchase of a property acquired by the seller through a non-purchase transaction was widely supported by commenters.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In response to comments, the Agencies have decided to expand the FHA Anti-Flipping Rule exemption for loans financing the purchase of a property from a seller who had acquired it by inheritance, to include properties acquired as the result of a dissolution of a marriage, civil union, or domestic partnership. The Agencies are not aware that sales of properties so acquired have been the source of fraudulent flipping activity and note that no commenters suggested that this type of flipping occurs. In addition, the Agencies do not believe that Congress intended to cover purchases of property acquired by sellers in this manner with the “higher-risk mortgage” additional appraisal requirement. The Agencies believe that consumer protection from fraudulent flipping is aided by the requirement that the acquisition of property through dissolution of a marriage or civil union must be part of a court order, which can be easily confirmed and helps ensure that the original transfer was for legitimate purposes and not merely to defraud a subsequent purchaser.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As for the exemption for HPMLs financing the purchase of a property acquired by the seller as an inheritance, the Agencies similarly do not see the risk of fraudulent flipping that Congress intended to address occurring in these transactions. Finally, in both the case of inheritance and that of divorce or dissolution, the seller has acquired the property (or full ownership of the property) under adverse circumstances; the Agencies see no reason as a public policy matter to impose further burden on the seller attempting to sell property obtained in this manner. With respect to promoting the safety and soundness of creditors, the Agencies note that a seller attempting to sell property obtained via inheritance or dissolution of marriage may not be in a position to satisfy the mortgage obligation associated with the property. As a result, creditors could be subject to losses, which can negatively affect the safety and soundness of the creditors.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For these reasons, the Agencies believe that the exemptions in § 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(D) are in the public interest and promote the safety and soundness of creditors.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Acquisitions of Property From Employers or Relocation Agencies</title>
      <analysisParagraph>In § 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(E), the Agencies are adopting an exemption for HPMLs financing the purchase of a property from an employer or relocation agency that had acquired the property in connection with the relocation of an employee. This exemption mirrors an identical exemption from the FHA Anti-Flipping Rule. See 12 CFR 203.37a(c)(5)). As with other exemptions adopted in the final rule that correspond with similar FHA Anti-Flipping Rule exemptions, the Agencies concur with FHA's longstanding conclusion that these types of transactions do not present significant fraudulent flipping risks. Rather, the circumstances of the transaction provide evidence that the impetus for the resales stems from bona fide reasons other than the seller's efforts to profit from a flip.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies believe that these transactions benefit both employees and employers by helping to ensure that employees can relocate as needed for business reasons in an efficient manner. The Agencies also believe that the exemption can benefit HPML consumers and creditors by reducing costs otherwise associated with purchasing and extending credit to finance the purchase of these properties. In addition, due to reduced burden involved with the sale of the home, the Agencies believe the exemption will promote the purchase of homes by employers. This, in turn, promotes the safety and soundness of the employees'creditors by ensuring that the employees' mortgage obligations will be met.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Acquisitions of Property From Servicemembers With Deployment or Permanent Change of Station Orders</title>
      <analysisParagraph>In § 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(F), the Agencies are adopting an exemption from the additional appraisal requirement for HPMLs financing the purchase of a property being sold by a servicemember, as defined in 50 U.S.C. Appx. 511(1), who received a deployment or permanent change of station order after acquiring the property. This exemption is not in the FHA Anti-Flipping Rule. The exemption was suggested by some commenters in response to a request for recommendations for other appropriate exemptions, however. The Agencies believe that many of the reasons for the exemptions in the final rule based on the FHA Anti-Flipping Rule support a servicemember exemption as well. For example, as with the exemption for HPMLs financing the sale of a property by an employer or relocation agency in connection with the relocation of an employee, the exemption for HPMLs financing the sale of a property by a servicemember with permanent relocation orders facilitates the efficient transfer of servicemembers.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Without this exemption, servicemembers might have more limited options for eligible buyers. For reasons discussed earlier, some creditors might be reticent about lending to an HPML consumer in a transaction that would trigger the additional appraisal requirement. This could result in servicemembers being forced to retain mortgages that are difficult for them to afford when they must also support themselves and their families in a new living arrangement elsewhere. In turn, the positions of creditors and investors on those existing mortgages could be compromised by servicemembers not being able to meet their mortgage obligations.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies do not believe that this exemption would be used frequently.

This exemption generally corresponds to an exemption in the FHA Anti-Flipping Rule for loans financing the purchase of properties located in areas designated by the President as federal disaster areas, if HUD has announced that these transactions will not be subject to the restrictions. See 12 CFR 203.37a(c)(8).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies believe that this exemption appropriately facilitates the repair and restoration of disaster areas to the benefit of individual consumers, communities, and credit markets. The Agencies also recognize that disasters might result in some consumers being unable to meet their mortgage obligations. As a result, creditors could be subject to losses, which could negatively affect the safety and soundness of the creditors. The Agencies believe that this exemption would help creditors extend HPMLs that finance the purchase of properties in disaster areas without undue burden, thus enabling the creditors to improve their lending positions more effectively.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As noted, the Agencies specified that the exemption would take effect only if and for as long as the Federal financial institutions regulatory agencies also waive application of the FIRREA title XI appraisal rules for properties in the disaster area.

      <title>Acquisitions of Properties in Rural Counties</title>
      <analysisParagraph>In § 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(H), the Agencies are adopting an exemption from the additional appraisal requirement for HPMLs that finance the purchase of a property in a “rural” county, as defined in § 1026.35(b)(iv)(A), which is a county assigned one of the following Urban Influence Codes (UICs), established by the United States Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Services (USDA-ERS): 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12. These UICs correspond to areas outside of MSAs as well as most micropolitan statistical areas; the definition would also include properties located in micropolitan statistical areas that are not adjacent to an MSA. This rural county exemption is not an exemption in the FHA Anti-Flipping Rule. However, the Agencies received requests to consider an exemption for loans in rural areas during informal outreach for the proposal, as well as from public commenters.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In the proposal, the Agencies did not propose an exemption for loans secured by properties in “rural” areas from all of the Dodd-Frank Act “higher-risk mortgage” appraisal rules, but requested comment on an exemption for these loans from the additional appraisal requirement. As discussed earlier, commenters widely supported an exemption for loans secured by properties in rural areas, citing several reasons: a lack of appraisers; the disproportionate cost of an extra appraisal, based on commenters' view that property values tend to be lower in rural areas than in non-rural areas; the assertion that many lenders in rural areas hold the loans in portfolio and therefore are more mindful of ensuring that properties securing their loans are valued properly; the assertion that lenders in rural areas tend to need to price loans higher for legitimate reasons, so a disproportionate amount of their loans (compared to those of larger lenders) will be subject to the appraisal rules and thus these lenders will bear an unfair burden that they are less equipped than larger lenders to bear; and the assertion that property flipping is rare in rural areas.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The analysis in the proposal of the impact of the proposed rule in rural areas corroborated commenters' concern that a larger share of loans in rural areas tend to be HPMLs than in non-rural areas.<footnote ref="81">In the proposal, “rural” was defined as a loan made outside of a micropolitan or metropolitan statistical area. See 77 FR 54722, 54752 n. 108 (Sept. 5, 2012).</footnote>
        Although many small and rural lenders are excluded from HMDA reporting, tabulations of rural loans by HMDA reporters may be informative about patterns of rural HPML usage. As conveyed in the proposal, 10 percent of rural first-lien purchase-money loans were HPMLs in 2010 compared to 3 percent of non-rural first-lien purchase loans.<footnote ref="82">77 FR 54722, 54752 (Sept. 5, 2012). Similar percentages for rural and non-rural first-lien purchase HPML lending are reflected in 2011 HMDA data. See Robert B. Avery, Neil Bhutta, Kenneth B. Brevoort, and Glenn Canner, “The Mortgage Market in 2011: Highlights from the Data Reported under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act,” FR Bulletin, Vol. 98, no. 6 (Dec. 2012) http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2012/PDF/2011_HMDA.pdf.</footnote>
        Based on this information, the Bureau concluded that rural borrowers may be more likely to incur the cost of an additional appraisal requirement than non-rural consumers.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Regarding appraiser availability, analysis conducted for the proposal indicated that more than two appraisers are located in all but 22 counties nationwide (13 of which are in Alaska).<footnote ref="83">See 77 FR 54722, 54752-54753 (Sept. 5, 2012).</footnote>
        An appraiser was considered “located” in a county if the appraiser's home or business address listed on the Appraisal Subcommittee's National Appraiser Registry was in that county. Public commenters pointed out, however, that while many rural areas might have more than two appraisers, these few appraisers are often busy and not readily available. One reason may be that many rural counties cover large areas, perhaps making it more difficult to arrange timely appraisals in such areas. As noted, a financial holding company suggested that the final rule exempt lenders located in areas where the State appraiser licensing or certification roster shows five or fewer unaffiliated appraisers within a reasonable distance, such as 50 miles or less. A large bank further recommended that the final rule exempt loans secured by properties in low-density appraiser markets, such as states with fewer than 500 appraisers or counties with fewer than five appraisers. The final rule does not adopt an exemption based on the number of appraisers within a particular geographic area or radius of the property securing the HPML. The Agencies believe that a simpler approach is consistent with the objectives of the statute, facilitates compliance, and reduces burden on creditors.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Other than the commenters who suggested a “radius” or low-density approach for the rural exemption, only one other commenter offered suggestions on how to define rural. This commenter recommended that the Agencies adopt a definition of “rural” that is consistent with the definition used in rules addressing the use of escrow accounts. See 2013 Escrows Final Rule, § 1026.35(b)(2)(iv); see also 2013 ATR Final Rule, § 1026.43(f)(2)(vi) and comment 43(f)(2)(vi-1). The Agencies specifically requested comment on whether the definition of “rural” used in any exemption adopted should be the same as the definition in the 2011 ATR Proposal and 2011 Escrows Proposal. These exemptions are described below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>2011 Escrows Proposal. Since 2010, Regulation Z, implementing TILA, has required creditors to establish escrow accounts for taxes and insurance on HPMLs. See 12 CFR 1026.35(b)(3). The Dodd-Frank Act subsequently amended TILA to codify and augment the escrow requirements in Regulation Z. See Dodd-Frank Act §§ 1461 and 1462, adding 15 U.S.C. 1639d. The Board issued the 2011 Escrows Proposal to implement a number of these provisions.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Among other amendments, one new section of TILA authorizes the Board (now, the Bureau) to create an exemption from the requirement to establish escrow accounts for transactions originated by creditors meeting certain criteria, including that the creditor “operates predominantly in rural or underserved areas.” 15 U.S.C. 1639d(c).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, the 2011 Escrows Proposal proposed to create an exemption for any loan extended by a creditor that makes most of its first-lien HPMLs in counties designated by the Board as “rural or underserved,” has annual originations of 100 or fewer first-lien mortgage loans, and does not escrow for any mortgage transaction it services.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Definition of “Rural”</title>
      <analysisParagraph>In the 2011 Escrows Proposal, the Board proposed to define “area” as “county” and to provide that a county would be designated as “rural” during a calendar year if:</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>* * * it is not in a metropolitan statistical area or a micropolitan statistical area, as those terms are defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, and either (1) it is not adjacent to any metropolitan or micropolitan area; or (2) it is adjacent to a metropolitan area with fewer than one million residents or adjacent to a micropolitan area, and it contains no town with 2,500 or more residents.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>See 76 FR 11598, 11610-13 (March 2, 2011); proposed 12 CFR 1026.45(b)(2)(iv)(A).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Further, the Board proposed to clarify in Official Staff Commentary to this provision that, on an annual basis, the Board would “determine[] whether each county is `rural' by reference to the currently applicable Urban Influence Codes (UICs), established by the United States Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service (USDA-ERS). Specifically the Board classifies a county as “rural” if the USDA-ERS categorizes the county under UIC 7, 10, 11, or 12.” See proposed comment 45(b)(2)(iv)-1.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Board explained its proposed definition of “rural” in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION to the proposal as follows:</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Board is proposing to limit the definition of “rural” areas to those areas most likely to have only limited sources of mortgage credit. The test for “rural” in proposed § 226.45(b)(2)(iv)(A), described above, is based on the “urban influence codes” numbered 7, 10, 11, and 12, maintained by the Economic Research Service (ERS) of the United States Department of Agriculture. The ERS devised the urban influence codes to reflect such factors as counties' relative population sizes, degrees of “urbanization,” access to larger communities, and commuting patterns. The four codes captured in the proposed “rural” definition represent the most remote rural areas, where ready access to the resources of larger, more urban communities and mobility are most limited. Proposed comment 45(b)(2)(iv)-1 would state that the Board classifies a county as “rural” if it is categorized under ERS urban influence code 7, 10, 11, or 12.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Id. at 11612.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>2011 ATR Proposal. The Dodd-Frank Act also amended TILA to impose new requirements that creditors consider a consumer's ability to repay a mortgage loan secured by the consumer's principal dwelling. See Dodd-Frank Act section 1411, adding 15 U.S.C. 1639c. As part of these amendments, the Dodd-Frank Act created a new class of loans called “qualified mortgages” and provided that creditors making qualified mortgages would be presumed to have met the new ability to repay requirements. See id. section 1412. Under the Act, balloon mortgages can be considered qualified mortgages if they meet certain criteria, including that the creditor “operates predominantly in rural or underserved areas.” Id.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In May 2011, the Board issued the 2011 ATR Proposal to implement these provisions.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In the ATR Proposal, the Board's proposed definition of “rural” and accompanying explanation in the Official Staff Commentary and SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION are identical to the definition and explanation quoted above in the 2011 Escrows Proposal. See 76 FR 27390, 27469-72 (May 11, 2011); proposed § 1026.43(f)(2)(i) and comment 43(f)(2)-1.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail in the 2013 ATR Final Rule and 2013 Escrows Final Rule, most commenters on the proposals for those rulemakings objected to this definition of “rural” as too narrow (it covers approximately 2 percent of the U.S. population). The narrow scope of the definition of “rural” was viewed as especially onerous because the scope was narrowed even further by a number of additional conditions on the exemption imposed by the statute.<footnote ref="84">For the exemption from the escrow requirement, the statute states that the Board (now, the Bureau) may exempt a creditor that: “(1) Operates predominantly in rural or underserved areas; (2) together with all affiliates, has total annual mortgage loan originations that do not exceed a limit set by the [Bureau]; (3) retains its mortgage loan originations in portfolio; and (4) meets any asset size threshold and any other criteria the [Bureau] may establish . * * *” TILA section 129D(c), 15 U.S.C. 1639d(c); see also TILA section 129C(b)(2)(E), 15 U.S.C. 1639c(b)(2)(E) (granting the Bureau authority to deem balloon loans “qualified mortgages” under certain circumstances, including that the loan is extended by a creditor described meeting the same conditions set forth for the exemption from the escrow requirement).</footnote>
        As explained more fully in the 2013 ATR Final Rule and 2013 Escrows Final Rule, the Bureau is finalizing a more broad definition of “rural,” acknowledging that the exemption will nonetheless be narrowed by the additional conditions.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is defining “rural” as UICs 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12. These codes comprise all areas outside of MSAs and outside of all micropolitan statistical areas except micropolitan statistical areas that are not adjacent to MSAs. According to current U.S. Census data, approximately 10 percent of the U.S. population lives in these areas.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Exemption for HPMLs secured by properties in rural counties from the additional appraisal requirement. The Agencies believe that the definition of “rural” county used by the Bureau is appropriate for the exemption from the requirement to obtain an additional appraisal under § 1026.35(c)(4)(i) for loans in rural areas. In addition, the Agencies view consistency across mortgage rules in defining rural county as desirable for compliance and enforcement. Thus, the exemption in § 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(H) cross-references the definition of rural county in the HPML escrow provisions of revised § 1026.35(b) (see 2013 Escrows Final Rule, § 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)). (The same definition of rural county is adopted by the Bureau in the 2013 ATR Final rule, § 1026.43(f)(2)(vi) and comment 43(f)(2)(vi-1).) The Agencies have considered several factors in determining how to define the scope of the exemption.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>First, the Agencies believe that creditors must be readily able to determine whether a particular transaction qualifies for the exemption. This will be possible because the Bureau will annually publish on its Web site a table of the counties in which properties would qualify for this exemption. Comment 35(c)(4)(vii)(H)-1 cross-references comment 35(b)(2)(iv)-1, which clarifies that the Bureau will publish on its Web site the applicable table of counties for each calendar year by the end of that calendar year. The comment further clarifies that a property securing an HPML subject to § 1026.35(c) is in a rural county under § 1026(c)(4)(vii)(H) if the county in which the property is located is on the table of rural counties most recently published by the Bureau. The comment provides the following example: for a transaction occurring in 2015, assume that the Bureau most recently published a table of rural counties at the end of 2014. The property securing the transaction would be located in a rural county for purposes of § 1026(c)(4)(vii)(H) if the county is on the table of rural counties published by the Bureau at the end of 2014. The Agencies anticipate that loan officers and others will be able to look on the Bureau Web site to identify whether the county in which the subject property is located is on the list.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Second, the Agencies endeavored to create an exemption tailored to address key concerns raised by commenters requesting a rural exemption, based on data findings by the Agencies. The principal concerns that the Agencies identified among commenters were that: first, adequate numbers of appraisers might not be available in rural areas for creditors to comply with the additional appraisal requirement and; second, the cost of obtaining the additional appraisal might deter some creditors from making HPMLs in these areas, many of which might already be underserved, reducing credit access for rural consumers. As noted in the proposed rule and discussed below, the potential reduction in credit access might be disproportionally greater in rural areas than in non-rural areas because the proportion of HPMLs is higher in rural as opposed to non-rural areas.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For the reasons explained below, the Agencies believe that the exemption for loans in rural areas as defined in the final rule is appropriately tailored to address these and related concerns. By better ensuring credit access and lowering costs among creditors extending HPMLs in rural areas, including small community banks, the exemption is expected to benefit the public and promote the safety and soundness of creditors. See TILA section 129H(b)(4)(B), 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(4)(B).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Appraiser availability. As noted, commenters indicated that in some rural areas it can be difficult to find appraisers who are both competent to appraise a particular rural property and also readily available. The cost-benefit analysis conducted by the Bureau for the proposal focused in part on estimating appraiser availability in particular areas and identified counties in which fewer than two appraisers with requisite credentials indicated having a business or home address.<footnote ref="85">See 77 FR 54722, 54752-54753 (Sept. 5, 2012).</footnote>
        However, commenters noted and the Agencies confirmed based on additional outreach for this final rule that not all appraisers whose home or business address is in a particular geographic area are competent to appraise properties in that area. Thus, to inform the final rule, the Bureau expanded its research from that conducted for the proposal.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For the final rule, the Bureau computed how many appraisers showed that they had a home or business address within a 50-mile radius of the center of each census tract in which an HPML loan was reported in the 2011 HMDA data.<footnote ref="86">The appraisers accounted for in the Bureau's analysis of the National Appraiser Registry were listed on the Registry as “active,” “AQB Compliant” and either licensed or certified. The Registry is available at https://www.asc.gov/National-Registry/NationalRegistry.aspx. “AQB Compliant” means that the appraiser met the Real Property Appraisal Qualification Criteria as promulgated by the Appraisal Qualifications Board on education, experience, and examination. See Appraisal Subcommittee of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, https://www.asc.gov/Frequently-Asked-Questions/FrequentlyAskedQuestions.aspx#AQB%20Compliant%20meaning.</footnote>
        The 50-mile radius test was intended to be a proxy for the potential service area for an appraiser in a more rural area and would cover properties located in roughly an hour's drive of an appraiser's home or office location.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>On this basis, the Bureau found that, of 262,989 HMDA-reported HPMLs in 2011, 603 had fewer than five appraisers within a 50-mile radius of the center of the tract in which the securing property was located; 484 of these loans were in areas covered by the final rule's rural exclusion. Based on FHFA data, the Bureau estimates that 5 percent of these HPMLs were potentially covered by the statute's additional appraisal requirement because they were purchase-money HPMLs secured by properties sold within a 180-day window.<footnote ref="87">Based on county recorder information from select counties licensed to FHFA by DataQuick Information Systems.</footnote>
        A lower proportion would have been flips with a price increase. See TILA section 129H(b)(2)(A), 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(2)(A). But taking solely the number of flips without regard to price increase or other exemptions (see § 1026.35(c)(2) and (c)(4)(vii)), an estimated 30 HPML transactions that were flips had fewer than five appraisers within a 50-mile radius of the center of the census tract in which they were located (5 percent of 603 HPMLs). Twenty-four of these would have been covered by the rural exemption as defined in the final rule (5 percent of 484 HPMLs).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>On this basis, the Agencies have concluded that the exemption is reasonably tailored to exclude from coverage of the additional appraisal requirement the loans for which appraiser availability might be an issue.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Credit access. Commenters also raised concerns about credit access, emphasizing that a larger proportion of loans in rural areas are HPMLs than in non-rural areas. Commenters suggested that the additional appraisal requirement could deter some creditors from extending HPML credit. See § 1026.35(c)(4)(v) and corresponding section-by-section analysis.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The additional appraisal requirement entails several compliance steps. After identifying that a loan is an HPML under § 1026.35(a), a creditor will need to assess whether the HPML is exempt from the appraisal requirements entirely under § 1026.35(c)(2). If the loan is not exempt as a qualified mortgage or other type of transaction exempt under § 1026.35(c)(2), the creditor will need to determine whether the HPML is one of the transactions that is exempt from the additional appraisal requirement under § 1026.35(c)(4)(vii). If the HPML is not exempt from the additional appraisal requirement, the creditor will need to determine whether the requirement to obtain an additional appraisal is triggered based on the date and, if necessary, price of the seller's acquisition of the property securing the HPML. See § 1026.35(c)(4)(i)(A) and (B). (Alternatively, the creditor could assume that the requirement applies and order two appraisals without taking each of these steps.) If the requirement is triggered, the creditor must obtain an additional appraisal performed by a certified or licensed appraiser, the cost of which cannot be charged to the consumer. See id. and § 1026.35(c)(4)(v).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>If these compliance obligations would deter some creditors from extending HPMLs, the impact on credit access might be greater in rural areas as defined in the final rule than in non-rural areas, because a significantly larger proportion of residential mortgage loans made in rural areas are HPMLs than in non-rural areas. Again, based on 2011 HMDA data, 12 percent of rural first-lien, purchase-money loans were HPMLs compared to four percent of non-rural first-lien, purchase-money loan.<footnote ref="88">Robert B. Avery, Neil Bhutta, Kenneth B. Brevoort, and Glenn Canner, “The Mortgage Market in 2011: Highlights from the Data Reported under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act,” FR Bulletin, Vol. 98, no. 6 (Dec. 2012) http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2012/PDF/2011_HMDA.pdf.</footnote>
        That is, recent data indicates that HPMLs occur three times as often in the rural setting.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Thus, an important consideration for the Agencies in determining the scope of the exemption was the comparative number of creditors extending HPMLs in various geographic areas. To this end, the Agencies considered, based on HMDA data, the number of creditors reported to have extended HPML credit in the geographic units defined by the 12 UICs. (For more details, see the Section 1022(b)(2) cost-benefit analysis in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION below.) The Agencies believe that in the areas with a greater number of lenders reporting that they extended HPMLs, the additional appraisal requirement will have a lower impact on credit access.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>HMDA data for 2011 show that a sharp drop-off in the number of creditors reporting to extend HPML credit occurs in micropolitan statistical areas not adjacent to MSAs (UIC 8), compared to MSAs and micropolitan statistical areas that are adjacent to MSAs.<footnote ref="89">More detail about the population densities represented by the 12 UICs is provided in the Section 1022(b)(2) analysis in Part V of the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION.</footnote>
        Specifically, 10 creditors reported that they extended HPMLs in a median county classified as UIC 8 in 2011; by contrast, in the median counties of the UICs with the next highest populations (UICs 2, 3, 5), the number of creditors reporting that they extended HPMLs was 24, 18, and 16, respectively. The drop-off in numbers of HPML creditors continues for UICs representing non-MSAs and non-micropolitan statistical areas.<footnote ref="90">Ten creditors reported extending HPML credit in 2011 in UICs 6 and 4; six in UIC 11; seven in UIC 9; six in UIC 7; four in UIC 10; and three in UIC 12.</footnote></analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies also looked at the estimated number of flips in areas encompassed by the rural exemption of the final rule to determine whether the consumer protections lost might outweigh the benefits of the exemption. As explained in greater detail in the Section 1022(b)(2) analysis, the Bureau estimates that, based on HMDA data, 122,806 purchase-money HPMLs were made in 2011; 21,370 of those were in the areas covered by the rural exclusion. As noted, the Bureau estimates that the proportion of purchase-money HPMLs involving properties sold within 180 days is 5 percent.<footnote ref="91">Based on county recorder information from select counties licensed to FHFA by DataQuick Information Systems.</footnote>
        Thus, of HPMLs in rural counties as defined in the final rule, an estimated 5 percent would have been flips. This number does not account for any other exemptions from the HPML appraisal rules that might apply to these HPMLs under § 1026.35(c)(2) or (c)(4)(vii). It also does not account for the price increase thresholds defining a transaction covered under the additional appraisal requirement in this final rule. See § 1026.35(c)(4)(i)(A) and (B) and corresponding section-by-section analysis.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies believe that the exemption for HPMLs secured by rural properties appropriately balances credit access and consumer protection. As the data above suggests, the estimated number of HPML consumers that would not receive the protections of an additional appraisal due to this exemption is very small. Moreover, the Agencies note that affected HPML consumers would still receive the consumer protections afforded by the general requirement for an interior-inspection appraisal performed by a certified or licensed appraiser. See § 1026.35(c)(3)(i).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In sum, the Agencies believe that the exemption in § 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(G) will help ensure that creditors in rural areas are able to extend HPML credit without undue burden, which will in turn mitigate any detrimental impacts on access to credit in rural areas that might result absent the exemption. The Agencies further believe that the exemption is appropriately tailored to ensure that needed consumer protections regarding appraisals are in place in areas where they are needed. For all of the reasons explained above, the Agencies have concluded that the exemption in § 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(H) is in the public interest and promotes the safety and soundness of creditors.</analysisParagraph>

    <title>35(c)(4)(vii) Exemptions From the Additional Appraisal Requirement</title>
    <analysisParagraph>TILA section 129H(b)(4)(B) permits the Agencies to exempt jointly a class of loans from the additional appraisal requirement if the Agencies determine the exemption “is in the public interest and promotes the safety and soundness of creditors.” 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(4)(B). The Agencies did not expressly propose any exemptions from the additional appraisal requirement, but invited comment on whether exempting any classes of higher-risk mortgage loans from the additional appraisal requirement (beyond the exemptions in § 1026.35(c)(2)) would be in the public interest and promote the safety and soundness of creditors. The Agencies offered a number of examples of potential exemptions, such as loans made in rural areas, and transactions that are currently exempt from the restrictions on FHA insurance applicable to property resales in the FHA Anti-Flipping Rule, including, among others, sales by government agencies of certain properties, sales of properties acquired by inheritance, and sales by State- and federally-chartered financial institutions.<footnote ref="76">The FHA exceptions to the restrictions on FHA insurance are as follows:</footnote>
      See, e.g., 24 CFR 203.37a(c).

      <title>Public Comments on the Proposal</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies received over fifty comments concerning the questions asked by the Agencies about appropriate exemptions from the additional appraisal requirement. Several commenters opposed requiring two appraisals under any circumstances. However, the Agencies note that the additional appraisal requirement is mandated by statute. TILA section 129H(b)(2), 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(2). Commenters in general strongly supported an exemption for loans made in rural areas. The commenters stated that there are limited numbers of licensed and certified appraisers in rural areas, which would make the additional appraisal requirement (requiring appraisals by two independent appraisers) particularly burdensome in these areas. In addition, commenters argued that lenders in rural areas may be forced to hire appraisers from far outside the geographic area, which would increase the time and cost associated with the transaction. Several commenters also stated that rural areas have not historically been sources of fraudulent real estate flipping activity. A number of commenters noted that property prices in rural areas tend to be lower, so the cost of the second appraisal is higher as a percentage of the overall transaction. Two commenters, national trade associations for appraisers, opposed the exemption for rural loans, suggesting that it is not difficult to find two appraisers to value rural properties.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As for how to define “rural,” one commenter, a national trade association for community banks, suggested that the agencies use a definition of “rural” that is consistent with the definition used in rules addressing the use of escrow accounts. See 2011 Escrows Proposal, discussed below, revised and adopted in the 2013 Escrows Final Rule.<footnote ref="79">See also 2011 ATR Proposal at 28471, revised and adopted in the 2013 ATR Final Rule, § 1026.43(f)(2)(vi) and comment 43(f)(2)(vi-1).</footnote>
        Another commenter, a financial holding company, suggested that the final rule exempt lenders located in areas where the State appraiser licensing or certification roster shows five or fewer unaffiliated appraisers within a reasonable distance, such as 50 miles or less. A large bank further recommended that the final rule exempt loans secured by properties in low-density appraiser markets, such as states with fewer than 500 appraisers or counties with fewer than five appraisers.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>A large number of commenters also supported an exemption for transactions that are currently exempted from the restrictions on FHA insurance applicable to property resales in the FHA Anti-Flipping Rule. The commenters argued that these categories of transactions do not present the same risk to consumers and therefore do not require the additional anti-flipping consumer protections.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Two commenters, national trade associations for appraisers, objected to adding any exemptions to the additional appraisal requirement, and suggested that there should be a strong presumption that an additional appraisal is necessary to protect consumers and to promote the safety and soundness of financial institutions.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>A number of commenters suggested other exemptions or endorsed exemptions from the entire rule already in the proposal. These are as follows.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>• Three commenters (a national trade association for the banking industry, a State trade association for the banking industry, and a bank holding company) suggested an exemption from the second appraisal requirement in cases when the initial appraisal is performed by an appraiser who was selected from the creditor's list of qualified appraisers. The commenters stated that eliminating the seller's ability to influence the selection of the appraiser in this fashion would be sufficient to protect the borrower from the risk of an artificially-inflated appraisal, thereby addressing the fraudulent “flipping” concern the statute seeks to address.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>• Two commenters (a nonprofit organization and State credit union association) suggested an exemption for active duty military personnel who receive permanent change of duty station orders.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>• A number of commenters (including national trade associations for the mortgage finance and retail banking industry) suggested exemptions for certain non-purchase transactions, such as gifts, transfers in connection with trusts, transfers that do not generate capital gains, and intra-family transfers for estate planning purposes, on grounds that these transactions are not “profit seeking.” Several commenters suggested that transfers in connection with a divorce decree be included in this category as an exemption.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>• Many commenters (including two national trade associations for the mortgage finance and retail banking industry, a national trade association for the banking industry, a national trade association for community banks, a national trade association for credit unions, four regional associations for credit unions, a large national bank, a financial holding company, and a community bank) endorsed exemptions for construction and bridge loans, on grounds that these are temporary loans and that consumers are not exposed to risk at the level comparable to other residential loans that Congress targeted in the statute. These commenters also argued that the additional appraisal requirement would be impractical for construction loans, given the inability to conduct interior inspections.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>• Two commenters (a community bank and a credit union) suggested an exemption for non-purchase acquisitions and transfers where the consumer previously held a partial interest in the property and cited to Regulation Z (commentary on the definition of residential mortgage transaction) as support.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <analysisParagraph>In response to widespread support for adopting exemptions consistent with exemptions from the restrictions on FHA financing in the FHA Anti-Flipping Rule, the Agencies are adopting several exemptions from the additional appraisal requirement generally consistent with exemptions in the FHA Anti-Flipping Rule under 24 CFR 203.37a(c). These are extensions of credit that finance the consumer's acquisition of a property:</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>• From a local, State or Federal government agency (§ 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(A); see also 24 CFR 203.37a(c)(1), (2) and (7)).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>• From an entity that acquired the property through foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or other similar judicial or non-judicial procedures as a result of exercising the person's rights as a holder of a defaulted mortgage loan (§ 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(B); see also 24 CFR 203.37a(c)(6)).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>• From a non-profit entity as part of a local, State or Federal government program under which the non-profit entity is permitted to acquire single-family properties for resale from a seller who acquired the property through foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, or other similar judicial or non-judicial procedure (§ 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(C); see also 24 CFR 203.37a(c)(3)).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>• From a seller who acquired the property pursuant to a court order of dissolution of marriage, civil union or domestic partnership, or of partition of joint or marital assets to which the seller was a party (§ 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(D); see also 24 CFR 203.37a(c)(4)).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>• From an employer or relocation agency in connection with the relocation of an employee (§ 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(E); see also 24 CFR 203.37a(c)(4)).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>• Located in an area designated by the President as a federal disaster area, if and for as long as the Federal financial institutions regulatory agencies, as defined in 12 U.S.C. 3350(6), waive the requirements in title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, as amended (12 U.S.C. 3331 et seq.), and any implementing regulations in that area (§ 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(F); see also 12 CFR 203.37a(c)(4)).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Agencies are adopting an exemption for extensions of credit to finance the consumer's purchase of property being sold by a servicemember, as defined in 50 U.S.C. Appx. 511(1), if the servicemember receives deployment or permanent change of station orders after the servicemember purchased the property (§ 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(G)).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Agencies are adopting an exemption for HPMLs in rural areas (§ 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(H)). The exemption would apply to HPMLs secured by properties in counties considered “rural” under definitions promulgated by the Bureau in the 2013 ATR Final Rule and 2013 Escrows Final Rule—specifically, properties located within the following Urban Influence Codes (UICs), established by the United States Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Services (USDA-ERS): 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12. These UICs generally correspond with areas outside of metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) and Micropolitan Statistical Areas, defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). For reasons discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(H) and the Dodd-Frank Act Section 1022(b)(2) analysis in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION below, rural properties located in micropolitan statistical areas that are not adjacent to an MSA (UIC 8) are also included in the exemption.
      </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Each of these exemptions is discussed in turn below.</analysisParagraph>

  <analysisSection target="1026-35-c-5-ii" notice="2013-01809" date="2014-01-18">
    <title>35(c)(5)(ii) Timing of Disclosure</title>
    <analysisParagraph>TILA section 129H(d) requires that the appraisal notice be provided at the time of the application. 15 U.S.C. 1639h(d). Consistent with this requirement, and recognizing that the “higher-risk” status of the proposed loan would not necessarily be determined at the precise moment of the application, the Agencies proposed to require that the TILA section 129H notice “be mailed or delivered not later than the third business day after the creditor receives the consumer's application.” The proposed requirement also stated that, if the notice is not provided to the consumer in person, the consumer is presumed to have received the notice three days after its mailing or delivery.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>The final rule adopts this provision with two changes. First, the final rule omits the proposed language providing that “[i]f the disclosure is not provided to the consumer in person, the consumer is presumed to have received the disclosure three business days after they are mailed or delivered.” While commenters did not address the issue, the Agencies have concluded that the date of consumer receipt in this context is not relevant. By contrast, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis for § 1026.35(c)(6), below, the Agencies emphasize in the final rule the relevance of the date that a consumer receives the copy of the appraisal. Second, the final rule provides that, in the case of an application for a loan that is not an HPML at the time of application, but whose rate is set at an HPML level after application, the disclosure must be delivered or placed in the mail not later than the third business day after the creditor determines that the loan is an HPML.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisSection>
      <title>Public Comments on the Proposal</title>
      <analysisParagraph>In the proposal, the Agencies asked for comment on whether providing the notification at some other time would be more beneficial to consumers, and how the notification should be provided when an application is submitted by telephone, facsimile, or electronically. The Agencies further asked whether, in cases such as in-person or telephone applications, the notice should be provided at the time the application is received, or as part of the application. The Agencies also requested comment on whether a creditor who has a reasonable belief that the transaction will not be a “higher-risk mortgage loan” (now, HPML) at the time of application, but later determines that the applicant only qualifies for an HPML, should be allowed an opportunity to give the notice at some later time in the application process.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Timing issues for the HPML appraisal notice. The majority of commenters—banks, major industry trade associations, and a software and document service provider—supported a timing requirement that would allow them to integrate the HPML appraisal notice into the TILA-RESPA Loan Estimate (as proposed in the 2012 TILA-RESPA Proposal<footnote ref="98">77 FR 51116 (Aug. 23, 2012).</footnote>
        ), using the same disclosure timing requirement as proposed for that disclosure—within three business days after the application. This timing requirement is consistent with the Agencies' proposal for the HPML disclosure. These commenters offered three reasons why an earlier deadline would be inappropriate:</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>• The trade associations and the service provider noted that the lender cannot charge an appraisal fee before the TILA Good Faith Estimate (GFE) is disclosed and the consumer elects to proceed. See § 1026.19(a)(1)(ii) As a result, there is no value to an appraisal notice that precedes the TILA GFE.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>• One of the banks asserted that it would be difficult for a creditor to comply with a deadline for the notice that is any earlier than the TILA GFE disclosure deadline, because the rate and therefore “higher-risk mortgage” status of a loan is not typically known earlier. Similarly, the service provider also added that it would be unrealistic to expect the creditor to determine the status while the applicant is submitting the application.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>• The service provider also noted that consumers prefer integrated disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Two community banks and a State bank trade association submitted substantially identical comments opposing the three-business-day deadline, however. These commenters argued that complying with the notice requirement in the first few days after the application will slow the loan approval process and increase loan costs. These commenters called instead for a 10 business day deadline.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>No commenters responded to the question in the proposed rule of whether the notice should be provided at the time the application is received, or as part of the application.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Potential need for a mechanism to provide the notice later. Two banks, a credit union trade association at the State level, and a service provider supported including a method in the rule for a creditor to comply with the disclosure requirement if the loan is determined to be an HPML after the time of application. For example, if the rate were not locked, HPML status could arise later in the application process when the rate is set. One large bank noted, however, that if the language in the notice under this rule is the same as in the ECOA notice, then there would be no need to allow this type of cure right for loans that are subject to ECOA (i.e., first-lien dwelling-secured HPMLs).</analysisParagraph>
    </analysisSection>
    <analysisSection>
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Again, under § 1026.35(c)(5)(ii) of the final rule, the disclosure required under § 1026.35(c)(5)(i) shall be delivered or placed in the mail no later than the third business day after the creditor receives the consumer's application for a higher-priced mortgage loan subject to § 1026.35(c). In the case of a loan that is not a higher-priced mortgage loan subject to § 1026.35(c) at the time of application, but becomes a higher-priced mortgage loan subject to § 1026.35(c) after application, the disclosure must be delivered or placed in the mail not later than the third business day after the creditor determines that the loan is a higher-priced mortgage loan subject to § 1026.35(c).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Timing issues for the HPML appraisal notice. In § 1026.35(c)(5)(ii), the final rule adopts the proposed timing requirement of three business days after application. Congress did not define the statutory phrase “at the time of the application” when describing when the HRM appraisal notice must be provided. The Agencies believe that the three-business-day timeframe in the proposed rule is a reasonable and appropriate interpretation of the statute. As noted, commenters generally supported a timeframe that would allow for including the notice in the proposed combined TILA-RESPA Loan Estimate, which would be provided within three business days after the application. No commenter suggested that the Agencies should mandate either an earlier or separate notice. Industry commenters correctly pointed out that the appraisal charge cannot be levied prior to the TILA GFE (and, as proposed, the TILA-RESPA Loan Estimate) being provided in any event. As a result, it appears unlikely that creditors would order appraisals before this time, so consumers would not appear to have a significant need to receive the appraisal notice either earlier or separately from the GFE or Loan Estimate. Adding new separate notices could increase the volume of information consumers receive, and potentially decrease consumer understanding.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Agencies decline to adopt a timing requirement of more than three business days after application, as some commenters suggested. The statute requires that the disclosure be provided “at application,” and a three-business-day timing requirement implementing this would be consistent with the application-related disclosure requirements of other residential mortgage rules, most notably the current GFE and proposed TILA-RESPA Loan Estimate discussed above. See, e.g., § 1026.19(a)(1)(i); 77 FR 51116 (Aug. 23, 2012).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Potential need for a mechanism to provide the notice later. As one commenter noted, clarification may be needed on how a creditor could comply with the notice requirement when the loan becomes an HPML more than three days after application due to the higher-priced rate being set at a later date. As one commenter noted, this clarification would not be necessary for first-lien loans. ECOA, as implemented in Regulation B of the Bureau's 2013 ECOA Appraisals Final Rule, requires notice within three business days after application for all first-lien dwelling-secured loans, regardless of whether they are HPMLs. ECOA section 701(e)(5), 15 U.S.C. 1691(e)(5); 2013 ECOA Appraisals Final Rule § 1002.14(a)(1). Further, the HPML appraisal notice is integrated with the ECOA appraisal notice. See 2013 ECOA Appraisals Final Rule, § 1002.14(b) and appendix C, Form C-9. As the final rule makes clear, by complying with the ECOA notice requirement, the creditor would automatically comply with the HPML appraisal notice requirement, even if the creditor had not yet determined that the loan would be an HPML. Again, § 1026.35(c)(5)(i) provides that “[c]ompliance with the disclosure requirement in Regulation B § 1002.14(a)(2) satisfies the requirements of [the HPML appraisal disclosure requirement of § 1026.35(c)(5)(i)].”</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>By contrast, the ECOA appraisal notice requirement does not apply to subordinate-lien loans. Thus, for subordinate-lien mortgage creditors, a rate increase that occurs more than three business days after application (i.e.,
        after the required HPML appraisal rule disclosure should have been given) could trigger the HPML notice requirement. Accordingly, the Agencies are adopting additional regulation text providing that a creditor may issue the HPML appraisal notice within three business days of determining the rate.</analysisParagraph>

    <title>35(c)(6)(iv) No Charge for Copy of Appraisal</title>
    <analysisParagraph>TILA section 129H(c) provides that a creditor shall provide one copy of each appraisal conducted in accordance with this section in connection with a higher-risk mortgage to the applicant without charge. 15 U.S.C. 1639h(c). In the proposal, the Agencies interpreted this provision to prohibit creditors from charging consumers for providing a copy of written appraisals required for higher-risk mortgage loans. Accordingly, the proposal provided that a creditor must not charge the consumer for a copy of a written appraisal required to be provided to the consumer pursuant to new § 1026.35(c)(6)(i).</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>A proposed comment clarified that the creditor is prohibited from charging the consumer for any copy of a required appraisal, including by imposing a fee specifically for a required copy of an appraisal or by marking up the interest rate or any other fees payable by the consumer in connection with the higher-risk mortgage loan.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>The Agencies received no comments on this aspect of the proposal and adopt the proposed regulation text and comment without change in § 1026.35(c)(6)(iv) and comment 35(c)(6)(iv)-1.</analysisParagraph>

    <title>35(c)(7) Relation to Other Rules</title>
    <analysisParagraph>Section 1026.35(c)(7) clarifies that the final rule was adopted jointly by the Agencies. This provision states that the Board is codifying the HPML appraisal rules at 12 CFR 226.43 et seq.; the Bureau is codifying the HPML appraisal rules at 12 CFR 1026.35(a) and (c); and the OCC is codifying the HPML appraisal rules at 12 CFR Part 34 and 12 CFR Part 164. Section 1026.35(c)(7) further clarifies that there is no substantive difference among the three sets of rules.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>The NCUA and FHFA are adopting the rules as published in the Bureau's Regulation Z at 12 CFR 1026.35(a) and (c), by cross-referencing these rules in 12 CFR 722.3 and 12 CFR Part 1222, respectively. The FDIC is adopting the Bureau's Regulation Z at 12 CFR 1026.35(a) and (c) without a cross-reference.</analysisParagraph>
    <analysisParagraph>As noted above at the beginning of the section-by-section analysis, § 1026.35(a) is re-published in the final rule for ease of reference, and the joint rulemaking authority extends to § 1026.35(c).</analysisParagraph>

As revised, § 1026.35 will consist of four subsections—(a) Definitions; (b) Escrows for higher-priced mortgage loans; (c) Appraisals for higher-priced mortgage loans; and (d) Evasion; open-end credit.
