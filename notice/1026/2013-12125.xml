      <title>35(b)(2) Exemptions</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Overview</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Four of the Bureau's January 2013 mortgage rules included provisions that provide for special treatment under various Regulation Z requirements forcertain credit transactions in connection with &#8220;rural&#8221; or &#8220;underserved&#8221; areas: (1) &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) provides an exemption to the 2013 Escrows Final Rule's escrow requirement for HPMLs; (2) &#167; 1026.43(f) provides an allowance to originate balloon-payment qualified mortgages under the 2013 ATR Final Rule; (3) &#167; 1026.32(d)(1)(ii)(C) provides an exemption from the balloon payment prohibition on high-cost mortgages under the 2013 HOEPA Final Rule for balloon-payment qualified mortgages; and (4) &#167; 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(H) provides an exemption from a requirement to obtain a second appraisal for certain HPMLs under the 2013 Interagency Appraisals Final Rule. These provisions rely on the criteria for &#8220;rural&#8221; and/or &#8220;underserved&#8221; counties set forth in &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A) and (B), respectively, adopted in the 2013 Escrows Final Rule, which takes effect on June 1, 2013. Two of the special provisions for creditors operating predominantly in &#8220;rural&#8221; or &#8220;underserved&#8221; areas were set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act amendments to TILA, but the terms were not defined by statute. TILA section 129D, as added and amended by Dodd-Frank Act sections 1461 and 1462 and implemented by &#167; 1026.35(b), generally requires that creditors establish escrow accounts for HPMLs secured by a first lien on a consumer's principal dwelling, but the statute also authorizes the Bureau to exempt from this requirement transactions by a creditor that, among other criteria, &#8220;operates predominantly in rural or underserved areas.&#8221; TILA section 129D(c)(1). Similarly, the ability-to-repay provisions in Dodd-Frank Act section 1412 contain a set of criteria with regard to certain balloon-payment mortgages originated and held in portfolio by certain creditors that operate predominantly in rural or underserved areas, allowing those loans to be considered qualified mortgages.SeeTILA section 129C(b)(2)(E), 15 U.S.C. 1639c(b)(2)(E). In the 2013 Escrows and ATR Final Rules, the Bureau implemented the HPML escrows requirement and the section 1412 balloon-payment qualified mortgage provision through &#167;&#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) and 1026.43(f), respectively. In addition, the Bureau adopted an exemption to the general prohibition of balloon payments for high-cost mortgages when those mortgages meet the criteria for balloon-payment qualified mortgages set forth in &#167; 1026.43(f), as part of the 2013 HOEPA Final Rule, in &#167; 1026.32(d)(1)(ii)(C). Finally, the Bureau and other Federal agencies adopted &#167; 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(H), which provides an exemption from a requirement to obtain a second appraisal for certain HPMLs under the 2013 Interagency Appraisals Final Rule for credit transactions used to acquire property in rural counties.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Through the 2013 Escrows Final Rule, the Bureau adopted &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A) and (B) to define &#8220;rural&#8221; and &#8220;underserved&#8221; respectively for the purposes of the four rules discussed above that contain special provisions that use one or both of those terms. The 2013 Escrows Final Rule also provided comment 35(b)(2)(iv)-1 to clarify further the criteria for &#8220;rural&#8221; and &#8220;underserved&#8221; counties, and provided that the Bureau will annually update on its public Web site a list of counties that meet the definitions of rural and underserved in &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iv). In advance of the rule's June 1, 2013, effective date, the Bureau proposed to amend &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iv) and comment 35(b)(2)(iv)-1 to clarify how to determine whether a county is rural or underserved for the purposes of these provisions.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received several comments discussing the overall regulatory scheme regarding how &#8220;rural&#8221; and &#8220;underserved&#8221; should be defined. Most of these comments argued for an expanded scope for the &#8220;rural&#8221; and &#8220;underserved&#8221; definitions. One industry trade association suggested that the rural definition should include all non-metropolitan counties, as well as communities with populations of less than 50,000. Other commenters suggested that the Bureau should use Census Bureau data differently, and one suggested that any place not within one of the Census Bureau's &#8220;Urbanized Areas,&#8221; which contain 50,000 or more people, be considered rural. A credit union association suggested that credit unions with &#8220;rural&#8221; community charters should be exempt, and that only those creditors with a physical presence in an underserved area should be considered in relation to the underserved exemption. Some commenters felt that the rule was too confusing, making compliance difficult.<footnote ref="14">The Bureau notes that it has now posted the official list of rural and underserved counties on its public Web site for use with mortgages consummated from June 1, 2013, through December 31, 2013. The final, official list is identical to the preliminary list posted on the Bureau's public Web site on March 12, 2013. Creditors may rely as a safe harbor for compliance with the relevant regulations on the official lists of rural and underserved counties posted by the Bureau. The official list for use in 2014 will be posted when the necessary data become available.</footnote> One credit union was concerned about the impact the escrows rule would have on mobile home lending. One commenter stated that, although the clarification presented in the proposal was welcome, there is still too much confusion regarding the escrows rule, and that its effective date should be postponed to January 2014. In addition, two commenters suggested that the Bureau apply exemptions based solely on the size of a creditor, regardless of location.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Although the Bureau has examined these comments, the proposed rule presented only very limited changes and clarifications to the 2013 Final Escrows Rule, and solicited comments on those narrow issues. Broader concerns such as those expressed by the foregoing commenters about preserving consumers' access to credit will be addressed in the Bureau's final rule under the 2013 ATR Concurrent Proposal, which the Bureau expects to issue shortly. The specific provisions included in the proposal are discussed below, along with comments responsive to those issues.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter supported generally the clarifications provided in the rule. Other industry commenters chose to neither support nor oppose the &#8220;adjacent&#8221; clarification, and asked that there be more analysis of the impact of excluding counties from the rural definition if they are &#8220;adjacent&#8221; to a metropolitan area.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters opposed the proposed method for determining the status of a new county, arguing that a new county should be considered rural if 50% of its land is taken from counties that were previously considered rural.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed modifications to &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) and comment 35(b)(2)(iii)-1.i for clarification purposes and for consistency with other provisions. As adopted in January, &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iii) and its commentary stated that the Bureau would designate or determine which counties are rural or underserved for the purposes of the special provisions of the four rules discussed above. However, that was not the Bureau's intent. Rather, the Bureau intended to require determinations of &#8220;rural&#8221; or &#8220;underserved&#8221; status to be made by creditors as prescribed by &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A) and (B), but also intended for the Bureau to apply both tests to each U.S. county and publish an annual list of counties that satisfy either test for a given calendar year, which creditors may rely upon as a safe harbor. Therefore, the Bureau proposed modifications to &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(A) and comment 35(b)(2)(iii)-1.i for the purposes of clarification and consistency with these provisions.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As adopted in January 2013, &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A) defines &#8220;rural&#8221;based on currently applicable UICs established by the USDA-ERS. The UICs are based on the definitions of &#8220;metropolitan statistical area&#8221; and &#8220;micropolitan statistical area&#8221; as developed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), along with other factors reviewed by the ERS that place counties into twelve separately defined UICs depending, in part, on the size of the largest city and town in the county. Based on these definitions, &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A) as adopted states that a county is &#8220;rural&#8221; during a calendar year if it is neither in a metropolitan statistical area nor in a micropolitan statistical area that is adjacent to a metropolitan statistical area, as those terms are defined by OMB and applied under currently applicable UICs.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As adopted, comment 35(b)(2)(iv)-1.i explained that, for the purposes of the provision, the terms &#8220;metropolitan statistical areas&#8221; and &#8220;micropolitan statistical areas adjacent to a metropolitan statistical area&#8221; are given the same meanings used by USDA-ERS for the purposes of determining UICs. The USDA-ERS considers micropolitan counties as &#8220;adjacent&#8221; to a metropolitan statistical area for this purpose if they abut a metropolitan statistical area and have at least 2% of employed persons commuting to work in the core of the metropolitan statistical area.<footnote ref="15">See http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/urban-influence-codes/documentation.aspx.</footnote> It was thus implicit in this comment that &#8220;adjacent&#8221; is given the same meaning used by the USDA-ERS for the purposes of &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Nevertheless, the Bureau believed that additional commentary explaining the meaning of &#8220;adjacent&#8221; more directly would be useful to facilitate compliance with &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iv) and the provisions that rely on it. Accordingly, the Bureau proposed to amend comment 35(b)(2)(iv)-1.i to state expressly that &#8220;adjacent&#8221; entails physical contiguity with a metropolitan statistical area where certain minimum commuting standards are also met, as defined by the USDA-ERS. The Bureau believed that this would be consistent with USDA-ERS's use of &#8220;adjacent&#8221; and better explain the rule for compliance purposes.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Similarly, the Bureau proposed language to specify under &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A) how &#8220;rural&#8221; status should be determined for a county that does not have a currently applicable UIC because it was created after the USDA-ERS last categorized counties by UIC. Because the USDA-ERS only updates UICs decennially based on the most recent census, it is possible that new counties may be created that will not have a designated UIC until after the next census. In such instances, clarification was needed to explain how &#8220;rural&#8221; status would be determined. The Bureau thus proposed to amend comment 35(b)(2)(iv)-1.i to address this issue and explain that any such county is considered &#8220;rural&#8221; for the purposes of &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iv) only if all counties from which the new county's land was taken were themselves rural under the rule.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also proposed comment 35(b)(2)(iv)-2.i to provide an example of how &#8220;rural&#8221; status would be determined. In addition, the Bureau proposed small technical changes to the rule provision and commentary to enhance clarity.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Section 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(A) creates an exemption from the HPML escrow requirement for transactions by creditors operating in rural or underserved counties, if they meet certain criteria involving the loans they originatedduring the preceding calendar year.Thus, the availability of the rural or underserved exemption always follows a year after the origination activity that makes a creditor eligible for the exemption.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As adopted by the 2013 Escrows Final Rule, &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(B) stated that a county would be &#8220;underserved&#8221; during a calendar year if, &#8220;according to Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data for that year,&#8221; no more than two creditors extended covered transactions, as defined in &#167; 1026.43(b)(1), secured by a first lien, five or more times in the county. However, HMDA data typically are released for a given calendar year during the third quarter of each subsequent calendar year. It is thus not generally possible for creditors to make determinations concerning whether a county was underserved during the preceding calendar year based on that preceding year's HMDA data, because such data likely will not be available until late in the following year. In wording &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(B) as it did, the Bureau did not intend to require the use of HMDA data that would not be available at the time the determination of a county's &#8220;underserved&#8221; status was made; the Bureau's intent was to provide for the use of the most recent HMDA data available at the time of the determination.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau therefore proposed to amend &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(B) to clarify that a county is considered &#8220;underserved&#8221; during a given calendar year based on HMDA data for &#8220;the preceding calendar year&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;that calendar year.&#8221; This look-back feature coordinates with the look-back feature in the exemption itself at &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(A), so that a creditor would rely on the underserved status of a county based on HMDA data from two years previous to the use of the exemption, which are the most recent data available for use as the Bureau intended. The Bureau also proposed to amend comment 35(b)(2)(iv)-1.ii to conform to this change, and to add comment 35(b)(2)(iv)-2.ii to provide an example.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed language in &#167; 1026.35(e) to keep in place existing requirements contained in &#167; 1026.35(b)concerning assessment of consumers' ability to repay an HPML and limitations on prepayment penalties for HPMLs. These provisions were originally adopted by the Board in 2008,<footnote ref="16">73 FR 44522 (July 30, 2008).</footnote> and will be supplanted by the Bureau's new rules implementing similar Dodd-Frank requirements in &#167; 1026.43 on January 10, 2014.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The 2013 Escrows Final Rule inadvertently removed the existing language of &#167; 1026.35(b) between June 1, 2013, and the January 10, 2014, effective date for the ability-to-repay and prepayment penalty provisions in &#167; 1026.43. The Bureau proposed restoring this language at &#167; 1026.35(e) and keeping it in effect during that intervening period. The Bureau also proposed updating existing cross-references to the &#167; 1026.35(b) HPML provisions.</analysisParagraph>

        <analysisParagraph>Nevertheless, the Bureau believed that additional commentary explaining the meaning of &#8220;adjacent&#8221; more directly would be useful to facilitate compliance with &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iv) and the provisions that rely on it. Accordingly, the Bureau proposed to amend comment 35(b)(2)(iv)-1.i to state expressly that &#8220;adjacent&#8221; entails physical contiguity with a metropolitan statistical area where certain minimum commuting standards are also met, as defined by the USDA-ERS. The Bureau believed that this would be consistent with USDA-ERS's use of &#8220;adjacent&#8221; and better explain the rule for compliance purposes.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Similarly, the Bureau proposed language to specify under &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A) how &#8220;rural&#8221; status should be determined for a county that does not have a currently applicable UIC because it was created after the USDA-ERS last categorized counties by UIC. Because the USDA-ERS only updates UICs decennially based on the most recent census, it is possible that new counties may be created that will not have a designated UIC until after the next census. In such instances, clarification was needed to explain how &#8220;rural&#8221; status would be determined. The Bureau thus proposed to amend comment 35(b)(2)(iv)-1.i to address this issue and explain that any such county is considered &#8220;rural&#8221; for the purposes of &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iv) only if all counties from which the new county's land was taken were themselves rural under the rule.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also proposed comment 35(b)(2)(iv)-2.i to provide an example of how &#8220;rural&#8221; status would be determined. In addition, the Bureau proposed small technical changes to the rule provision and commentary to enhance clarity.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Section 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(A) creates an exemption from the HPML escrow requirement for transactions by creditors operating in rural or underserved counties, if they meet certain criteria involving the loans they originatedduring the preceding calendar year.Thus, the availability of the rural or underserved exemption always follows a year after the origination activity that makes a creditor eligible for the exemption.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As adopted by the 2013 Escrows Final Rule, &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(B) stated that a county would be &#8220;underserved&#8221; during a calendar year if, &#8220;according to Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data for that year,&#8221; no more than two creditors extended covered transactions, as defined in &#167; 1026.43(b)(1), secured by a first lien, five or more times in the county. However, HMDA data typically are released for a given calendar year during the third quarter of each subsequent calendar year. It is thus not generally possible for creditors to make determinations concerning whether a county was underserved during the preceding calendar year based on that preceding year's HMDA data, because such data likely will not be available until late in the following year. In wording &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(B) as it did, the Bureau did not intend to require the use of HMDA data that would not be available at the time the determination of a county's &#8220;underserved&#8221; status was made; the Bureau's intent was to provide for the use of the most recent HMDA data available at the time of the determination.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau therefore proposed to amend &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(B) to clarify that a county is considered &#8220;underserved&#8221; during a given calendar year based on HMDA data for &#8220;the preceding calendar year&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;that calendar year.&#8221; This look-back feature coordinates with the look-back feature in the exemption itself at &#167; 1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(A), so that a creditor would rely on the underserved status of a county based on HMDA data from two years previous to the use of the exemption, which are the most recent data available for use as the Bureau intended. The Bureau also proposed to amend comment 35(b)(2)(iv)-1.ii to conform to this change, and to add comment 35(b)(2)(iv)-2.ii to provide an example.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed language in &#167; 1026.35(e) to keep in place existing requirements contained in &#167; 1026.35(b)concerning assessment of consumers' ability to repay an HPML and limitations on prepayment penalties for HPMLs. These provisions were originally adopted by the Board in 2008,<footnote ref="16">73 FR 44522 (July 30, 2008).</footnote> and will be supplanted by the Bureau's new rules implementing similar Dodd-Frank requirements in &#167; 1026.43 on January 10, 2014.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The 2013 Escrows Final Rule inadvertently removed the existing language of &#167; 1026.35(b) between June 1, 2013, and the January 10, 2014, effective date for the ability-to-repay and prepayment penalty provisions in &#167; 1026.43. The Bureau proposed restoring this language at &#167; 1026.35(e) and keeping it in effect during that intervening period. The Bureau also proposed updating existing cross-references to the &#167; 1026.35(b) HPML provisions.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Comments</title>
        <analysisParagraph>One industry commenter supported generally the clarifications provided in the rule. Other industry commenters chose to neither support nor oppose the &#8220;adjacent&#8221; clarification, and asked that there be more analysis of the impact of excluding counties from the rural definition if they are &#8220;adjacent&#8221; to a metropolitan area.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Industry commenters opposed the proposed method for determining the status of a new county, arguing that a new county should be considered rural if 50% of its land is taken from counties that were previously considered rural.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting the provisions as proposed. The definition of &#8220;adjacent&#8221; was already implicit in the 2013 Escrows Final Rule, and the Bureau's earlier impact analyses already accounted for that definition. The present rule's guidance provision merely clarifies what was adopted then.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau considered the suggestion to allow rural status for new counties if at least 50% of the counties' land comes from previously rural counties, but was concerned that making such determinations would be burdensome and inexact for compliance purposes and incongruent with the rule's overall rural designations. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting the clarification as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
