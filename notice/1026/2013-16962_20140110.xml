          <content>Section <ref target="1026-43-e-2-vi" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(2)(vi)</ref> provides that, to satisfy the requirements for a qualified mortgage under § <ref target="1026-43-e-2" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(2)</ref>, the ratio of the consumer's total monthly debt payments to total monthly income at the time of consummation cannot exceed 43 percent. Section <ref target="1026-43-e-2-vi-A" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(2)(vi)(A)</ref> requires the creditor to calculate the ratio of the consumer's total monthly debt payments to total monthly income using the following standards, with additional requirements for calculating debt and income appearing in § <ref target="1026-43-e-2-vi-B" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(2)(vi)(B)</ref>. Where guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or the Rural Housing Service, or issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) while operating under the conservatorship or receivership of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or issued by a limited-life regulatory entity succeeding the charter of either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (collectively, Agency or GSE guidance) is in accordance with appendix Q, creditors may look to that guidance as a helpful resource in applying appendix Q. Moreover, when the following standards do not resolve how a specific kind of debt or income should be treated, the creditor may either (1) exclude the income or include the debt, or (2) rely on Agency or GSE guidance to resolve the issue. The following standards resolve the appropriate treatment of a specific kind of debt or income where the standards provide a discernible answer to the question of how to treat the debt or income. However, a creditor may not rely on Agency or GSE guidance to reach a resolution contrary to that provided by the following standards, even if such Agency or GSE guidance specifically addresses the particular type of debt or income but the following standards provide more generalized guidance.</content>

        <content>Pursuant to § <ref target="1026-41-e-4-ii-A" reftype="internal">1026.41(e)(4)(ii)(A)</ref>, to qualify as a small servicer, a servicer must service, together with any <ref target="1026-32-b-5" reftype="term">affiliates</ref>, 5,000 or fewer <ref target="1026-39-a-2" reftype="term">mortgage loans</ref>, for all of which the servicer (or an <ref target="1026-32-b-5" reftype="term">affiliate</ref>) is the creditor or assignee. There are two elements to this requirement. First, a servicer, together with any <ref target="1026-32-b-5" reftype="term">affiliates</ref>, must service 5,000 or fewer <ref target="1026-39-a-2" reftype="term">mortgage loans</ref>. Second, a servicer must service only <ref target="1026-39-a-2" reftype="term">mortgage loans</ref> for which the servicer (or an <ref target="1026-32-b-5" reftype="term">affiliate</ref>) is the creditor or assignee. To be the creditor or assignee of a <ref target="1026-39-a-2" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref>, the servicer (or an <ref target="1026-32-b-5" reftype="term">affiliate</ref>) must either currently own the <ref target="1026-39-a-2" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref> or must have been the entity to which the <ref target="1026-39-a-2" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref> obligation was initially payable (that is, the originator of the <ref target="1026-39-a-2" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref>). A servicer is not a small servicer if it services any <ref target="1026-39-a-2" reftype="term">mortgage loans</ref> for which the servicer or an <ref target="1026-32-b-5" reftype="term">affiliate</ref> is not the creditor or assignee (that is, for which the servicer or an <ref target="1026-32-b-5" reftype="term">affiliate</ref> is not the owner or was not the originator). The following two examples demonstrate circumstances in which a servicer would not qualify as a small servicer because it did not meet both requirements for determining a servicer's status as a small servicer:</content>
        <interpParagraph label="1026-41-e-4-ii-Interp-2-i" marker="i.">

An <ref target="1026-32-b-5" reftype="term">affiliate</ref> of the servicer services 4,000 other <ref target="1026-39-a-2" reftype="term">mortgage loans</ref>, all of which it or an <ref target="1026-32-b-5" reftype="term">affiliate</ref> owns or originated.

        <title>Mortgage loans not considered in determining whether a servicer is a small servicer.</title>
        <content><ref target="1026-39-a-2" reftype="term">Mortgage loans</ref> that are not considered for purposes of determining whether a servicer is a small servicer pursuant to § <ref target="1026-41-e-4-iii" reftype="internal">1026.41(e)(4)(iii)</ref> are not considered either for determining whether a servicer, together with any <ref target="1026-32-b-5" reftype="term">affiliates</ref>, services 5,000 or fewer <ref target="1026-39-a-2" reftype="term">mortgage loans</ref> or whether a servicer is servicing only <ref target="1026-39-a-2" reftype="term">mortgage loans</ref> that it owns or originated. For example, assume a servicer services 5,400 <ref target="1026-39-a-2" reftype="term">mortgage loans</ref>. Of these <ref target="1026-39-a-2" reftype="term">mortgage loans</ref>, the servicer owns or originated 4,800 <ref target="1026-39-a-2" reftype="term">mortgage loans</ref>, voluntarily services 300 <ref target="1026-39-a-2" reftype="term">mortgage loans</ref> that it does not own or did not originate for an unaffiliated nonprofit organization for which the servicer does not receive any compensation or fees, and services 300 <ref target="1026-33-a" reftype="term">reverse mortgage transactions</ref> that it does not own and did not originate. Because the only <ref target="1026-39-a-2" reftype="term">mortgage loans</ref> considered are the 4,800 <ref target="1026-39-a-2" reftype="term">mortgage loans</ref> owned or originated by the servicer, the servicer is considered a small servicer and qualifies for the small servicer exemption with regard to all 5,400 <ref target="1026-39-a-2" reftype="term">mortgage loans</ref> it services. Note that reverse mortgages and <ref target="1026-39-a-2" reftype="term">mortgage loans</ref> secured by consumers' interests in timeshare plans, in addition to not being considered in determining small servicer qualification, are also exempt from the requirements of § <ref target="1026-41" reftype="internal">1026.41</ref>. In contrast, although charitably serviced <ref target="1026-39-a-2" reftype="term">mortgage loans</ref>, as defined by § <ref target="1026-41-e-4-iii" reftype="internal">1026.41(e)(4)(iii)</ref>, are likewise not considered in determining small servicer qualification, they are not exempt from the requirements of § <ref target="1026-41" reftype="internal">1026.41</ref>. Thus, a servicer that does not qualify as a small servicer would not have to provide periodic statements for reverse mortgages and timeshare plans because they are exempt from the rule, but would have to provide periodic statements for <ref target="1026-39-a-2" reftype="term">mortgage loans</ref> it charitably services.</content>

      <title>Eligible for purchase, guarantee, or insurance except with regard to matters wholly unrelated to ability to repay.</title>
      <content>To satisfy § <ref target="1026-43-e-4-ii" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(4)(ii)</ref>, a loan need not be actually purchased or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or insured or guaranteed by one of theAgencies (the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), or Rural Housing Service (RHS)). Rather, § <ref target="1026-43-e-4-ii" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(4)(ii)</ref> requires only that the creditor determine that the loan is eligible (i.e., meets the criteria) for such purchase, guarantee, or insurance at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>. For example, for purposes of § <ref target="1026-43-e-4" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(4)</ref>, a creditor is not required to sell a loan to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (or any limited-life regulatory entity succeeding the charter of either) for that loan to be a qualified mortgage; however, the loan must be eligible for purchase or guarantee by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (or any limited-life regulatory entity succeeding the charter of either), including satisfying any requirements regarding consideration and verification of a consumer's income or assets, <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> history, debt-to-income ratio or residual income, and other <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> risk factors, but not any requirements regarding matters wholly unrelated to ability to repay. To determine eligibility for purchase, guarantee or insurance, a creditor may rely on a valid underwriting recommendation provided by a GSE automated underwriting system (AUS) or an AUS that relies on an Agency underwriting tool; compliance with the standards in the GSE or Agency written guide in effect at the time; a written <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreement</ref> between the creditor or a direct sponsor or aggregator of the creditor and a GSE or Agency that permits variation from the standards of the written guides and/or variation from the AUSs, in effect at the time of <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>; or an individual loan waiver granted by the GSE or Agency to the creditor. For creditors relying on the variances of a sponsor or aggregator, a loan that is transferred directly to or through the sponsor or aggregator at or after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> complies with § <ref target="1026-43-e-4" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(4)</ref>. In using any of the four methods listed above, the creditor need not satisfy standards that are wholly unrelated to assessing a consumer's ability to repay that the creditor is required to perform. Matters wholly unrelated to ability to repay are those matters that are wholly unrelated to <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> risk or the underwriting of the loan. Such matters include requirements related to the status of the creditor rather than the loan, requirements related to selling, securitizing, or delivering the loan, and any requirement that the creditor must perform after the consummated loan is sold, guaranteed, or endorsed for insurance such as document custody, quality control, or servicing. Accordingly, a <ref target="1026-42-b-2" reftype="term">covered transaction</ref> is eligible for purchase or guarantee by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, for example, if:</content>

      <title>Repurchase and indemnification demands.</title>
      <content>A repurchase or indemnification demand by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, HUD, VA, USDA, or RHS is not dispositive of qualified mortgage status. Qualified mortgage status under § <ref target="1026-43-e-4" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(4)</ref> depends on whether a loan is eligible to be purchased, guaranteed, or insured at the time of <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, provided that other requirements under § <ref target="1026-43-e-4" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(4)</ref> are satisfied. Some repurchase or indemnification demands are not related to eligibility criteria at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>. See comment 43(e)(4)-4. Further, even where a repurchase or indemnification demand relates to whether the loan satisfied relevant eligibility requirements as of the time of <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, the mere fact that a demand has been made, or even resolved, between a creditor and GSE or agency is not dispositive for purposes of § <ref target="1026-43-e-4" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(4)</ref>. However, evidence of whether a particular loan satisfied the § <ref target="1026-43-e-4" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(4)</ref> eligibility criteria at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> may be brought to light in the course of dealing over a particular demand, depending on the facts and circumstances. Accordingly, each loan should be evaluated by the creditor based on the facts and circumstances relating to the eligibility of that loan at the time of <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>. For example:</content>
      <interpParagraph label="1026-43-e-4-Interp-5-i" marker="i.">
        <content>Assume eligibility to purchase a loan was based in part on the consumer's employment income of $50,000 per year. The creditor uses the income figure in obtaining an approve/eligible recommendation from DU. A quality control review, however, later determines that the documentation provided and verified by the creditor to comply with Fannie Mae requirements did not support the reported income of $50,000 per year. As a result, Fannie Mae demands that the creditor repurchase the loan. Assume that the quality control review is accurate, and that DU would not have issued an approve/eligible recommendation if it had been provided the accurate income figure. The DU determination at the time of <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> was invalid because it was based on inaccurate information provided by the creditor; therefore, the loan was never a qualified mortgage under § <ref target="1026-43-e-4" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(4)</ref>.</content>
      </interpParagraph>
      <interpParagraph label="1026-43-e-4-Interp-5-ii" marker="ii.">
        <content>Assume that a creditor delivered a loan, which the creditor determined was a qualified mortgage at the time of <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> under § <ref target="1026-43-e-4" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(4)</ref>, to Fannie Mae for inclusion in a particular To-Be-Announced Mortgage Backed Security (MBS) pool of loans. The data submitted by the creditor at the time of loan delivery indicated that the various <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan terms</ref> met the product type, weighted-average coupon, weighted-average maturity, and other MBS pooling criteria, and MBS issuance disclosures to investors reflected this loan data. However, after delivery and MBS issuance, a quality control review determines that the loan violates the pooling criteria. The loan still meets eligibility requirements for Fannie Mae products and <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan terms</ref>. Fannie Mae, however, requires the creditor to repurchase the loan due to the violation of MBS pooling requirements. Assume that the quality control review determination is accurate. Because the loan still meets Fannie Mae’s eligibility requirements, it remains a qualified mortgage based on these facts and circumstances. </content>
