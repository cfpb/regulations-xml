  <change operation="modified" label="1026-1-b" subpath="content">
    <content>The purpose of this part is to promote the informed use of <ref target="1026-2-a-12" reftype="term">consumer credit</ref> by requiring disclosures about its terms and cost, to ensure that <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumers</ref> are provided with greater and more timely information on the nature and costs of the residential real estate settlement process, and to effect certain changes in the settlement process for residential real estate that will result in more effective advance disclosure to home buyers and sellers of settlement costs. The regulation also includes substantive protections. It gives <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumers</ref> the right to cancel certain <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> transactions that involve a lien on a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s principal <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>, regulates certain <ref target="1026-2-a-15-i" reftype="term">credit card</ref> practices, and provides a means for fair and timely resolution of <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> billing disputes. The regulation does not generally govern charges for <ref target="1026-2-a-12" reftype="term">consumer credit</ref>, except that several provisions in subpart G set forth special rules addressing certain charges applicable to <ref target="1026-2-a-15-i" reftype="term">credit card</ref> accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) <ref target="1026-2-a-12" reftype="term">consumer credit</ref> plan. The regulation requires a maximum interest rate to be stated in variable-rate contracts secured by the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>. It also imposes limitations on home-equity plans that are subject to the requirements of § <ref target="1026-40" reftype="internal">1026.40</ref> and mortgages that are subject to the requirements of § <ref target="1026-32" reftype="internal">1026.32</ref>. The regulation prohibits certain <ref target="1026-2-a-1" reftype="term">acts</ref> or practices in connection with <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> secured by a <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> in § <ref target="1026-36" reftype="internal">1026.36</ref>, and <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> secured by a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s principal <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> in § <ref target="1026-35" reftype="internal">1026.35</ref>. The regulation also regulates certain practices of <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> who extend <ref target="1026-46-b-5" reftype="term">private education loans</ref> as defined in § <ref target="1026-46-b-5" reftype="internal">1026.46(b)(5)</ref>. In addition, it imposes certain limitations on increases in costs for mortgage transactions subject to § <ref target="1026-19-e" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)</ref> and <ref target="1026-19-f" reftype="internal">(f)</ref>.</content>

Title to the property is conveyed to the land trust for which the financial institution itself is trustee.

    <content>These mortgages involve both a variable interest rate and scheduled variations in payment amounts during the loan term. For example, under these plans, a series of graduated payments may be scheduled before rate adjustments affect payment amounts, or the initial scheduled payment may remain constant for a set period before rate adjustments affect the payment amount. In any case, the initial payment amount may be insufficient to cover the scheduled interest, causing negative amortization from the outset of the transaction.

Information is unknown if it is not reasonably available to the creditor at the time the disclosures are made. The “reasonably available” standard requires that the creditor, acting in good faith, exercise due diligence in obtaining information. For example, the creditor must at a minimum utilize generally accepted calculation tools, but need not invest in the most sophisticated computer program to make a particular type of calculation. The creditor normally may rely on the representations of other parties in obtaining information. For example, the creditor might look to the consumer for the time of consummation, to insurance companies for the cost of insurance, or to realtors for taxes and escrow fees. The creditor may utilize estimates in making disclosures even though the creditor knows that more precise information will be available by the point of consummation. However, new disclosures may be required under § <ref target="1026-17-f" reftype="internal">1026.17(f)</ref> or § <ref target="1026-19" reftype="internal">1026.19</ref>.

For all other disclosures, even though they are based on the same assumption on which a specific estimated disclosure was based, the creditor has flexibility in labeling the estimates. Generally, only the particular disclosure for which the exact information is unknown is labeled as an estimate. However, when several disclosures are affected because of the unknown information, the creditor has the option of labeling either every affected disclosure or only the disclosure primarily affected. For example, when the finance charge is unknown because the date of consummation is unknown, the creditor must label the finance charge as an estimate and may also label as estimates the total of payments and the payment schedule. When many disclosures are estimates, the creditor may use a general statement, such as “all numerical disclosures except the late payment disclosure are estimates,” as a method to label those disclosures as estimates.</content>

  <content>If consumers do not make timely payments in a simple-interest transaction, some of the amounts calculated for Truth in Lending disclosures will differ from amounts that consumers will actually pay over the term of the transaction. Creditors may label disclosures as estimates in these transactions, except as otherwise provided by § <ref target="1026-19" reftype="internal">1026.19</ref>. For example, because the finance charge and total of payments may be larger than disclosed if consumers make late payments, creditors may label the finance charge and total of payments as estimates. On the other hand, creditors may choose not to label disclosures as estimates. In all cases, creditors comply with § <ref target="1026-17-c-2-i" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)(2)(i)</ref> by basing disclosures on the assumption that payments will be made on time and in the amounts required by the terms of the legal obligation, disregarding any possible differences resulting from consumers’ payment patterns.</content>

    <content>Section <ref target="1026-17-c-2-ii" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)(2)(ii)</ref> applies to any numerical amount (such as the finance charge, annual percentage rate, or payment amount) that is affected by the amount of the per-diem interest charge that will be collected at consummation. If the amount of per-diem interest used in preparing the disclosures for consummation is based on the information known to the creditor at the time the disclosure document is prepared, the disclosures are considered accurate under this rule, and affected disclosures are also considered accurate, even if the disclosures are not labeled as estimates. For example, if the amount of per-diem interest used to prepare disclosures is less than the amount of per-diem interest charged at consummation, and as a result the finance charge is understated by $200, the disclosed finance charge is considered accurate even though the understatement is not within the $100 tolerance of § <ref target="1026-18-d-1" reftype="internal">1026.18(d)(1)</ref>, and the finance charge was not labeled as an estimate. In this example, if in addition to the understatement related to the perdiem interest, a $90 fee is incorrectly omitted from the finance charge, causing it to be understated by a total of $290, the finance charge is considered accurate because the $90 fee is within the tolerance in § <ref target="1026-18-d-1" reftype="internal">1026.18(d)(1)</ref>.

Included on the settlement statement are mortgage insurance premiums collected at settlement, which are prepaid finance charges. In calculating the total amount of prepaid finance charges, creditors should use the amount for mortgage insurance listed on the line for mortgage insurance on the settlement statement (line 1003 on HUD–1 or HUD 1–A), without adjustment, even if the actual amount collected at settlement may vary because of RESPA’s escrow accounting rules.

    <content>The creditor may disclose an abbreviated payment schedule when the amount of each regularly scheduled payment (other than the first or last payment) includes an equal amount to be applied on principal and a finance charge computed by application of a rate to the decreasing unpaid balance. In addition, in transactions where payments vary because interest and principal are paid at different intervals, the two series of payments may be disclosed separately and the abbreviated payment schedule may be used for the interest payments. For example, in transactions with fixed quarterly principal payments and monthly interest payments based on the outstanding principal balance, the amount of the interest payments will change quarterly as principal declines. In such cases the creditor may treat the interest and principal payments as two separate series of payments, separately disclosing the number, amount, and due dates of principal payments, and, using the abbreviated payment schedule, the number, amount, and due dates of interest payments. This option may be used when interest and principal are scheduled to be paid on the same date of the month as well as on different dates of the month.

Thus, under the terms of a loan contract providing for monthly interest accrual amortization, if the amount of interest due on May 1 for the preceding month of April is $3,000, the loan contract will require payment of $3,000 in interest for the month of April whether the payment is made on April 20, on May 1, or on May 10. In this example, if the consumer prepays the loan in full on April 20 and if the accrued interest as of that date is $2,000, then assessment of a charge of $3,000 constitutes a prepayment penalty of $1,000 because the amount of interest actually earned through April 20 is only $2,000.</content>

        <content>A fee, such as an origination or other loan closing cost, that is waived by the creditor on the condition that the consumer does not prepay the loan. However, the term prepayment penalty does not include a waived bona fide third-party charge imposed by the creditor if the consumer pays all of a covered transaction’s principal before the date on which the principal is due sooner than 36 months after consummation. For example, assume that at consummation, the creditor waives $3,000 in closing costs to cover bona fide third-party charges but the terms of the loan agreement provide that the creditor may recoup the $3,000 in waived charges if the consumer repays the entire loan balance sooner than 36 months after consummation. The $3,000 charge is not a prepayment penalty. In contrast, for example, assume that at consummation, the creditor waives $3,000 in closing costs to cover bona fide third-party charges but the terms of the loan agreement provide that the creditor may recoup $4,500 in part to recoup waived charges, if the consumer repays the entire loan balance sooner than 36 months after consummation. The $3,000 that the creditor may impose to cover the waived bona fide thirdparty charges is not a prepayment penalty, but the additional $1,500 charge is a prepayment penalty and must be disclosed pursuant to § <ref target="1026-37-k-1" reftype="internal">1026.37(k)(1)</ref>.</content>

      <content>For purposes of § <ref target="1026-18-s" reftype="internal">1026.18(s)</ref>, “mortgage insurance or any functional equivalent” means the amounts identified in § <ref target="1026-4-b-5" reftype="internal">1026.4(b)(5)</ref>. “Mortgage guarantees” (such as a United <ref target="1026-2-a-26" reftype="term">States</ref> Department of Veterans Affairs or United <ref target="1026-2-a-26" reftype="term">States</ref> Department of Agriculture guarantee) provide coverage similar to mortgage insurance, even if not technically considered insurance under <ref target="1026-2-a-26" reftype="term">State</ref> or other applicable law. For purposes of § <ref target="1026-18-s" reftype="internal">1026.18(s)</ref>, “mortgage insurance or any functional equivalent” includes any mortgage guarantee. Payment amounts under § <ref target="1026-18-s-3-i" reftype="internal">1026.18(s)(3)(i)</ref> should reflect the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>’s mortgage insurance payments or any functionally equivalent fee until the date on which the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must automatically terminate coverage under applicable law, even though the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> may have a right to request that the insurance be cancelled earlier. The payment amount must reflect the terms of the legal obligation, as determined by applicable <ref target="1026-2-a-26" reftype="term">State</ref> or other law. For example, assume that under applicable law, mortgage insurance must terminate after the 130th scheduled monthly payment, and the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> collects at closing and places in escrow two months of premiums. If, under the legal obligation, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> will include mortgage insurance premiums in 130 payments and refund the escrowed payments when the insurance is terminated, payment amounts disclosed through the 130th payment should reflect premium payments. If, under the legal obligation, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> will apply the amount escrowed to the two final insurance payments, payments disclosed through the 128th payment should reflect premium payments. The escrow amount reflected on the disclosure should include mortgage insurance premiums even if they are not escrowed and even if there is no escrow account established for the transaction.</content>

    <content>See the commentary under § <ref target="1026-18-s-3-i-C" reftype="internal">1026.18(s)(3)(i)(C)</ref> for guidance on escrows for purposes of § <ref target="1026-18-s-6" reftype="internal">1026.18(s)(6)</ref>. Under that guidance, because mortgage insurance payments and functionally equivalent fees decline over a loan’s term, the payment amounts shown in the table should reflect the mortgage insurance payment and functionally equivalent fees that will be applicable at the time each disclosed periodic payment will be in effect. Accordingly, the disclosed mortgage insurance payment or functionally equivalent fee will be zero if it corresponds to a periodic payment that will occur after the creditor will be legally required to terminate mortgage insurance or any functional equivalent. On the other hand, because only one escrow amount is disclosed under § <ref target="1026-18-s-6" reftype="internal">1026.18(s)(6)</ref> for negative amortization loans and escrows that are not itemized in the payment amounts, the single escrow amount disclosed should reflect the mortgage insurance amount or any functionally equivalent fee that will be collected at the outset of the loan’s term, even though that amount will decline in the future and ultimately will be discontinued pursuant to the terms of the mortgage insurance policy.</content>

                <content>Assume a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> provides a $400 estimate of title fees, which are included in the category of fees which may not increase by more than 10 percent for the purposes of determining good faith under § <ref target="1026-19-e-3-ii" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(3)(ii)</ref>, except as provided in § <ref target="1026-19-e-3-iv" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(3)(iv)</ref>. An unreleased lien is discovered and the title company must perform additional work to release the lien. However, the additional costs amount to only a five percent increase over the sum of all fees included in the category of fees which may not increase by more than 10 percent. A changed circumstance has occurred (i.e., new information), but the sum of all costs subject to the 10 percent tolerance category has not increased by more than 10 percent. Section <ref target="1026-19-e-3-iv" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(3)(iv)</ref> does not prohibit the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> from issuing revised disclosures, but if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> issues revised disclosures in this scenario, when the disclosures required by § <ref target="1026-19-f-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.19(f)(1)(i)</ref> are delivered, the actual title fees of $500 may not be compared to the revised title fees of $500; they must be compared to the originally estimated title fees of $400 because the changed circumstance did not cause the sum of all costs subject to the 10 percent tolerance category to increase by more than 10 percent.</content>

              <title type="keyterm">Changed circumstance.</title>
              <content>A changed circumstance may be an extraordinary event beyond the control of any interested party. For example, a war or a natural disaster would be an extraordinary event beyond the control of an interested party. A changed circumstance may also be an unexpected event specific to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> or the transaction. For example, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> provided an estimate of title insurance on the disclosures required under § <ref target="1026-19-e-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(1)(i)</ref>, but the title insurer goes out of business during underwriting, then this unexpected event specific to the transaction is a changed circumstance. A changed circumstance may also be information specific to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> or transaction that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> relied upon when providing the disclosures required under § <ref target="1026-19-e-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(1)(i)</ref> and that was inaccurate or changed after the disclosures were provided. For example, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> relied on the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>’s income when providing the disclosures required under § <ref target="1026-19-e-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(1)(i)</ref>, and the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> represented to the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> had an annual income of $90,000, but underwriting determines that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>’s annual income is only $80,000, then this inaccuracy in information relied upon is a changed circumstance. Or, assume two co-applicants applied for a <ref target="1026-39-a-2" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref>. One applicant’s income was $30,000, while the other applicant’s income was $50,000. If the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> relied on the combined income of $80,000 when providing the disclosures required under § <ref target="1026-19-e-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(1)(i)</ref>, but the applicant earning $30,000 becomes unemployed during underwriting, thereby reducing the combined income to $50,000, then this change in information relied upon is a changed circumstance. A changed circumstance may also be the discovery of new information specific to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> or transaction that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> did not rely on when providing the original disclosures required under § <ref target="1026-19-e-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(1)(i)</ref>. For example, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> relied upon the value of the property in providing the disclosures required under § <ref target="1026-19-e-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(1)(i)</ref>, but during underwriting a neighbor of the seller, upon learning of the impending sale of the property, files a claim contesting the boundary of the property to be sold, then this new information specific to the transaction is a changed circumstance.</content>

For example, assume that, prior to providing the disclosures required by § <ref target="1026-19-e-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(1)(i)</ref>, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> believed that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> was eligible for a loan program that did not require an appraisal. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> then provides the estimated disclosures required by § <ref target="1026-19-e-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(1)(i)</ref>, which do not include an estimated charge for an appraisal. During underwriting it is discovered that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> was delinquent on <ref target="1026-39-a-2" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref> payments in the past, making the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> ineligible for the loan program originally identified on the estimated disclosures, but the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> remains eligible for a different program that requires an appraisal. If the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> provides revised disclosures reflecting the new program and including the appraisal fee, then the actual appraisal fee will be compared to the appraisal fee included in the revised disclosures to determine if the actual fee has increased above the estimated fee. However, if the revised disclosures also include increased estimates for title fees, the actual title fees must be compared to the original estimates assuming that the increased title fees do not stem from the change in eligibility or any other change warranting a revised disclosure.

The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> had received information three weeks before that, because of a changed circumstance under § <ref target="1026-19-e-3-iv-A" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(A)</ref>, the pest inspection fees increased by an amount totaling five percent of the originally estimated settlement charges subject to § <ref target="1026-19-e-3-ii" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(3)(ii)</ref>.

              <content>Assume a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> requires an appraisal.

However, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> has reason to doubt the validity of the appraisal report.

The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> then chooses to send a different appraiser for a second opinion, but the second appraiser returns a similar report. At this point, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> has received information sufficient to establish that a reason for revision has, in fact, occurred, and must provide corrected disclosures within three <ref target="1026-2-a-6" reftype="term">business days</ref> of receiving the second appraisal report.

              <content>An actual term is unknown if it is not reasonably available to the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> at the time the disclosures are made. The “reasonably available” standard requires that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>, acting in good faith, exercise due diligence in obtaining the information. For example, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must at a minimum utilize generally accepted calculation tools, but need not invest in the most sophisticated computer program to make a particular type of calculation. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> normally may rely on the representations of other parties in obtaining information. For example, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> might look to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> for the time of <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, to insurance companies for the cost of insurance, to realtors for taxes and escrow fees, or to a settlement agent for homeowner’s association dues or other information in connection with a real estate settlement.

See comment 19(f)(1)(iii)–1.

            <content><ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">Creditors</ref> using average charges must ensure that the total amount paid by or imposed on <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumers</ref> for a service does not exceed the total amount paid to the providers of that service for the particular class of transactions. A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may find that, even though it developed an averagecost pricing program in accordance with the requirements of § <ref target="1026-19-f-3-ii" reftype="internal">1026.19(f)(3)(ii)</ref>, over time it has collected more from <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumers</ref> than it has paid to <ref target="1026-42-d-5-ii" reftype="term">settlement service</ref> providers. For example, assume a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> defines a class of transactions and uses that class to develop an average charge of $135 for pest inspections. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> then charges $135 per transaction for 100 transactions from January 1 through April 30, but the actual average cost to the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> of pest inspections during this period is $115. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> then decreases the average charge for the May to August period to account for the lower average cost during the January to April period. At this point, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> has collected $2,000 more than it has paid to <ref target="1026-42-d-5-ii" reftype="term">settlement service</ref> providers for pest inspections. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> then charges $115 per transaction for 70 transactions from May 1 to August 30, but the actual average cost to the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> of pest inspections during this period is $125. Based on the average cost to the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> from the May to August period, the average charge to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> for the September to December period should be $125. However, while the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> spent $700 more than it collected during the May to August period, it collected $1,300 more than it spent from January to August. In cases such as these, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> remains responsible for ensuring that the amount collected from <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumers</ref> does not exceed the total amounts paid for the corresponding <ref target="1026-42-b-1" reftype="term">settlement services</ref> over time. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may develop a variety of methods that achieve this outcome. For example, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may choose to refund the proportional overage paid to the affected <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumers</ref>. Or the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may choose to factor in the excess amount collected to decrease the average charge for an upcoming period. Although any method may comply with this requirement, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is deemed to have complied if it defines a six-month time period and establishes a rolling monthly period of reevaluation. For example, assume a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> defines a six-month time period from January 1 to June 30 and the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> uses the average charge starting July 1. If, at the end of July, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> recalculates the average cost from February 1 to July 31, and then uses the recalculated average cost for transactions starting August 1, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> complies with the requirements of § <ref target="1026-19-f-3-ii" reftype="internal">1026.19(f)(3)(ii)</ref>, even if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> actually collected more from <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumers</ref> than was paid to providers over time.</content>

            <content>A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may prospectively adjust average charges if it develops a statistically reliable and accurate method for doing so. For example, assume a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> calculates average charges based on two time periods: winter (October 1 to March 31), and summer (April 1 to September 30).

For example, an average charge may not be used for a transfer tax if the transfer tax is calculated as a percentage of the loan amount or property value.

The documentation must support the components and methods of calculation. For example, if a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> calculates an average charge for a particular county recording fee by simply averaging all of the relevant fees paid in the prior month, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> need only retain the receipts for the individual recording fees, a ledger demonstrating that the total amount received did not exceed the total amount paid over time, and a document detailing the calculation.

Section <ref target="1026-19-f-4-i" reftype="internal">1026.19(f)(4)(i)</ref> requires disclosure of the items that relate to the seller’s transaction.

        <content>The disclosures required by § <ref target="1026-37" reftype="internal">1026.37</ref> are required to reflect the terms of the legal obligation between the parties, and if any information necessary for an accurate disclosure is unknown to the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> shall make the disclosure in good faith, based on the best information reasonably available to the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> pursuant to §§ <ref target="1026-17-c" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)</ref> and <ref target="1026-19-e" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)</ref>. See comments 17(c)(1)– 1, 17(c)(2)(i)–1 and –2, and 19(e)(1)(i)–1. Where a disclosure is not applicable to a particular transaction, unless otherwise provided by § <ref target="1026-37" reftype="internal">1026.37</ref>, form H–24 of appendix H to this part may not be modified to delete the disclosure from form H–24, or to state “not applicable” or “N/A” in place of such disclosure. The portion of the form pertaining to the inapplicable disclosure may be left blank, unless otherwise provided by § <ref target="1026-37" reftype="internal">1026.37</ref>. For example, in a transaction for which the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> does not pay points to the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> to reduce the interest rate, the amounts required to be disclosed by § <ref target="1026-37-f-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.37(f)(1)(i)</ref> may be left blank on form H–24. As provided in § <ref target="1026-37-i" reftype="internal">1026.37(i)</ref> and (j), however, the adjustable payment and adjustable interest rate tables required by those paragraphs may be included only if those disclosures are applicable to the transaction and otherwise must be excluded.</content>

              <content>When disclosing an adjustable rate product, the disclosure of the loan product must be preceded by the length of the introductory period and the frequency of the first adjustment period thereafter.

              <content>Some loan products, such as “payment option” loans, permit the borrower to make payments that are insufficient to cover all of the interest accrued, and the unpaid interest is added to the principal balance.

              <content>A charge determined by treating the loan balance as outstanding for a period of time after prepayment in full and applying the interest rate to such “balance,” even if the charge results from interest accrual amortization used for other payments in the transaction under the terms of the loan contract. “Interest accrual amortization” refers to the method by which the amount of interest due for each period (e.g., month) in a transaction’s term is determined. For example, “monthly interest accrual amortization” treats each payment as made on the scheduled, monthly due date even if it is actually paid early or late (until the expiration of any <ref target="1026-54-a-2" reftype="term">grace period</ref>). Thus, under the terms of a loan contract providing for monthly interest accrual amortization, if the amount of interest due on May 1 for the preceding month of April is $3,000, the loan contract will require payment of $3,000 in interest for the month of April whether the payment is made on April 20, on May 1, or on May 10. In this example, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> prepays the loan in full on April 20 and if the accrued interest as of that date is $2,000, then assessment of a charge of $3,000 constitutes a <ref target="1026-32-b-6-i" reftype="term">prepayment penalty</ref> of $1,000 because the amount of interest actually earned through April 20 is only $2,000.</content>

For a loan with no lifetime interest rate cap, the maximum rate is determined by reference to other applicable laws, such as <ref target="1026-2-a-26" reftype="term">State</ref> usury law. In disclosing the minimum payment for purposes of § <ref target="1026-37-c" reftype="internal">1026.37(c)</ref>, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> assumes that the interest rate will decrease as rapidly as possible after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, taking into account any <ref target="1026-16-g-2-ii" reftype="term">introductory rates</ref>, caps on interest rate adjustments, and lifetime interest rate floor.

              <title type="keyterm">Special rule for adjustable rate loans with negative amortization features.</title>
              <content>Section <ref target="1026-37-c-2-i-B" reftype="internal">1026.37(c)(2)(i)(B)</ref> provides a special rule for calculation of the maximum principal and interest payment in an adjustable rate loan that contains a <ref target="1026-18-s-7-v" reftype="term">negative amortization</ref> feature. That section provides that the maximum amounts payable for principal and interest after the <ref target="1026-18-s-7-v" reftype="term">negative amortization</ref> period ends are calculated using the maximum principal amount permitted under the terms of the legal obligation at the end of the <ref target="1026-18-s-7-v" reftype="term">negative amortization</ref> period. See section § <ref target="1026-37-c-1-i-A" reftype="internal">1026.37(c)(1)(i)(A)</ref> and associated commentary for guidance regarding when the <ref target="1026-18-s-7-v" reftype="term">negative amortization</ref> period ends for purposes of § <ref target="1026-37-c-2" reftype="internal">1026.37(c)(2)</ref>. For example, if the maximum principal balance for the last payment in the <ref target="1026-18-s-7-v" reftype="term">negative amortization</ref> period is achieved at an interest rate that is not the maximum interest rate permitted under the terms of the legal obligation before the <ref target="1026-18-s-7-v" reftype="term">negative amortization</ref> period ends, future events requiring disclosure of additional, separate periodic payments or ranges of payments assume that the interest rate in effect at the end of the <ref target="1026-18-s-7-v" reftype="term">negative amortization</ref> period was such interest rate, and not the maximum possible interest rate. After the end of the <ref target="1026-18-s-7-v" reftype="term">negative amortization</ref> period, the general rule under § <ref target="1026-37-c-2-i-A" reftype="internal">1026.37(c)(2)(i)(A)</ref> regarding assumptions of interest rate changes for the maximum principal and interest payment to be disclosed applies from such interest rate. The minimum payment in an adjustable rate loan that contains a <ref target="1026-18-s-7-v" reftype="term">negative amortization</ref> feature is determined pursuant to the general rule under § <ref target="1026-37-c-2-i-A" reftype="internal">1026.37(c)(2)(i)(A)</ref>.</content>

For example, for a balloon payment amount that can change depending on previous interest rate adjustments that are based on the value of an index at the time of the adjustment, the balloon payment amounts are calculated using the assumptions for minimum and maximum interest rates described in § <ref target="1026-37-c-2-i" reftype="internal">1026.37(c)(2)(i)</ref> and its commentary, and should be disclosed as a range of payments.</content>

            <content>For a seasonal payment product with a unit-period of a month that does not require periodic payments for the months of June, July, and August each year during the loan term, because such feature depends on calendar months and not on when regular periodic payments begin, the period is disclosed as “from June to August.” For a transaction with a quarterly unit-period that does not require a periodic payment every third quarter during the loan term and does not depend on calendar months, the period is disclosed as “every third payment.” In the same transaction, if the seasonal payment feature ends after the 20th quarter, the period is disclosed as “every quarter until the 20th quarter.” As described above in this comment 37(i)–2, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may abbreviate “quarter” to “quart.” or “Q.”</content>

If there is only one adjustment of the periodic payment under the terms of the legal obligation (for example, if the loan has an interest only period for the first 60 payments and there are no adjustments to the payment after the end of the interest only period), the disclosure should state: “No subsequent changes.” If the loan has graduated increases in the regular periodic payment every 12th payment, the disclosure should state: “Every year.” If the frequency of adjustments to the periodic payment may change under the terms of the legal obligation, the disclosure should state the smallest period of adjustments that may occur.

If the disclosed payment is scheduled, § <ref target="1026-37-i-5" reftype="internal">1026.37(i)(5)</ref> requires that the disclosure state the payment number when such payment is reached with the preceding text, “starting at.” If the disclosed payment is only potential, as may be the case for a loan that permits optional payments, the disclosure states the earliest payment number when such payment can be reached with the preceding text, “as early as.” Section <ref target="1026-37-i-5" reftype="internal">1026.37(i)(5)</ref> requires that the first possible periodic principal and interest payment that can reach the maximum be disclosed. For example, for a fixed interest rate optional-payment loan with scheduled payments that result in <ref target="1026-18-s-7-v" reftype="term">negative amortization</ref> under the terms of the legal obligation, the maximum periodic payment disclosed should be based on the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> having elected to make the periodic payments that would increase the principal balance to the maximum amount at the latest time possible before the loan begins to fully amortize, which would cause the periodic principal and interest payment to be the maximum possible. For example, if the earliest payment that could reach the maximum principal balance was the 41st payment at which time the loan would begin to amortize and the periodic principal and interest payment would be recalculated, but the last payment that permitted the principal balance to increase was the 60th payment, the disclosure required by § <ref target="1026-37-i-5" reftype="internal">1026.37(i)(5)</ref> must assume the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> only reaches the maximum principal balance at the 60th payment because this would result in the maximum possible principal and interest payment under the terms of the legal obligation.

In many cases, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> cannot determine, at the time the disclosure is made, whether a loan may be assumable at a future date on its original terms. For example, the assumption clause commonly used in mortgages sold to the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation conditions an assumption on a variety of factors, such as the creditworthiness of the subsequent borrower, the potential for impairment of the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>’s security, and the execution of an assumption <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreement</ref> by the subsequent borrower.

              <content>The clear and conspicuous standard requires that the disclosures required by § <ref target="1026-37" reftype="internal">1026.37</ref> be legible and in a readily understandable form. Section <ref target="1026-37-o-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.37(o)(1)(i)</ref> requires that the disclosures be grouped together and segregated from everything else. For example, <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> may not add additional pages in between the pages of the Loan Estimate, or attach to the Loan Estimate additional pages that are not provided for under § <ref target="1026-37" reftype="internal">1026.37</ref> after the last page of the Loan Estimate. As required by § <ref target="1026-37-o-3-i" reftype="internal">1026.37(o)(3)(i)</ref>, the disclosures for any transaction that is a federally related <ref target="1026-39-a-2" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref> under Regulation X, 12 CFR 1024.2, must be made using the standard form H–24 of appendix H to this part. Accordingly, use of that form constitutes compliance with the clear and conspicuous and segregation requirements of § <ref target="1026-37-o" reftype="internal">1026.37(o)</ref>. In addition, § <ref target="1026-37-o-1-ii" reftype="internal">1026.37(o)(1)(ii)</ref> requires <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> to disclose on the Loan Estimate only the information required by § <ref target="1026-37-a" reftype="internal">1026.37(a)</ref> through (n), except as otherwise provided by § <ref target="1026-37-o" reftype="internal">1026.37(o)</ref>, and in the same order, and positioned relative to the master headings, headings, subheadings, labels, and similar designations in the same manner, as shown in form H–24, set forth in appendix H to this part. For example, <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> may not use form H–24, but include in the Loan Terms table under the subheading “Can this amount increase after closing?” information that is not required by § <ref target="1026-37-b-6" reftype="internal">1026.37(b)(6)</ref>.</content>

Such transactions may have some of the characteristics of lease transactions subject to Regulation M (12 CFR part 1013), but are considered credit transactions where the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> assumes the indicia of ownership, including the risks, burdens, and benefits of ownership, upon <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>.

These statements are more prominent than the other disclosures under § <ref target="1026-38-e" reftype="internal">1026.38(e)</ref>. The statement of whether the estimated and final amounts are different, stated as a “Yes” or “No” in capital letters and in boldface, under the subheading “Did this change?,” as shown on forms H– 25(E) and H–25(G) of appendix H to this part, complies with the requirement to state whether the amounts are different more prominently. Such statement of “No” satisfies the requirement to state that the estimated and final amounts are equal, and these sections do not provide for any narrative text to be included with such statement. The prominence requirement also requires that, in the event an increase or decrease in costs has occurred, certain words within the narrative text to be included under the subheading “Did this change?” for a “Yes” answer are displayed more prominently than other disclosures. For example, under § <ref target="1026-38-e-2-iii-A" reftype="internal">1026.38(e)(2)(iii)(A)</ref>, this more prominent statement could take the form of the phrases “Total Loan Costs (D)” and “Total Other Costs (I)” being shown in boldface, as shown on forms H–25(E) and H–25(G) of appendix H to this part. See comment 38(e)–4 for further guidance regarding the prominence of such statements.</content>

          <content>The dollar amounts disclosed under § <ref target="1026-38" reftype="internal">1026.38</ref> generally are shown to two decimal places unless otherwise required. See comment 38(t)(4)–1. As a result, any “Final” amount that is disclosed in the alternative “Calculating Cash to Close” table under § <ref target="1026-38-e" reftype="internal">1026.38(e)</ref> is shown to two decimal places unless otherwise required. Pursuant to § <ref target="1026-38-t-4-i-C" reftype="internal">1026.38(t)(4)(i)(C)</ref>, however, any “Loan Estimate” amount that is disclosed in the alternative “Calculating Cash to Close” table under § <ref target="1026-38-e" reftype="internal">1026.38(e)</ref> is shown to the nearest dollar amount, and thus matches the corresponding estimated amount disclosed on the Loan Estimate’s “Calculating Cash to Close” table under § <ref target="1026-37-h" reftype="internal">1026.37(h)</ref>, which is shown to the nearest whole dollar pursuant to § <ref target="1026-37-o-4-i-A" reftype="internal">1026.37(o)(4)(i)(A)</ref>. For this reason, a “Final” amount shown to two decimal places could be a larger number than its corresponding “Estimate” amount shown to the nearest whole dollar, when, in fact, the apparent increase is due solely to rounding. Therefore, for purposes of § <ref target="1026-38-e-1-iii" reftype="internal">1026.38(e)(1)(iii)</ref>, (2)(iii), (3)(iii), and (4)(iii), each statement of a change between the amounts disclosed on the Loan Estimate and the Closing Disclosure is based on the actual, nonrounded estimate that would have been disclosed on the Loan Estimate under § <ref target="1026-37-h" reftype="internal">1026.37(h)</ref> if it had been shown to two decimal places rather than a whole dollar amount. For example, if the “Loan Estimate” amount of “Total Closing Costs” disclosed under § <ref target="1026-38-e-2-i" reftype="internal">1026.38(e)(2)(i)</ref> is $12,500, and the “Final” amount of “Total Closing Costs” disclosed under § <ref target="1026-38-e-2-ii" reftype="internal">1026.38(e)(2)(ii)</ref> is $12,500.35, then even though the table would appear to show a $0.35 increase in “Total Closing Costs,” no statement of such increase is given under § <ref target="1026-38-e-2-iii" reftype="internal">1026.38(e)(2)(iii)</ref> so long as the actual, non-rounded estimate (i.e., the estimated amount of “Total Closing Costs” that would have been shown on the Loan Estimate to two decimal places) is equal to $12,500.35.</content>

These statements are more prominent than the other disclosures under § <ref target="1026-38-i" reftype="internal">1026.38(i)</ref>. The statement of whether the estimated and final amounts are different, stated as a “Yes” or “No” in capital letters and in boldface font, under the subheading “Did this change?,” as shown on form H–25 of appendix H to this part, complies with the requirement to state whether the amounts are different more prominently. Such statement of “No” satisfies the requirement to state that the estimated and final amounts are equal, and these sections do not provide for any narrative text to be included with such statement. The prominence requirement also requires that, in the event an increase or decrease in costs has occurred, certain words within the narrative text to be included under the subheading “Did this change?” for a “Yes” answer are displayed more prominently than other disclosures. For example, under § <ref target="1026-38-i-1-iii-A" reftype="internal">1026.38(i)(1)(iii)(A)</ref>, this more prominent statement could take the form of the phrases “Total Loan Costs” and “Total Other Costs” being shown in boldface, as shown on form H–25 of appendix H to this part.

            <content>The dollar amounts disclosed under § <ref target="1026-38" reftype="internal">1026.38</ref> generally are shown to two decimal places unless otherwise required. See comment 38(t)(4)–1. As a result, any “Final” amount that is disclosed in the “Calculating Cash to Close” table under § <ref target="1026-38-i" reftype="internal">1026.38(i)</ref> is shown to two decimal places unless otherwise required. Pursuant to § <ref target="1026-38-t-4-i-C" reftype="internal">1026.38(t)(4)(i)(C)</ref>, however, any “Loan Estimate” amount that is disclosed in the “Calculating Cash to Close” table under § <ref target="1026-38-i" reftype="internal">1026.38(i)</ref> is shown rounded to the nearest dollar amount, and thus matches the corresponding estimated amount disclosed on the Loan Estimate’s “Calculating Cash to Close” table under § <ref target="1026-37-h" reftype="internal">1026.37(h)</ref>, which is shown rounded to the nearest whole dollar pursuant to § <ref target="1026-37-o-4-i-A" reftype="internal">1026.37(o)(4)(i)(A)</ref>. For this reason, a “Final” amount shown to two decimal places could be a larger number than its corresponding “Loan Estimate” amount shown rounded to the nearest whole dollar, when, in fact, the apparent increase is due solely to rounding. Therefore, for purposes of § <ref target="1026-38-i-1-iii" reftype="internal">1026.38(i)(1)(iii)</ref>, (2)(iii), (3)(iii), (4)(iii), (5)(iii), (6)(iii), (7)(iii), and (8)(iii), each statement of a change between the amounts disclosed on the Loan Estimate and the Closing Disclosure is based on the actual, nonrounded estimate that would have been disclosed on the Loan Estimate under § <ref target="1026-37-h" reftype="internal">1026.37(h)</ref> if it had been shown to two decimal places rather than a whole dollar amount. For example, if the “Loan Estimate” amount of “Total Closing Costs” disclosed under § <ref target="1026-38-i-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.38(i)(1)(i)</ref> is $12,500, and the “Final” amount of “Total Closing Costs” disclosed under § <ref target="1026-38-i-1-ii" reftype="internal">1026.38(i)(1)(ii)</ref> is $12,500.35, then even though the table would appear to show a $0.35 increase in “Total Closing Costs,” no statement of such increase is given under § <ref target="1026-38-i-1-iii" reftype="internal">1026.38(i)(1)(iii)</ref> so long as the actual, non-rounded estimate (i.e., the estimated amount of “Total Closing Costs” that would have been shown on the Loan Estimate to two decimal places) is equal to $12,500.35.</content>

The NMLSR ID is a unique number or other identifier that is generally assigned by the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System &amp; Registry (NMLSR) to individuals registered or licensed through NMLSR to provide loan originating services (for more information, see the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (SAFE Act) sections 1503(3) and (12) and 1504, 12 U.S.C. 5102(3) and (12) and 5103, and its implementing regulations (i.e., 12 CFR 1007.103(a) and <ref target="CFR:12-1008-103-a-2" reftype="external">1008.103(a)(2)</ref>). An entity may also have an NMLSR ID.

    <content>On the other hand, if the creditor elects to disclose the construction and permanent phases as a single transaction, where interest is payable on the amount actually advanced for the time it is outstanding, the construction phase must be disclosed pursuant to appendix D, part II.C.1, which provides that the creditor shall disclose the repayment schedule without reflecting the number or amounts of payments of interest only that are made during the construction phase. Appendix D also provides, however, that creditors must disclose (outside of the table) the fact that interest payments must be made and the timing of such payments. The interest rate and payment summary table disclosed under § <ref target="1026-18-s" reftype="internal">1026.18(s)</ref> in such cases must reflect only the permanent phase of the transaction.

Proposed section 1026.25(c)(2) would have: (1) Extended the time period for retention by creditors of compensation-related records from two years to three years; (2) required loan originator organizations (i.e., generally, mortgage broker companies) to maintain certain compensation-related records for three years; and (3) clarified the types of compensation-related records that are required to be maintained under the rule. Proposed § 1026.25(c)(3) would have required creditors to maintain records evidencing compliance with the requirements related to discount points and origination points or fees set forth in proposed § 1026.36(d)(2)(ii).</analysisParagraph>

        <title>25(a) General Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Existing comment 25(a)-5 clarifies the nature of the record retention requirements under § 1026.25 as applied to Regulation Z's loan originator compensation provisions. The comment provides that, for each transaction subject to the loan originator compensation provisions in § 1026.36(d)(1), a creditor should maintain records of the compensation it provided to the loan originator for the transaction as well as the compensation agreement in effect on the date the interest rate was set for the transaction. The comment also states that where a loan originator is a mortgage broker, a disclosure of compensation or other broker agreement required by applicable State law that complies with § 1026.25 is presumed to be a record of the amount actually paid to the loan originator in connection with the transaction.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed new § 1026.25(c)(2), which sets forth certain new record retention requirements for compensation paid to loan originators, as discussed below. The Bureau also proposed new comments 25(c)(2)-1 and -2, which incorporate substantially the same interpretations as existing comment 25(a)-5. For the sake of improved organization of the commentary and to prevent duplication, the Bureau proposed to remove existing comment 25(a)-5. No substantive change was intended by this proposal. The Bureau received no public comments on the proposal to remove comment 25(a)-5. Therefore, this final rule is removing comment 25(a)-5 as unnecessary, consistent with the proposed rule.</analysisParagraph>

          <title>Three-Year Record Retention</title>
          <analysisParagraph>TILA does not contain requirements to retain specific records, but § 1026.25 requires creditors to retain evidence of compliance with Regulation Z for two years after the date disclosures are required to be made or action is required to be taken. Section 1404 of the Dodd-Frank Act amended TILA section 129B, which imposes substantive restrictions on loan originator compensation and provides civil liability for any mortgage originator for failure to comply with the requirements of TILA section 129B and any of its implementing regulations. 15 U.S.C. 1639b(d). Section 1416(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act amended section 130(e) of TILA to provide a three-year limitations period for civil actions alleging a violation of certain sections of TILA, including section 129B concerning loan originator compensation, beginning on the date of the occurrence of the violation. 15 U.S.C. 1640(e). Prior to amendment by the Dodd-Frank Act, the limitations period for individual actions alleging violations of TILA was generally one year. 15 U.S.C. 1640(e) (2008). In view of the statutory changes to TILA, the provisions of existing § 1026.25, which impose a two-year record retention period, do not reflect the applicable limitations period for causes of action that may be brought under TILA section 129B. Moreover, the record retention provisions in § 1026.25 currently are limited to creditors, whereas the compensation restrictions in TILA section 129B, as added by the Dodd-Frank Act, cover all mortgage originators and not solely creditors.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>To reflect these statutory changes, the Bureau proposed § 1026.25(c)(2), which would have made two changes to the existing record retention provisions. First, the proposed rule would have required that a creditor maintain records sufficient to evidence the compensation it pays to a loan originator and the governing compensation agreement, for three years after the date of payment. Second, the proposed rule would have required a loan originator organization to maintain for three years records of the compensation: (1) It receives from a creditor, a consumer, or another person; and (2) it pays to any individual loan originators. The loan originator organization also must maintain the compensation agreement that governs those receipts or payments for three years after the date of the receipts or payments. The Bureau proposed these changes pursuant to its authority under section 105(a) of TILA to prevent circumvention or evasion of TILA by requiring records that can be used to establish compliance. The Bureau stated its belief that these proposed modifications would ensure records associated with loan originator compensation are retained for a time period commensurate with the statute of limitations for causes of action under TILA section 130 and are readily available for examination. In addition, the Bureau stated its belief that the modifications are necessary to prevent circumvention of and to facilitate compliance with TILA.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau recognized that increasing the period a creditor must retain records for specific information related to loan originator compensation from two years, as currently provided in Regulation Z, to three years may impose some marginal increase in the creditor's compliance burden in the form of incremental cost of storage. The Bureau stated its belief, however, that creditors should be able to use existing recordkeeping systems to maintain the records for an additional year at minimal cost. Similarly, although loan originator organizations would incur some costs to establish and maintain recordkeeping systems, the Bureau expected that loan originator organizations would be able to adopt at minimal cost their existing recordkeeping systems to serve these newly required purposes. During the Small Business Review Panel, the Small Entity Representatives were asked about their current record retention practices and the potential impact of the proposed enhanced record retention requirements. Of the few Small Entity Representatives that provided feedback on the issue, one creditor Small Entity Representative stated that it maintained detailed records of compensation paid to all of its employees and that a regulator already reviews its compensation plans regularly. Another creditor Small Entity Representative reported that it did not believe that the proposed record retention requirement would require it to change its current practices.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau recognized that applying the existing two-year record retention period to information specified in § 1026.25(c)(2) could adversely affect the ability of consumers to bring actions under TILA. As the Bureau stated in the proposal, the extension also would serve to reduce litigation risk and maintain consistency between creditors and loan originator organizations. The Bureau therefore believed that it was appropriate to expand the time period for record retention to effectuate the three-year statute of limitations period established by Congress for actions against loan originators under section 129B of TILA.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Most commenters agreed that extending the retention period from two years to three years would not significantly increase the cost of compliance. Though some commenters opined that the changes in § 1026.25(c) would significantly increase their compliance burden, those comments appeared to be directed to the proposed record retention provisions related to proposed restrictions on discount points and origination points or fees in proposed § 1026.36(d)(2)(ii). Because the Bureau is not finalizing in this rule the points and fees proposal (or the attendant record retention requirement), the additional record retention requirement imposed by this final rule is minimal.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau invited public comment on whether a record retention period of five years, rather than three years, would be appropriate. The Bureau explained that relevant actions and compensation practices that must be evidenced in retained records may in some cases occur prior to the beginning of the three-year period of enforceability that applies to a particular transaction. In addition, the running of the three-year period may be tolled under some circumstances, resulting in a period of enforceability that ends more than three years following an occurrence of a violation of applicable requirements. Accordingly, the proposal stated that a record retention period that is longer than three years may help ensure that consumers are able to avail themselves of TILA protections while imposing minimal incremental burden on creditors and loan originators. The Bureau noted that many State and local laws related to transactions involving real property may set a record retention period, or may depend on the information being available, for five years. Additionally, a five-year record retention period would be consistent with proposed provisions in the Bureau's 2012 TILA-RESPA Proposal.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Most commenters objected to a five-year record retention period as overly burdensome. In addition, the implementing regulations of the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) require that there be a showing of “substantial need” to impose a record retention requirement of longer than three years. 5 CFR 1320.5(d)(2)(iv). Given the PRA's preference for retention periods of three years or less, the Bureau is adopting § 1026.25(c)(2)'s three-year retention period as proposed, notwithstanding some of the noted advantages of a longer retention period.<footnote ref="56">The language of § 1025(c)(2)(i) is revised slightly from the proposal for the sake of simplicity. The proposal would have required a creditor to maintain records reflecting compensation paid to “a loan originator organization or the creditor's individual loan originators.” The final rule requires a creditor to maintain records reflecting compensation paid “to a loan originator, as defined in § 1026.36(a)(1).” No substantive change is intended.</footnote>

          <title>Application to Loan Originator Organizations</title>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau stated in the proposal that it would be necessary to require both creditors and loan originator organizations to retain for three years evidence of compliance with the requirements of § 1026.36(d)(1). Although creditors would retain some of the records needed to demonstrate compliance with TILA section 129B and its implementing regulations, in some circumstances, the records would be available solely from the loan originator organization. For example, if a creditor compensates a loan originator organization for originating a transaction and the loan originator organization in turn allocates a portion of that compensation to an individual loan originator as a commission, the creditor may not possess a copy of the commission agreement setting forth the arrangement between the loan originator organization and the individual loan originator or any record of the payment of the commission. The Bureau stated that applying this requirement to both creditors and loan originator organizations would prevent circumvention of and facilitate compliance with TILA, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive any comments regarding the extension of the record retention requirements to loan originator organizations. Because the Bureau continues to believe that requiring loan originator organizations to retain records related to compensation will facilitate compliance with TILA, the Bureau is adopting § 1026.25(c)(2)'s applicability to loan originator organizations as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

          <title>Exclusion of Individual Loan Originators</title>
          <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1026.25(c)(2) would not have applied Regulation Z recordkeeping requirements to individual loan originators. Although section 129B(d) of TILA, as added by the Dodd-Frank Act, permits consumers to bring actions against mortgage originators (which include individual loan originators), the Bureau stated its belief that applying the record retention requirements of § 1026.25 to individual loan originators is unnecessary. Under § 1026.25 as proposed, loan originator organizations and creditors would have been required to retain certain records regarding all of their individual loan originators. The preamble stated that applying the same record retention requirements to the individual loan originator employees themselves would be duplicative. In addition, such a requirement might not be feasible in all cases, because individual loan originators might not have access to the types of records required to be retained under § 1026.25, particularly after they cease to be employed by the creditor or loan originator organization. Under the proposal, an individual loan originator who is a sole proprietor, however, would have been responsible for compliance with provisions that apply to the proprietorship (which is a loan originator organization) and, as a result, is responsible for compliance with the record retention requirements. Similarly, a natural person who is a creditor would have been subject to the requirements that apply to creditors.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comments on the exclusion of individual loan originators. For the reasons discussed above, the Bureau is adopting § 1026.25(c)(2) without making it applicable to individual loan originators, as proposed. The Bureau notes that while the preamble to the proposal discussed individual loan originator employees, the exclusion applies to all individual loan originators, as that term is defined in § 1026.36(a)(1), whether or not employees.</analysisParagraph>

          <title>Substance of Record Retention Requirements</title>
          <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, proposed § 1026.25(c)(2) would have made two changes to the existing record retention provisions. First, § 1026.25(c)(2)(i) would have required a creditor to maintain for three years records sufficient to evidence all compensation it pays to a loan originator and a copy of the governing compensation agreement. Second, § 1026.25(c)(2)(ii) would have required a loan originator organization to maintain for three years records of all compensation that it receives from a creditor, a consumer, or another person or that it pays to its individual loan originators and a copy of the compensation agreement that governs those receipts or payments.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 25(c)(2)-1.i would have clarified that, under § 1026.25(c)(2), records are sufficient to evidence that compensation was paid and received if they demonstrate facts enumerated in the comment. The comment gives examples of the types of records that, depending on the facts and circumstances, may be sufficient to evidence compliance. One commenter expressed concern that the comment could be read to require retention of all records listed; however, the comment clearly states that the records listed are examples only and what records would be sufficient would be dependent on the facts and circumstances and would vary on a case-by-case basis. To prevent any uncertainty, however, the comment is clarified to describe which records might be sufficient depending on the type of compensation at issue in certain circumstances. For example, the comment explains that, for compensation in the form of a contribution to or benefit under a designated tax-advantaged retirement plan, records to be maintained might include copies of required filings under other applicable statutes relating to such plans, copies of the plan and amendments thereto and the names of any loan originators covered by such plans, or determination letters from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regarding such plans. The Bureau is also clarifying the comment by removing the reference to certain agreements being “presumed” to be a record of the amount of compensation actually paid to the loan originator. Instead, as revised, the comment provides that such agreements are a record of the amount actually paid to the loan originator unless actual compensation deviates from the amount in the disclosure or agreement.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is further revising comment 25(c)(2)-1.i to indicate that if compensation has been decreased to defray the cost, in whole or part, of an unforeseen increase in an actual settlement cost over an estimated settlement cost disclosed to the consumer pursuant to section 5(c) of RESPA (or omitted from that disclosure), records to be maintained are those documenting the decrease in compensation and the reasons for it. This revision corresponds with changes to the commentary to § 1026.36(d)(1) clarifying that the section prohibits a loan originator from reducing its compensation to bear the cost of a change in transaction terms except to defray such unforeseen increases in settlement cost. Retaining these records will allow for agency examination about whether a particular decrease in loan originator compensation is truly based on unforeseen increases to settlement costs, i.e., whether it indicates a pattern or practice of the loan originator repeatedly decreasing loan originator compensation to defray the costs of pricing concessions for the same categories of settlement costs across multiple transactions. Like other records sufficient to evidence compensation paid to loan originators, the Bureau believes that records of decreases in loan originator compensation in unforeseen circumstances to defray the costs of increased settlement cost above those estimated should be retained for a time period commensurate with the statute of limitations for causes of action under TILA section 130 and be readily available for examination, which is necessary to prevent circumvention of and to facilitate compliance with TILA.</analysisParagraph>
          <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 25(c)(2)-1.ii would have clarified that the compensation agreement, evidence of which must be retained under 1026.25(c)(2), is any agreement, written or oral, or course of conduct that establishes a compensation arrangement between the parties. Proposed comment 25(c)(2)-1.iii provided an example where the expiration of the three-year retention period varies depending on when multiple payments of compensation are made. Proposed comment 25(c)(2)-2 provided an example of retention of records sufficient to evidence payment of compensation. The Bureau did not receive any public comment on these proposed comments. The Bureau is adopting comments 25(c)(2)-1.iii and 25(c)(2)-2 as proposed. Comment 25(c)(2)-1.ii is revised slightly from the proposal to clarify that where a compensation agreement is oral or based on a course of conduct and cannot itself be maintained, the records to be maintained are those, if any, evidencing the existence or terms of the oral or course of conduct compensation agreement.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1026.38 Content of Disclosures for Certain Mortgage Transactions (Closing Disclosure)</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1026.38 would have set forth the required content of the integrated Closing Disclosure, required by proposed § 1026.19(f) to be provided to a consumer no later than three business days prior to consummation.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Closing Disclosure would have integrated the disclosures currently provided in the RESPA settlement statement and the final TILA disclosure. In addition, the Closing Disclosure would have integrated several disclosures, including new disclosures under the Dodd-Frank Act, that otherwise would likely have been provided separately. The Bureau stated in the proposal that it believed that the five-page Closing Disclosure integrates at least nine pages of disclosures. Specifically, the proposed Closing Disclosure incorporated: (i) Three pages of the RESPA settlement statement; (ii) two pages typically used for the final TILA disclosure; (iii) one page for the negative amortization statement under TILA section 129C(f), which was added by section 1414(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act; (iv) one page for the anti-deficiency protection notice under TILA section 129C(g)(2), which was added by section 1414(c) of the Dodd-Frank Act; (v) one page for the partial payment policy disclosure under TILA section 129C(h), which was added by section 1414(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act; and (vi) one page for the escrow account disclosures under TILA sections 129D(h) and (j)(1)(A), which were added by sections 1461 and 1462 of the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, the Closing Disclosure would have incorporated the disclosure of: (i) The total interest percentage under TILA section 128(a)(19), which was added by section 1419 of the Dodd-Frank Act; (ii) the approximate amount of the wholesale rate of funds in connection with the loan under TILA section 128(a)(17), which was added by section 1419 of the Dodd-Frank Act; and (iii) the aggregate amount of settlement charges for all settlement services provided in connection with the loan and the aggregate amount of other fees or required payments in connection with the loan under TILA section 128(a)(17), which was added by section 1419 of the Dodd-Frank Act. In absence of the Bureau's integration of the final TILA disclosure and the RESPA settlement statement, these disclosures would have been added to the final TILA disclosure, which potentially could have increased that disclosure's typical two pages to three pages.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received numerous comments from industry and consumer groups related generally to the design of the proposed integrated disclosures, which are discussed with respect to the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.37. Specifically with respect to the design of the Closing Disclosure, the Bureau also received comments both criticizing and praising the proposed format. For example, a national title company commented that the proposed Closing Disclosure clearly addresses the most important questions consumers ask at the closing table and gives consumers an informative snapshot of their transaction. An independent title agent commented that the design of the proposed Closing Disclosure was easy to read. In contrast, a title insurance company commented that the Closing Disclosure is too long and overly complicated. Similarly, an individual title attorney commented that she saw no difference in the quality of information provided to consumers in the proposed Closing Disclosure as compared to the RESPA settlement statement and final TILA disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1026.38 would have provided that the information set forth in § 1026.38(a) through (s) shall be disclosed “as applicable.” The Bureau also proposed comment 38-1 to clarify that a disclosure that is not applicable to a transaction generally may be eliminated entirely or may be included but marked “not applicable” or “N/A.” The Bureau further proposed comment 38-2 to cross-reference § 1026.38(t) for permissible modifications to the format of the disclosures. The Bureau received numerous comments from industry and consumer advocacy groups related to the design of certain required disclosures, which are discussed in their respective section-by-section analyses. As discussed more fully in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.37, the Bureau received many comments that expressed confusion over whether inapplicable disclosures could be eliminated. In response to those comments, the Bureau is revising § 1026.38 to delete the phrase “as applicable.” The Bureau is further revising comment 38-1 to clarify that disclosures not applicable may be left blank, but that “N/A” or “not applicable” may not be used and form H-25 may not be modified. Accordingly, disclosures may not be deleted from form H-25 unless otherwise provided under § 1026.38. The Bureau is adopting comment 38-2 as proposed. The Bureau is also adding comment 38-3 to clarify that the creditor is required to disclose the actual terms and costs but can disclose estimates under certain circumstances when the actual term or cost is unknown.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>38(a) General Information</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As with the Loan Estimate in proposed § 1026.37(a), the Bureau proposed to use its authority under TILA section 105(a), and its authority under RESPA section 19(a), Dodd-Frank Act sections 1032(a) and (f), 1098, and 1100A, and for residential mortgage loans, Dodd-Frank Act section 1405(b), to combine and modify disclosures and related requirements currently provided under Regulations X and Z and add additional disclosures in the Closing Disclosure for transactions subject to proposed § 1026.19(f).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received a comment from a GSE requesting that the Bureau require additional information to be disclosed under § 1026.38(a). The GSE requested that the Closing Disclosure include a disclosure of the date on which the consumer's interest rate was locked, similar to the disclosure on the Loan Estimate required by § 1026.37(a)(13), which states the date the consumer's locked interest rate will expire. The GSE argued that such a statement on the Closing Disclosure would allow consumers to confirm that the rate they received at closing was locked on the date stated on the Loan Estimate and would provide lenders and investors with important data for compliance purposes. The Bureau does not believe that such a disclosure would benefit consumers given that a consumer could easily review the Loan Estimate to recall the date on which the interest rate was locked. Section 1026.19(f)(2)(v)(iv)(D) of this final rule requires a revised Loan Estimate to be provided to the consumer on the date the interest rate is locked. To prevent potential information overload for the consumer, the Bureau declines to add such a disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive any other comments on proposed § 1026.38(a) and is adopting it as proposed, pursuant to the legal authority discussed above and in the proposal. The specific disclosures required by § 1026.38 are discussed below.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>38(a)(1) Form Title</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Like the integrated disclosure provided three business days after application, TILA, RESPA, and the Dodd-Frank Act do not expressly prescribe a title for the form that must be provided in connection with a settlement. RESPA refers to the form as the “uniform settlement statement,” although § 1024.8 of Regulation X uses the titles HUD-1 and HUD-1A to refer to the forms used to document settlement charges in connection with the purchase of a property or refinancing of an existing mortgage loan, respectively. Regulation Z, however, does not prescribe a title for the disclosures that must be provided to the consumer three business days prior to consummation.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1026.38(a)(1) would have required the creditor to use the term “Closing Disclosure” as the name of the integrated disclosures provided to consumers three business days prior to consummation pursuant to proposed § 1026.19(f). The Bureau stated its belief in the proposal that the adoption of a standardized form name will effectuate the purposes of TILA and RESPA by promoting the informed use of credit and more effective advance notice of settlement costs, consistent with TILA section 105(a) and RESPA section 19(a), and will ensure that the features of the transaction are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to better understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with mortgage transactions in light of the facts and circumstances, consistent with Dodd-Frank Act section 1032(a). In addition, the Bureau stated in the proposal that it believed the use of standard terminology for the integrated disclosures will facilitate compliance for industry, which is a purpose of this rulemaking under Dodd-Frank Act sections 1098 and 1100A. The Bureau also stated its belief in the proposal that, consistent with section 1405(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act, the requirement of a standard form name may improve consumer awareness and understanding of transactions involving residential mortgage loans through the use of disclosures, and is in the interest of consumers and in the public interest.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive any public comments regarding proposed § 1026.38(a)(1). Because the Bureau continues to believe that a standard form title will serve to effectuate the purposes of TILA and RESPA, it is adopting § 1026.37(a)(1) as proposed.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>38(a)(2) Form Purpose</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1026.38(a)(2) would have required the creditor to include a statement regarding the purpose of the Closing Disclosure. Specifically, proposed § 1026.38(a)(2) would have required creditors to provide the following statement: “This form is a statement of final loan terms and closing costs. Compare this document with your Loan Estimate.” As noted in the proposal, providing the purpose of the Closing Disclosure is a new requirement, as neither creditors nor settlement agents are currently required to provide this type of information in the disclosures required by TILA, RESPA, and their implementing regulations. Nonetheless, the Bureau stated its belief in the proposal that this disclosure will benefit consumers and promote the informed use of credit by encouraging consumers to use both the Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure as tools to identify changes in costs and terms that may have occurred after issuance of the Loan Estimate. Accordingly, the Bureau believed, as stated in the proposal, that this disclosure will benefit consumers and effectuate the purposes of TILA and RESPA by promoting the informed use of credit and more effective advance notice of settlement costs, consistent with TILA section 105(a) and RESPA section 19(a), and will ensure that the features of the transaction are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to better understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with mortgage transactions, in light of the facts and circumstances, consistent with Dodd-Frank Act section 1032(a).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A national title insurance company commented that because the closing cost details disclosed on the Closing Disclosure may change between delivery of the Closing Disclosure and consummation of the transaction, the statement should be preceded by the phrase “subject to certain limited exceptions.” Several national trade associations representing mortgage lenders commented that the statement should direct consumers to compare it to their “most recent” Loan Estimate given that a consumer may receive more than one Loan Estimate. A national trade association representing developers of timeshares commented that the statement should not reference comparison to the Loan Estimate since the Loan Estimate should not be provided in timeshare transactions.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to the suggestion to include the phrase “subject to certain limited exceptions,” the Bureau believes adding that phrase would overly complicate the form purpose statement. The statement was designed to use plain language to describe the general difference between the Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure. With respect to timeshares, final comment 19(e)(1)(iii)-4 permits creditors in timeshare transactions to omit provision of the Loan Estimate and provide only the Closing Disclosure where the transaction is consummated within three business days of receipt of the consumer's application. The Bureau does not believe that the disclosure required by § 1026.37(a)(2) should be modified because the timeshare creditors can adequately explain to consumers at consummation why they were not required to receive the Loan Estimate in those transactions. The Bureau believes the statement will be just as useful to consumers of transactions secured by a consumer's interest in a timeshare plan where consummation occurs after the third business day from receipt of the consumer's application as it will be for consumers in transactions secured by real property. Accordingly, the Bureau declines to revise § 1026.37(a)(2) and is adopting it as proposed, pursuant to the legal authority described above and in the proposal.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>38(a)(3) Closing Information</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Appendix A to Regulation X currently requires the settlement agent to include in the RESPA settlement statement basic information about the settlement process, including the name of the settlement agent, the place of settlement, the property location, and the settlement date. In addition to this information, with the exception of the place of settlement, proposed § 1026.38(a)(3) would have required creditors to disclose: (1) the date the Closing Disclosure is issued; (2) the dates funds are disbursed to the seller and consumer, as applicable; (3) the sale price of the property that is the subject of the transaction; and (4) the file number assigned to the transaction by the closing agent. All of the aforementioned information would be located under the heading “Closing Information.” The Bureau stated its belief in the proposal that this information and the additional information discussed below effectuate the purposes of TILA and RESPA by promoting the informed use of credit and more effective advance notice of settlement costs, consistent with TILA section 105(a) and RESPA section 19(a), and will ensure that the features of the transaction are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to better understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with mortgage transactions, in light of the facts and circumstances, consistent with Dodd-Frank Act section 1032(a). The Bureau did not receive any comments on § 1026.38(a)(3) and is adopting it as proposed, pursuant to the legal authority described above and in the proposal. The specific requirements of the disclosure proposed in § 1026.38(a)(3) will be discussed below.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>38(a)(3)(i) Date Issued</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1026.38(a)(3)(i) would have required the creditor to disclose the date the disclosures required for transactions subject to § 1026.19(f) are issued to the consumer, labeled “Date Issued.” Proposed comment § 1026.38(a)(3)(i)-1 would have cross-referenced the commentary to proposed § 1026.37(a)(4).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A document preparation company commenter requested guidance on whether to disclose the date the form is printed or the date the form is mailed to the consumer. A national settlement company requested guidance on which date to disclose if the Closing Disclosure is printed at settlement or is printed after consummation for a purpose other than providing notice to the consumer. The same commenter also suggested that the Bureau add a space for disclosure of the time the disclosure is issued to the consumer, in the event that a creditor delivers more than one disclosure to a consumer in one day.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Regarding which date to disclose on the Closing Disclosure, as stated in proposed comment 37(a)(4)-1, the date issued is the date the form is delivered to the consumer, regardless of the method of delivery. In response to the request for guidance on how to disclose the date of a form printed after consummation, under § 1026.38(a)(3)(i), the Bureau believes that the regulation text is clear that the date to be disclosed is the date of delivery, regardless of whether it is printed after consummation for some other purpose. Lastly, with respect to the suggestion to permit disclosure of the time the Closing Disclosure is printed, while the Bureau understands that there may be instances in which a Closing Disclosure is revised and delivered to the consumer more than once in a single day, the Bureau believes that including the time may result in information overload and that consumers in most cases would only need to know the date the Closing Disclosure was issued. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting § 1026.38(a)(3)(i) and comment 38(a)(3)(i)-1 as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>38(a)(3)(ii) Closing Date</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1026.38(a)(3)(ii) would have required the creditor to disclose the consummation date for the mortgage loan transaction, labeled “Closing Date.” A national settlement company and a large bank both commented that the consummation date can only be an estimate at the time the Closing Disclosure is delivered, especially given the consumers right to waive the three-day waiting period between delivery of the Closing Disclosure and consummation under limited circumstances. The commenters requested that § 1026.38(a)(3)(ii) expressly permit disclosure of an estimated consummation date.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The commenters are correct that given the requirement that the Closing Disclosure be provided so that it is received by the consumer three days before consummation under § 1026.19(f)(1)(ii), the consummation date may, in some transactions, change after the delivery of the Closing Disclosure. However, § 1026.19(f)(1)(i) requires creditors to use the best information reasonably available to them to complete the Closing Disclosure and thus, the closing date disclosed under § 1026.38(a)(3)(ii) would be based on that best information. Moreover, under the requirements of § 1026.19(f)(2), if the disclosure previously provided becomes inaccurate, the creditor would be required to deliver a revised Closing Disclosure at consummation and the revised Closing Disclosure would therefore disclose the actual consummation date. Accordingly, either consummation of the transaction will occur on the date the creditor initially disclosed and be accurate, or the creditor will be required to revise the Closing Disclosure to reflect the date on which consummation actually occurs. In either case, the Closing Disclosure will reflect the actual date of consummation and not an estimate. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting § 1026.38(a)(3)(ii) as proposed. Section § 1026.38(a)(3)(ii) requires disclosure of the date of consummation of the transaction. Current § 1026.2(a)(13) defines “consummation” for purposes of Regulation Z as “the time that a consumer becomes contractually obligated on a credit transaction.” See commentary to § 1026.2(a)(13) for additional guidance regarding the definition of consummation.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>38(a)(3)(iii) Disbursement Date</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1026.38(a)(3)(iii) would have required the disclosure of the date the amounts disclosed pursuant to proposed § 1026.38(j)(3)(iii) and (k)(3)(iii) are expected to be paid to the consumer and seller, respectively, labeled “Disbursement Date.” A large bank commenter noted that because the consumer has the right, under limited circumstances, to waive the three-day waiting period between delivery of the Closing Disclosure and the closing, the disbursement date is necessarily an estimate and should be labeled “Estimated Disbursement Date.” The Bureau notes that under § 1026.19(f)(1)(i), creditors are required to disclose the actual terms of the legal obligation, but where such information is not known to the creditor, creditors must disclose the best information reasonably available. Accordingly, under § 1026.38(a)(3)(iii), creditors may disclose the date the funds are expected to be paid to the consumer and seller using the best information reasonably available regarding such date. See the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.19(f)(1)(i) and its commentary for further discussion regarding the labeling of estimates on the Closing Disclosure. Accordingly, the Bureau declines to add the word “estimated” to the label “Disbursement Date.” The Bureau is adopting § 1026.38(a)(3)(iii) substantially as proposed, but is modifying the provision to provide additional clarity regarding the required disclosure in transactions that are not purchase transactions under § 1026.37(a)(9). In such non-purchase transactions, creditors are required to disclose the date the amounts disclosed pursuant to § 1026.38(j)(2)(iii) or (t)(5)(vii)(B) are expected to be paid to the consumer or a third party.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>38(a)(3)(iv) Settlement Agent</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1026.38(a)(3)(iv) would have required disclosure of the identity of the settlement agent conducting the closing, labeled “Agent.” Proposed comment 38(a)(3)(iv)-1 would have clarified that the name of the agency that employs the settlement agent should be provided in the disclosure required by § 1026.38(a)(3)(iv) and that the name of the individual conducting the closing is not required. Several industry commenters noted in response to the proposal that the label “Agent” was unclear given the numerous types of agents involved in a real estate transaction. In addition, GSE commenters noted that the proposal used the term “Settlement Agent” in the contact information table required under proposed § 1026.38(r), in contrast with the label proposed under § 1026.38(a)(3)(iv). The Bureau agrees that the label “Agent” was not sufficiently specific and did not conform with the contact information table in the proposed Closing Disclosure. Accordingly, the Bureau is revising the label for the disclosure required by § 1026.38(a)(3)(iv) to “Settlement Agent,” to improve the consistency and clarity of the Closing Disclosure. The Bureau is also revising final comment 38(a)(3)(iv)-1 to reflect the label “Settlement Agent” and to refer to the entity employing the settlement agent, rather than the agency, such that the term will cover settlement agents that are employed by entities that are not title insurance agents, such as law firms.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>38(a)(3)(v) File Number</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1026.38(a)(3)(v) would have required disclosure of the number assigned to the transaction by the closing agent for identification purposes, labeled “File #.” A national settlement company requested that the Bureau add “Settlement” before the proposed label “File #” to clarify whose file number is disclosed on the Closing Disclosure. Because the file number disclosure is directly below the Settlement Agent disclosure on the Closing Disclosure, the Bureau believes that consumers will understand that the file number being disclosed is that of the Settlement Agent. Moreover, § 1026.38(a)(5)(v) requires that the creditor separately disclose its own loan identification number, under the label “Loan ID #” which further clarifies that the file number referred to on form H-25 is the settlement agent's. Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting § 1026.38(a)(3)(v) as proposed. The Bureau is also adding comment 38(a)(3)(v)-1 to clarify that the file number may contain any alpha-numeric characters and need not be limited to numbers.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>38(a)(3)(vi) Property</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1026.38(a)(3)(vi) would have required the street address of the property required to be disclosed under proposed § 1026.37(a)(6), labeled “Property.” Proposed comment 38(a)(3)(iv)-1 would have cross-referenced the commentary to § 1026.37(a)(6), which provides guidance regarding the information that must be provided in response to this requirement when a standard property address is unavailable. A GSE commenter requested guidance on how to disclose personal property that secures a transaction under proposed § 1026.38(a)(3)(vi). That comment is addressed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.37(a)(6), in response to which the Bureau added comment 37(a)(6)-2 to provide that where personal property secures a transaction, a description of the personal property may be disclosed to the extent that it fits on the space provided for the disclosure on form H-24 for the Loan Estimate. The Bureau is adopting § 1026.38(a)(3)(vi) and comment 38(a)(3)(vi)-1 substantially as proposed but with modifications to clarify that, unlike with respect to the disclosure of personal property in connection with the Loan Estimate, personal property securing the transaction may be disclosed if it does not fit within the space provided on form H-25 by using an addendum to form H-25 for the Closing Disclosure. The Bureau believes that in connection with the consummation of the transaction, the consumer should be provided with this information to understand the final loan terms and costs of the transaction.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>38(a)(3)(vii) Sale Price</title>
        <analysisParagraph>In credit transactions where there is a seller, proposed § 1026.38(a)(3)(vii)(A) would have required disclosure of the contract sale price for the property identified in proposed § 1026.38(a)(3)(vii), labeled “Sale Price.” In transactions where there is no seller, proposed § 1026.38(a)(3)(vii)(B) would have required disclosure of the appraised value of the property in proposed § 1026.38(a)(3)(vi), labeled “Appraised Prop. Value.” Proposed comment 38(a)(3)(vii)-1 also would have provided that when there is no seller that is a party to the transaction, the value to be disclosed is that determined by the appraisal or valuation used to determine approval of the credit transaction, or if a more recent appraisal or valuation has been obtain by the creditor, the value determined by the more recent appraisal or valuation.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive any comments on proposed § 1026.38(a)(3)(vii)(A) and is adopting it as proposed. Several national trade associations representing mortgage lenders commented that in transactions without a seller, such as a refinance transaction, an appraisal is not always obtained and that § 1026.38(a)(3)(vii)(B) should permit disclosure of an estimated property value. A GSE commented that the value that should be disclosed is the one used for underwriting, regardless of whether there is a subsequent appraisal. The GSE commenter noted that other fees disclosed on the Closing Disclosure, such as mortgage insurance and loan level pricing adjustments, are tied to the loan-to-value ratio which is, in turn, determined by the value used for underwriting. The commenter stated that disclosing a value different than the one used for underwriting would render the disclosures on the Closing Disclosure misaligned and cause confusion for consumers and creditors. A GSE also requested guidance on whether to disclose the value of personal property in transactions where such property is valued separately from real property.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to refinance transactions where an appraisal may not be obtained, the Bureau agrees that disclosing an estimated property value is permissible where an appraisal is not obtained and is revising comment 38(a)(3)(vii)-1 to permit disclosure of an estimated property value if the creditor has not obtained an appraisal. Revised comment 38(a)(3)(vii)-1 further provides that where an estimate, rather than an appraisal, is used, the label for the disclosure would be changed to “Estimated Prop. Value.”</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Regarding the GSE's comment that the value disclosed should be the one used for underwriting, the Bureau agrees that the value disclosed on the Closing Disclosure should be the one used for underwriting for the reasons suggested by the commenter. Accordingly, the Bureau is further revising comment 38(a)(3)(vii)-1 to revise the description of the requirement to disclose the most recent appraisal or valuation and clarify that § 1026.38(a)(3)(vii) requires disclosure of the appraisal or estimate used to determine approval of the credit transaction. Regarding the GSE's request for guidance on the disclosure of personal property, the Bureau addresses that comment in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.37(a)(7), above. The Bureau added comment 37(a)(7)-2 to clarify that where personal property is included in the sale price of real property § 1026.37(a)(7) permits disclosure of the aggregate price without any reduction for the appraised or estimated value of the real property. The Bureau is adding comment 38(a)(3)(vii)-2 to cross-reference the guidance provided in comment 37(a)(7)-2 regarding the disclosure of personal property.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>38(a)(4) Transaction Information</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1026.38(a)(4) would have required the creditor to disclose the names and addresses of the parties to the transaction: the borrower, seller, and lender, as applicable. This information would appear under the heading “Transaction Information.” As noted in the proposal, these disclosures are currently provided in the RESPA settlement statement. See appendix A to Regulation X. In addition, TILA section 128(a)(1) and Regulation Z § 1026.18(a) require disclosure of the identity of the creditor. The Bureau stated its belief in the proposal that these disclosures effectuate the purposes of TILA and RESPA by promoting the informed use of credit and more effective advance notice of settlement costs, consistent with TILA section 105(a) and RESPA section 19(a), and will ensure that the features of the transaction are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to better understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with mortgage transactions, in light of the facts and circumstances, consistent with Dodd-Frank Act section 1032(a). Proposed comment 38(a)(4)-1 would have clarified that the name and address for each consumer and seller must be provided and referred creditors to the commentary to proposed § 1026.37(a)(5) for further guidance. Proposed comment 38(a)(4)-1 also would have clarified that the name and address of each consumer must be provided and that if the form does not provide enough space to include the required information for each seller, an additional page with that information may be appended to the end of the form, provided the creditor is in compliance with proposed § 1026.38(t)(3). Proposed comment 38(a)(4)-1 also would have cross-referenced commentary to § 1026.37(a)(5) for guidance on how to disclose multiple borrowers. Proposed comment 38(a)(4)-2 would have clarified that, in transactions where there is no seller such as in a refinancing or home equity loan, the creditor must provide the name of the person or persons primarily liable under the obligation or who have a right of rescission. Finally, proposed comment 38(a)(4)-3 would have cross-referenced the commentary to proposed § 1026.37(a)(3) for information regarding the identification of multiple creditors.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A GSE commented that the heading “Transaction Information” is misleading because the information disclosed relates only to the parties to the transaction. Two document preparation company commenters requested guidance on who meets the definition of “creditor” and is therefore required to be disclosed under proposed § 1026.38(a)(4).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to the heading “Transaction Information,” as discussed elsewhere in this section-by-section analysis, the Bureau extensively tested the integrated disclosures with consumers and found no evidence that consumers were confused by this heading. Accordingly, the Bureau declines to revise the heading “Transaction Information” required under § 1026.38(a)(4). Regarding the request for guidance on which creditor is required to be disclosed, the definition of “creditor” is addressed by § 1026.2(a)(17) and its accompanying commentary. The Bureau notes that comment 38(a)(4)-3 cross-references § 1026.37(a)(3) and its commentary for guidance. The Bureau also notes the existing guidance regarding transactions with multiple creditors under comment 17(d)-1 which is cross-referenced in commentary to § 1026.37(a)(3), and therefore believes adequate guidance is provided in the regulation as proposed. Because the Bureau continues to believe that disclosing the described transaction information will effectuate the purposes of TILA and RESPA, it is adopting § 1026.38(a)(4) as proposed. The Bureau did not receive any comments on comments 38(a)(4)-1 through -3 and is adopting them substantially as proposed but with minor modifications for clarity.</analysisParagraph>

        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1026.38(a)(5) would have required the creditor to provide certain information about the mortgage loan that is the subject of the transaction. With the exception of the mortgage insurance case number required by proposed § 1026.38(a)(5)(vi), all of the disclosures required under proposed § 1026.38(a)(5) mirror the disclosures required by proposed § 1026.37(a)(8) through (12). In the proposal, the Bureau stated its belief that these disclosures effectuate the purposes of TILA and RESPA by promoting the informed use of credit and more effective advance notice of settlement costs, consistent with TILA section 105(a) and RESPA section 19(a), and will ensure that the features of the transaction are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to better understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with mortgage transactions, in light of the facts and circumstances, consistent with Dodd-Frank Act section 1032(a).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 38(a)(5)-1 would have referred the creditor to the commentary to proposed § 1026.37(a)(8) through (12) for further guidance on the general requirements and definitions applicable to proposed § 1026.38(a)(5)(i) through (v). The disclosures required by proposed § 1026.38(a)(5) appear under the heading “Loan Information.” Comments received in relation to the disclosures required by § 1026.37(a)(8) through (12) that are mirrored in § 1026.38(a)(5) are addressed in the section-by-section analyses of § 1026.37(a)(8) through (12).

        <title>38(a)(5)(v) Loan Identification Number</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1026.38(a)(5)(v) would have required disclosure of the loan identification number, consistent with § 1026.37(a)(12) and labeled “Loan ID #.” Comments received in relation to the loan identification number disclosure generally are discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.37(a)(12). One document preparation company commenter requested that the disclosure of the loan identification number on the Closing Disclosure be permitted to differ from that on the Loan Estimate because the identifying number used may be one used by the settlement company, rather than the lender.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Notwithstanding the fact that a settlement company may use an identification number for a transaction that differs from that used by the creditor, the Bureau believes that disclosing the same identification number on the Loan Estimate and the Closing Disclosure is beneficial for consumers who wish to compare the Closing Disclosure to the Loan Estimate. The settlement company would not be required, however, to use the identification number disclosed on the Loan Estimate and the Closing Disclosure in its own systems and can list its identification number under § 1026.38(a)(3)(v).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau continues to believe that disclosure of a loan identification number will promote the informed use of credit, and accordingly, is adopting § 1026.38(a)(5)(v) as proposed. The Bureau is also adding comment 38(a)(5)(v)-1 to clarify that the identification number disclosed on the Closing Disclosure must be one that enables the creditor, consumer, and other parties to identify the transaction as the same transaction that was disclosed on the Loan Estimate under § 1026.37. The Bureau has also clarified in the comment that the loan identification number may contain any alpha-numeric character, which means that the identification number need not be limited to numbers.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>38(a)(5)(vi) Mortgage Insurance Case Number</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The mortgage insurance case number currently is disclosed in section B of the RESPA settlement statement. See appendix A to Regulation X. Proposed § 1026.38(a)(5)(vi) would have incorporated this disclosure into the Closing Disclosure, labeled “MIC #.” A national settlement company commented that the label “MIC #” would be confusing to consumers. The Bureau extensively tested the integrated disclosures with consumers and did not find that the proposed label “MIC #” detracted from consumer understanding of the loan transactions. The Bureau believes that to the extent consumers do not understand the acronym, they can find such information from other sources, such as the Bureau's Web site, the creditor's or mortgage broker's loan officer, the settlement agent, or real estate agents. The Closing Disclosure will contain a statement referring consumers to the Bureau's Web site to obtain more information next to a graphic depiction of a question mark, which consumer testing conducted by the Bureau indicated drew consumers' attention to the notice. See Kleimann Testing Report at 224. Accordingly, the Bureau believes that consumers will have available information regarding this information in the disclosure should they have questions. For the aforementioned reasons, the Bureau is adopting § 1026.38(a)(5)(vi) as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>38(b) Loan Terms</title>
        <analysisParagraph>For transactions subject to § 1026.19(f), proposed § 1026.38(b) would have implemented the requirements of TILA section 128(a)(6), (a)(11), and (b)(2)(C)(ii) by requiring creditors to disclose on the Closing Disclosure the table of key loan terms provided on the Loan Estimate pursuant to proposed § 1026.37(b). This information includes the loan amount; interest rate; periodic principal and interest payment; whether the loan amount, interest rate, or periodic payment may increase; and whether the loan has a prepayment penalty or balloon payment. For a detailed description of the Bureau's implementation of these statutory provisions and its legal authority for this final rule, see the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.37(b). The requirements of proposed § 1026.38(b) generally would have mirrored those of § 1026.37(b). Proposed comment 38(b)-1 would have provided a cross-reference to the commentary to § 1026.37(b) for guidance on the disclosures required by § 1026.38(b). The Bureau did not receive any comments on proposed § 1026.38(b) or its associated commentary not already discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.37(b) and is adopting § 1026.38(b) and its accompanying commentary as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1026.38(c) would have implemented the requirements of TILA section 128(a)(6), (a)(16), (b)(2)(C), and (b)(4) for transactions subject to proposed § 1026.19(f), by requiring creditors to disclose on the Closing Disclosure the periodic payment or range of payments, together with an estimate of the taxes, insurance, and assessments and the payments to be made with escrow account funds. 15 U.S.C. 128(a)(6), (a)(16), (b)(2)(C), (b)(4). The requirements of proposed § 1026.38(c) generally would have mirrored those of proposed § 1026.37(c), with certain exceptions which are discussed below. Accordingly, proposed comment 38(c)-1 would have directed creditors to § 1026.37(c) and its commentary for guidance on the disclosures required by § 1026.38(c). For a detailed description of the Bureau's implementation of these statutory provisions and the Bureau's legal authority, see the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.37(c) above. As discussed below in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.38(t), the items that would have been required to be disclosed pursuant to § 1026.38 would have been actual terms and costs, as required by proposed § 1026.19(f).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1026.38(c) would have differed from proposed § 1026.37(c) in several ways. First, proposed § 1026.38(c)(2) would have required an additional reference to the information required by proposed § 1026.38(l)(7). The proposal noted the Bureau's belief, based on consumer testing, that this additional reference would help consumers to understand the specific payment amounts to be made with escrow funds and those that must be paid separately by the consumer. Second, proposed § 1026.38(c) would have provided different rules for estimating escrow payments. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of proposed § 1026.37(c), the Dodd-Frank Act amended TILA to add new requirements regarding the disclosure of escrow payments in consumer credit transactions secured by a first mortgage on the principal dwelling of the consumer, other than an open-end credit plan or reverse mortgage. Specifically, TILA section 128(b)(4)(A) provides that the disclosures required by TILA section 128(a)(6) must take into account the amount of any monthly payment to an escrow account, in accordance with section 10(a)(2) of RESPA. 15 U.S.C. 1638(b)(4)(A); 12 U.S.C. 2609(a)(2). In addition, new TILA section 128(b)(4)(B) generally requires creditors to take into account the taxable assessed value of the property during the first year after consummation, including the value of any improvements constructed or to be constructed on the property, if known, and the replacement costs of the property for hazard or flood insurance, when disclosing estimated escrow payments pursuant to TILA section 128(b)(4)(A). 15 U.S.C. 1638(b)(4)(B). For the Loan Estimate provided to consumers near the time of application, proposed § 1026.37(c) generally would have incorporated these statutory provisions, but would have expanded the requirements to all transactions subject to § 1026.37(c). However, the proposal noted the Bureau's belief that separate treatment is required for the Closing Disclosure because the statutory requirements may conflict with certain provisions of Regulation X, which implements the provisions of RESPA sections 6(g) and 10, regarding the administration of escrow accounts. 12 U.S.C. 2605(g), 2609.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Current Regulation X § 1024.17(c)(7) specifies how a creditor conducting an escrow account analysis must estimate disbursement amounts. If the creditor knows the charge for a particular escrow item, the creditor must use that amount in estimating the disbursement. If the charge is unknown, the creditor may base the estimate on the preceding year's charge, but may adjust the estimate to account for inflation. The Regulation X requirement that the creditor use actual charges, if known, in estimating escrow payment amounts may conflict with the TILA section 128(b)(4)(B) requirement that the creditor take into account the replacement costs of the property for hazard insurance when determining the estimated escrow amount. Under the plain language of TILA section 128(b)(4)(B), a creditor must base estimated escrows for hazard insurance on the replacement costs of the property, even if it knows that the actual charges will be different. The proposal noted that while the Bureau believes that the TILA requirement for estimating escrow payments is appropriate for the Loan Estimate because it requires creditors to use a uniform standard for estimates and therefore facilitates comparison, the disclosure of actual payment amounts, when known, is more appropriate for the Closing Disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, the Bureau proposed to use its authority under TILA section 105(a), Dodd-Frank Act section 1032(a), and, for residential mortgage loans, Dodd-Frank Act section 1405(b) to modify the requirements of TILA section 128(b)(4)(B) for the estimation of escrow payment amounts on the Closing Disclosure. Proposed § 1026.38(c) would have provided that, in disclosing estimated escrow payments as described in § 1026.37(c)(2)(iii) and (4)(ii), the amount disclosed on the Closing Disclosure: (1) for transactions subject to RESPA, is determined under the escrow account analysis described in Regulation X, 12 CFR 1024.17, and (2) for transactions not subject to RESPA, may be determined under the escrow account analysis described in Regulation X, 12 CFR 1024.17, or in the manner set forth in § 1026.37(c)(5). Comment 38(c)(1)-1 would have clarified that the amount of estimated escrow payments disclosed on the Closing Disclosure is accurate if it differs from the estimated escrow payment disclosed on the Loan Estimate due to the escrow account analysis described in Regulation X, 12 CFR 1024.17. The Bureau noted its belief that the proposed modification would effectuate the purposes of TILA by promoting the informed use of credit by allowing disclosure of actual escrow amounts for hazard insurance, when known. Additionally, the Bureau noted its belief that the proposed modification would ease compliance burden for creditors. In particular, permitting creditors in transactions not subject to RESPA to rely on the accounting rules described in Regulation X, 12 CFR 1024.17, to calculate the escrow payment disclosure would avoid requiring creditors to follow a separate disclosure requirement for the relatively small number of transactions that are subject to TILA but not RESPA. The Bureau also noted that the proposed modification will also improve consumer awareness and understanding of residential mortgage loans and is in the interest of consumers and the public, consistent with Dodd-Frank Act section 1405(b). The Bureau also noted its belief that the disclosure would ensure that the features of consumer credit transactions secured by real property are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the product or service, in light of the facts and circumstances, consistent with Dodd-Frank Act section 1032(a).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received a number of comments on the projected payments table from industry and consumer advocacy groups. Those comments are generally discussed above in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.37(c). The Bureau has considered those comments and made certain adjustments to the rules regarding the projected payments table in response to those comments and for additional clarity, as discussed above. Because the requirements of proposed § 1026.38(c) generally would have mirrored those of proposed § 1026.37(c), with certain exceptions outlined above, the comments received regarding the projected payments table are generally applicable to the projected payments table under § 1026.38(c). In addition, one industry trade association commenter argued that, unlike the Loan Estimate where estimated escrow payments should always be disclosed, loans with no escrow account do not need escrow information on a Closing Disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons discussed in the proposed rule, in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.37(c), and below, the Bureau is adopting § 1026.38(c) as proposed, although the changes to the projected payments table described above in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.37(c) also apply § 1026.38(c). The Bureau has considered the comment suggesting that loans with no escrow account do not need escrow information disclosed on the Closing Disclosure. However, as noted above in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.37(c) and in the Kleimann Testing Report, consumer testing indicates that consumers view their total monthly payment as a key piece of information and that, even where no escrow account is established for the payment of taxes and insurance, the Bureau believes that information about such costs is an important measure of the consumer's ability to afford the transaction. See Kleimann Testing Report at 285. Absent such a disclosure, consumers may not fully comprehend the cost of their home loan on a periodic basis, and may not be as readily able to make an informed decision about whether to proceed with the transaction. Accordingly, the final rule requires creditors to disclose consumer's taxes, insurance, and assessment information on the table required by § 1026.38(c), even where no escrow account for the payment of such amounts will be established.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>38(d) Costs at Closing</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau's proposed § 1026.38(d) would have required the disclosure of the cash required from the consumer at consummation of the transaction, with a breakdown of the amounts of loan costs and other costs associated with the transaction under a heading of “Cash to Close.” Under proposed § 1026.38(d)(1), the dollar amount due from the consumer would have been the same amount as calculated in accordance with proposed § 1026.38(j)(3)(iii) and would have been disclosed under a heading of “Cash to Close” and labeled “Cash to Close.” The total dollar amount of the loan costs to be paid by the consumer at closing as calculated under proposed § 1026.38(f)(4) would have been disclosed under proposed § 1026.38(d)(2) with a description of “Loan Costs.” The total dollar amount of the other costs to be paid by the consumer at closing as calculated under proposed § 1026.38(g)(5) would have been disclosed under proposed § 1026.38(d)(3) with a description of “Other Costs.” The amount of lender credits disclosed under § 1026.38(h)(3) would have been disclosed under § 1026.38(d)(4) with a description of “Lender Credits.” The sum of the amounts disclosed under § 1026.38(d)(2), 1026.38(d)(3), and 1026.38(d)(4) would have been disclosed with a description of “Closing Costs” under § 1026.38(d)(5). A statement directing the consumer to refer to the tables required under § 1026.38(f) and (g) for more details would have been required under § 1026.38(d)(6).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As more fully discussed in the section-by-section analysis of proposed § 1026.37(d) and (h), above, and § 1026.38(e), below, several commenters stated that the cash to close amount would be difficult for consumers to understand, especially in the case of a cash-out refinance transaction where the cash to close amount disclosed under proposed § 1026.38(d)(1) would have been negative. These commenters stated that consumers would have difficulty in understanding negative numbers in this context. The Bureau, in response to these comments, conducted additional qualitative testing of the proposed integrated disclosures using a sample refinance transaction in which a consumer would receive cash at consummation, in which case the cash to close would be disclosed as a negative amount, and a modified version of the integrated disclosures with an alternative table that would use checkboxes to denote that cash was received at consummation. As described in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.37(d) above, based on the comments received and this qualitative testing, the Bureau believes that disclosing a positive cash to close amount with a checkbox to denote that cash will be received will be more understandable to consumers than disclosing a negative amount for the cash to close. In addition, as also described in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.37(d) above, in response to comments received regarding the proposed cash to close tables under §§ 1026.37(d) and 1026.38(d) and the results of one question in the Bureau's Quantitative Study regarding the total closing costs amount, the Bureau tested with consumers a revised cash to close table on page 1 of the Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure to place equal emphasis on the total closing costs amount and the cash to close amount for consumers, rather than placing the total closing costs amount embedded in text to the right of the cash to close amount as it was in the proposed Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure. See Kleimann Post-Proposal Testing Report at 51-52, 58, 62, 71; Kleimann Quantitative Study at 74. This table included a revised heading, “Costs at Closing.” Based on the comments received and its consumer testing, the Bureau believes this modification to the cash to close table enhances consumer understanding of the transaction.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, the Bureau is adopting § 1026.38(d) as revised from proposed § 1026.38(d) to revise the heading to “Costs at Closing,” and to include two separate rows: the first row contains the total closing costs, loan costs, other costs, and lender credits in connection with the transaction, as well as a reference to the closing cost details under § 1026.38(f), (g), and (h) (disclosed on page 2 of the Closing Disclosure); and the second row contains the cash to close amount, a statement that the cash to close amount includes closing costs, and a reference to the calculating cash to close table under § 1026.38(i) (disclosed on page 3 of the Closing Disclosure), as illustrated by form H-25 of appendix H to Regulation Z. In addition, § 1026.38(d) as revised provides for an alternative cash to close disclosure for transactions without a seller, consistent with the provisions of § 1026.37(d) and (h) and § 1026.38(e). As a result of these revisions, the cash to close disclosure under proposed § 1026.38(d), is adopted in § 1026.38(d)(1), which will use cross-references from the provisions of § 1026.38(f), (g), and (h) for the amounts to be disclosed. The alternative cash to close disclosure under § 1026.38(d)(2) must be provided for transactions without a seller when the Loan Estimate is disclosed with the optional alternative table pursuant to § 1026.37(d)(2). The alternative cash to close disclosure under § 1026.38(d)(2) will use cross-references from the provisions of § 1026.38(e) for the amounts to be disclosed. The Bureau also is adopting comments 38(d)(2)-1, which clarifies that the use of the alternative cash to close disclosure under § 1026.38(d)(2) must be used when the alternative calculating cash to close table under § 1026.38(e) is used; and 38(d)(2)-2, which provides an example of how the indication of whether the cash is due from or to the consumer can be disclosed with the use of checkboxes, as shown in form H-25(J) of appendix H.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to its authority under TILA section 105(a), RESPA section 19(a), and Dodd-Frank section 1032(a), the Bureau requires creditors to provide the actual total closing costs imposed upon the consumer and the amount of the cash required at consummation from the consumer. This disclosure will promote the informed use of credit and consumer understanding of the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the loan because it will indicate to the consumer the amount the consumer will pay at consummation of the credit transaction and closing of the real estate transaction.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>38(e) Alternative Calculating Cash To Close Table for Transactions Without a Seller</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analyses of §§ 1026.37(d) and (h) and 1026.38(d) and (i), the Bureau is adopting an alternative Calculating Cash to Close table for use in a transaction without a seller in response to the comments received that expressed concerns regarding the proposed calculation's understandability for consumers in refinance transactions, and the disclosure of a negative cash to close amount for transactions in which a consumer would receive cash from a refinance transaction. The Bureau developed and conducted qualitative consumer testing of an alternative Calculating Cash to Close table after reviewing these comments. The Bureau's consumer testing of the alternative table demonstrated greater consumer comprehension and the alternative table proved to be readily understood by consumers for transactions without a seller. See Kleimann Post-Proposal Testing Report at 58, 71.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, the Bureau adopts § 1026.38(e) to require an alternative calculating cash to close table for transactions without a seller when the Loan Estimate was disclosed with the optional alternative Calculating Cash to Close table permitted under § 1026.37(h)(2). The Bureau is requiring use of the alternative Calculating Cash to Close table permitted under § 1026.38(e) if the optional alternative table under § 1026.37(h)(2) is used because the Bureau designed the tables to match information and content. The Bureau has designed the Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure generally to match, to enable easier comparison of estimated and final numbers for consumers. The Bureau's Quantitative Study determined that consumer participants using the Bureau's integrated disclosures performed statistically significantly better than consumer participants using the current disclosures at comparing estimated and final loan terms costs. See Kleimann Quantitative Study Report at 68. The Bureau believes this increased performance is due, in part, to the matching designs of the Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure. Accordingly, the Bureau has determined to require the alternative Calculating Cash to Close table permitted under § 1026.38(e) if the optional alternative table under § 1026.37(h)(2) is used, because use of a similar format and content for the table on both the Loan Estimate and the Closing Disclosure will enable consumers to compare changes more easily between the estimated and final terms and costs, aiding consumer understanding of the transaction, which is one of the purposes of the integrated disclosures under Dodd-Frank Act sections 1098 and 1100A.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The alternative table under § 1026.38(e) discloses the loan amount, total closing costs, amount of closing costs paid before closing, payoffs and payments, the total amount of cash to or from the consumer, and the closing costs financed. These items, with the exception of closing costs financed, would be disclosed with three columns: the first to disclose the corresponding amounts from the Loan Estimate under § 1026.37(h)(2); the second to disclose amounts from § 1026.38(f), (g), and (t)(5)(viii)(B); and the final column to disclose whether the amounts change, with additional statements providing more information to the consumer about the change. The disclosure of the closing costs financed, because it is not part of the calculation of the cash to close in the alternative table, is not disclosed as a row in the table, but instead, disclosed in the bottom right of the table. The calculation of the closing costs financed amount in the alternative table under § 1026.38(e) is the same as under § 1026.38(h)(2)(v), except that the sum of closing costs designated borrower-paid before closing under § 1026.38(h)(2) are subtracted from the amount, because those costs are not paid from loan funds. The consumer has made payment for those charges before the loan was consummated. The Bureau is adopting comment 38(e)-1 to clarify that the optional use of the alternative table must be made in conjunction with the alternative disclosure under § 1026.38(d)(2). Based on its authority under TILA section 105(a), RESPA section 19(a), and Dodd-Frank Act section 1032(a), the Bureau is requiring the creditor in a transaction without a seller to provide an alternative Calculating Cash to Close table in lieu of disclosing the table required by § 1026.38(i) when the alternative Calculating Cash to Close table was disclosed pursuant to § 1026.37(h)(2) which highlights the cash to close amount and its critical components and compares those amounts to the corresponding disclosures shown on the Loan Estimate under § 1026.37(h). The Bureau believes that this disclosure will effectuate the purposes of TILA and RESPA by facilitating the informed use of credit and ensuring that consumers are provided with greater and timelier information on the costs of the closing process. Providing consumers with information about the cash to close amount, its critical components, and how such amounts changed from the estimated amounts disclosed on the Loan Estimate helps ensure that the features of the transaction are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to better understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the transaction, in light of the facts and circumstances, consistent with Dodd-Frank Act section 1032(a).</analysisParagraph>
