  <change operation="modified" label="1026-1-b" subpath="content">
    <content>The purpose of this part is to promote the informed use of <ref target="1026-2-a-12" reftype="term">consumer credit</ref> by requiring disclosures about its terms and cost, to ensure that <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumers</ref> are provided with greater and more timely information on the nature and costs of the residential real estate settlement process, and to effect certain changes in the settlement process for residential real estate that will result in more effective advance disclosure to home buyers and sellers of settlement costs. The regulation also includes substantive protections. It gives <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumers</ref> the right to cancel certain credit transactions that involve a lien on a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s principal <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>, regulates certain <ref target="1026-2-a-15-i" reftype="term">credit card</ref> practices, and provides a means for fair and timely resolution of <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> billing disputes. The regulation does not generally govern charges for <ref target="1026-2-a-12" reftype="term">consumer credit</ref>, except that several provisions in subpart G set forth special rules addressing certain charges applicable to <ref target="1026-2-a-15-i" reftype="term">credit card</ref> accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) <ref target="1026-2-a-12" reftype="term">consumer credit</ref> plan. The regulation requires a maximum interest rate to be stated in variable-rate contracts secured by the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>. It also imposes limitations on home-equity plans that are subject to the requirements of § <ref target="1026-40" reftype="internal">1026.40</ref> and mortgages that are subject to the requirements of § <ref target="1026-32" reftype="internal">1026.32</ref>. The regulation prohibits certain acts or practices in connection with <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> secured by a <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> in § <ref target="1026-36" reftype="internal">1026.36</ref>, and <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> secured by a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s principal <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> in § <ref target="1026-35" reftype="internal">1026.35</ref>. The regulation also regulates certain practices of <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> who extend <ref target="1026-46-b-5" reftype="term">private education loans</ref> as defined in § <ref target="1026-46-b-5" reftype="internal">1026.46(b)(5)</ref>. In addition, it imposes certain limitations on increases in costs for mortgage transactions subject to § <ref target="1026-19-e" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)</ref> and <ref target="1026-19-f" reftype="internal">(f)</ref>.</content>

For example, under these plans, a series of graduated payments may be scheduled before rate adjustments affect payment amounts, or the initial scheduled payment may remain constant for a set period before rate adjustments affect the payment amount. In any case, the initial payment amount may be insufficient to cover the scheduled interest, causing negative amortization from the outset of the transaction.

Information is unknown if it is not reasonably available to the creditor at the time the disclosures are made. The “reasonably available” standard requires that the creditor, acting in good faith, exercise due diligence in obtaining information. For example, the creditor must at a minimum utilize generally accepted calculation tools, but need not invest in the most sophisticated computer program to make a particular type of calculation. The creditor normally may rely on the representations of other parties in obtaining information. For example, the creditor might look to the consumer for the time of consummation, to insurance companies for the cost of insurance, or to realtors for taxes and escrow fees. The creditor may utilize estimates in making disclosures even though the creditor knows that more precise information will be available by the point of consummation. However, new disclosures may be required under § <ref target="1026-17-f" reftype="internal">1026.17(f)</ref> or § <ref target="1026-19" reftype="internal">1026.19</ref>.

For all other disclosures, even though they are based on the same assumption on which a specific estimated disclosure was based, the creditor has flexibility in labeling the estimates. Generally, only the particular disclosure for which the exact information is unknown is labeled as an estimate. However, when several disclosures are affected because of the unknown information, the creditor has the option of labeling either every affected disclosure or only the disclosure primarily affected. For example, when the finance charge is unknown because the date of consummation is unknown, the creditor must label the finance charge as an estimate and may also label as estimates the total of payments and the payment schedule. When many disclosures are estimates, the creditor may use a general statement, such as “all numerical disclosures except the late payment disclosure are estimates,” as a method to label those disclosures as estimates.</content>

If the amount of per-diem interest used in preparing the disclosures for consummation is based on the information known to the creditor at the time the disclosure document is prepared, the disclosures are considered accurate under this rule, and affected disclosures are also considered accurate, even if the disclosures are not labeled as estimates. For example, if the amount of per-diem interest used to prepare disclosures is less than the amount of per-diem interest charged at consummation, and as a result the finance charge is understated by $200, the disclosed finance charge is considered accurate even though the understatement is not within the $100 tolerance of § <ref target="1026-18-d-1" reftype="internal">1026.18(d)(1)</ref>, and the finance charge was not labeled as an estimate. In this example, if in addition to the understatement related to the perdiem interest, a $90 fee is incorrectly omitted from the finance charge, causing it to be understated by a total of $290, the finance charge is considered accurate because the $90 fee is within the tolerance in § <ref target="1026-18-d-1" reftype="internal">1026.18(d)(1)</ref>.

    <content>Regulation X under RESPA, 12 CFR 1024.8, requires creditors to give consumers a settlement statement disclosing the costs associated with reverse mortgage loan transactions. Included on the settlement statement are mortgage insurance premiums collected at settlement, which are prepaid finance charges. In calculating the total amount of prepaid finance charges, creditors should use the amount for mortgage insurance listed on the line for mortgage insurance on the settlement statement (line 1003 on HUD–1 or HUD 1–A), without adjustment, even if the actual amount collected at settlement may vary because of RESPA’s escrow accounting rules. Figures for mortgage insurance disclosed in conformance with RESPA shall be deemed to be accurate for purposes of Regulation Z.</content>

    <content>In a limited number of circumstances, the beginning-payment date is unknown and difficult to determine at the time disclosures are made. For example, a consumer may become obligated on a credit contract that contemplates the delayed disbursement of funds based on a contingent event, such as the completion of repairs. Disclosures may also accompany loan checks that are sent by mail, in which case the initial disbursement and repayment dates are solely within the consumer’s control. In such cases, if the beginning-payment date is unknown the creditor may use an estimated date and label the disclosure as an estimate pursuant to § <ref target="1026-17-c" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)</ref>. Alternatively, the disclosure may refer to the occurrence of a particular event, for example, by disclosing that the beginning payment is due “30 days after the first loan disbursement.” This information also may be included with an estimated date to explain the basis for the creditor’s estimate.

    <content>The creditor may disclose an abbreviated payment schedule when the amount of each regularly scheduled payment (other than the first or last payment) includes an equal amount to be applied on principal and a finance charge computed by application of a rate to the decreasing unpaid balance. In addition, in transactions where payments vary because interest and principal are paid at different intervals, the two series of payments may be disclosed separately and the abbreviated payment schedule may be used for the interest payments. For example, in transactions with fixed quarterly principal payments and monthly interest payments based on the outstanding principal balance, the amount of the interest payments will change quarterly as principal declines. In such cases the creditor may treat the interest and principal payments as two separate series of payments, separately disclosing the number, amount, and due dates of principal payments, and, using the abbreviated payment schedule, the number, amount, and due dates of interest payments. This option may be used when interest and principal are scheduled to be paid on the same date of the month as well as on different dates of the month. The creditor using this alternative must disclose the dollar amount of the highest and lowest payments and make reference to the variation in payments.</content>

        <content>A charge determined by treating the loan balance as outstanding for a period of time after prepayment in full and applying the interest rate to such “balance,” even if the charge results from interest accrual amortization used for other payments in the transaction under the terms of the loan contract. “Interest accrual amortization” refers to the method by which the amount of interest due for each period (e.g., month) in a transaction’s term is determined. For example, “monthly interest accrual amortization” treats each payment as made on the scheduled, monthly due date even if it is actually paid early or late (until the expiration of any grace period). Thus, under the terms of a loan contract providing for monthly interest accrual amortization, if the amount of interest due on May 1 for the preceding month of April is $3,000, the loan contract will require payment of $3,000 in interest for the month of April whether the payment is made on April 20, on May 1, or on May 10. In this example, if the consumer prepays the loan in full on April 20 and if the accrued interest as of that date is $2,000, then assessment of a charge of $3,000 constitutes a prepayment penalty of $1,000 because the amount of interest actually earned through April 20 is only $2,000.</content>

        <content>A fee, such as an origination or other loan closing cost, that is waived by the creditor on the condition that the consumer does not prepay the loan. However, the term prepayment penalty does not include a waived bona fide third-party charge imposed by the creditor if the consumer pays all of a covered transaction’s principal before the date on which the principal is due sooner than 36 months after consummation. For example, assume that at consummation, the creditor waives $3,000 in closing costs to cover bona fide third-party charges but the terms of the loan agreement provide that the creditor may recoup the $3,000 in waived charges if the consumer repays the entire loan balance sooner than 36 months after consummation. The $3,000 charge is not a prepayment penalty. In contrast, for example, assume that at consummation, the creditor waives $3,000 in closing costs to cover bona fide third-party charges but the terms of the loan agreement provide that the creditor may recoup $4,500 in part to recoup waived charges, if the consumer repays the entire loan balance sooner than 36 months after consummation. The $3,000 that the creditor may impose to cover the waived bona fide thirdparty charges is not a prepayment penalty, but the additional $1,500 charge is a prepayment penalty and must be disclosed pursuant to § <ref target="1026-37-k-1" reftype="internal">1026.37(k)(1)</ref>.</content>

    <content>An estimated payment amount for taxes and insurance must be disclosed if the creditor will establish an escrow account for such amounts. If the escrow account will include amounts for items other than taxes and insurance, such as homeowners association dues, the creditor may but is not required to include such items in the estimate. When such estimated escrow payments must be disclosed in multiple columns of the table, such as for adjustable- and step-rate transactions, each column should use the same estimate for taxes and insurance except that the estimate should reflect changes in periodic mortgage insurance premiums or any functionally equivalent fee that are known to the creditor at the time the disclosure is made. The estimated amounts of mortgage insurance premiums or any functionally equivalent fee should be based on the declining principal balance that will occur as a result of changes to the interest rate that are assumed for purposes of disclosing those rates under § <ref target="1026-18-s-2" reftype="internal">1026.18(s)(2)</ref> and accompanying commentary. The payment amount must include estimated amounts for property taxes and premiums for mortgagerelated insurance required by the creditor, such as insurance against loss of or damage to property, or against liability arising out of the ownership or use of the property, or insurance protecting the creditor against the consumer’s default or other credit loss. Premiums for credit insurance, debt suspension and debt cancellation agreements, however, should not be included.

      <content>For purposes of § <ref target="1026-18-s" reftype="internal">1026.18(s)</ref>, “mortgage insurance or any functional equivalent” means the amounts identified in § <ref target="1026-4-b-5" reftype="internal">1026.4(b)(5)</ref>. “Mortgage guarantees” (such as a United <ref target="1026-2-a-26" reftype="term">States</ref> Department of Veterans Affairs or United <ref target="1026-2-a-26" reftype="term">States</ref> Department of Agriculture guarantee) provide coverage similar to mortgage insurance, even if not technically considered insurance under <ref target="1026-2-a-26" reftype="term">State</ref> or other applicable law. For purposes of § <ref target="1026-18-s" reftype="internal">1026.18(s)</ref>, “mortgage insurance or any functional equivalent” includes any mortgage guarantee. Payment amounts under § <ref target="1026-18-s-3-i" reftype="internal">1026.18(s)(3)(i)</ref> should reflect the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>’s mortgage insurance payments or any functionally equivalent fee until the date on which the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must automatically terminate coverage under applicable law, even though the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> may have a right to request that the insurance be cancelled earlier. The payment amount must reflect the terms of the legal obligation, as determined by applicable <ref target="1026-2-a-26" reftype="term">State</ref> or other law. For example, assume that under applicable law, mortgage insurance must terminate after the 130th scheduled monthly payment, and the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> collects at closing and places in escrow two months of premiums. If, under the legal obligation, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> will include mortgage insurance premiums in 130 payments and refund the escrowed payments when the insurance is terminated, payment amounts disclosed through the 130th payment should reflect premium payments. If, under the legal obligation, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> will apply the amount escrowed to the two final insurance payments, payments disclosed through the 128th payment should reflect premium payments. The escrow amount reflected on the disclosure should include mortgage insurance premiums even if they are not escrowed and even if there is no escrow account established for the transaction.</content>

    <content>See the commentary under § <ref target="1026-18-s-3-i-C" reftype="internal">1026.18(s)(3)(i)(C)</ref> for guidance on escrows for purposes of § <ref target="1026-18-s-6" reftype="internal">1026.18(s)(6)</ref>. Under that guidance, because mortgage insurance payments and functionally equivalent fees decline over a loan’s term, the payment amounts shown in the table should reflect the mortgage insurance payment and functionally equivalent fees that will be applicable at the time each disclosed periodic payment will be in effect. Accordingly, the disclosed mortgage insurance payment or functionally equivalent fee will be zero if it corresponds to a periodic payment that will occur after the creditor will be legally required to terminate mortgage insurance or any functional equivalent. On the other hand, because only one escrow amount is disclosed under § <ref target="1026-18-s-6" reftype="internal">1026.18(s)(6)</ref> for negative amortization loans and escrows that are not itemized in the payment amounts, the single escrow amount disclosed should reflect the mortgage insurance amount or any functionally equivalent fee that will be collected at the outset of the loan’s term, even though that amount will decline in the future and ultimately will be discontinued pursuant to the terms of the mortgage insurance policy.</content>

Section <ref target="1026-19-e-1-ii-A" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(1)(ii)(A)</ref> also provides that if the mortgage broker provides the required disclosures, it must comply with all relevant requirements of § <ref target="1026-19-e" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)</ref>. This means that “mortgage broker” should be read in the place of “creditor” for all provisions of § <ref target="1026-19-e" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)</ref>, except to the extent that such a reading would create responsibility for mortgage brokers under § <ref target="1026-19-f" reftype="internal">1026.19(f)</ref>.

The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must document this communication to satisfy the requirements of § <ref target="1026-25" reftype="internal">1026.25</ref>. For example, oral communication in person immediately upon delivery of the disclosures required by § <ref target="1026-19-e-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(1)(i)</ref> is sufficiently indicative of intent. Oral communication over the phone, written communication via email, or signing a pre-printed form are also sufficiently indicative of intent if such actions occur after receipt of the disclosures required by § <ref target="1026-19-e-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(1)(i)</ref>. However, a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>’s silence is not indicative of intent because it cannot be documented to satisfy the requirements of § <ref target="1026-25" reftype="internal">1026.25</ref>. For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> or third party may not deliver the disclosures, wait for some period of time for the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to respond, and then charge the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> a fee for an appraisal if the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> does not respond, even if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> or third party disclosed that it would do so.</content>

Non-specific lender credits are generalized payments from the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> that do not pay for a particular fee on the disclosures provided pursuant to § <ref target="1026-19-e-1" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(1)</ref>. Specific lender credits are specific payments, such as a credit, rebate, or reimbursement, from a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to pay for a specific fee. Nonspecific lender credits and specific lender credits are negative charges to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>. The actual total amount of lender credits, whether specific or non-specific, provided by the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> that is less than the estimated “lender credits” identified in § <ref target="1026-37-g-6-ii" reftype="internal">1026.37(g)(6)(ii)</ref> and disclosed pursuant to § <ref target="1026-19-e" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)</ref> is an increased charge to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> for purposes of determining good faith under § <ref target="1026-19-e-3-i" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(3)(i)</ref>. For example, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> discloses a $750 estimate for “lender credits” pursuant to § <ref target="1026-19-e" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)</ref>, but only $500 of lender credits is actually provided to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> has not complied with § <ref target="1026-19-e-3-i" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(3)(i)</ref> because the actual amount of lender credits provided is less than the estimated “lender credits” disclosed pursuant to § <ref target="1026-19-e" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)</ref>, and is therefore, an increased charge to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> for purposes of determining good faith under § <ref target="1026-19-e-3-i" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(3)(i)</ref>. However, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> discloses a $750 estimate for “lender credits” identified in § <ref target="1026-37-g-6-ii" reftype="internal">1026.37(g)(6)(ii)</ref> to cover the cost of a $750 appraisal fee, and the appraisal fee subsequently increases by $150, and the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> increases the amount of the lender credit by $150 to pay for the increase, the credit is not being revised in a way that violates the requirements of § <ref target="1026-19-e-3-i" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(3)(i)</ref> because, although the credit increased from the amount disclosed, the amount paid by the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> did not. However, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> discloses a $750 estimate for “lender credits” to cover the cost of a $750 appraisal fee, but subsequently reduces the credit by $50 because the appraisal fee decreased by $50, then the requirements of § <ref target="1026-19-e-3-i" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(3)(i)</ref> have been violated because, although the amount of the appraisal fee decreased, the amount of the lender credit decreased.

Recording fees are not charges for third-party services because recording fees are paid to the applicable government entity where the documents related to the mortgage transaction are recorded, and thus, the condition specified in § <ref target="1026-19-e-3-ii-B" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(3)(ii)(B)</ref> that the charge for third-party service not be paid to an <ref target="1026-32-b-5" reftype="term">affiliate</ref> of the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is inapplicable for recording fees. The condition specified in § <ref target="1026-19-e-3-ii-C" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(3)(ii)(C)</ref>, that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> permits the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to shop for the third-party service, is similarly inapplicable. Therefore, estimates of recording fees need only satisfy the condition specified in § <ref target="1026-19-e-3-ii-A" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(3)(ii)(A)</ref> to meet the requirements of § <ref target="1026-19-e-3-ii" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(3)(ii)</ref>.</content>

For example, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> relied on the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>’s income when providing the disclosures required under § <ref target="1026-19-e-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(1)(i)</ref>, and the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> represented to the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> had an annual income of $90,000, but underwriting determines that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>’s annual income is only $80,000, then this inaccuracy in information relied upon is a changed circumstance. Or, assume two co-applicants applied for a <ref target="1026-39-a-2" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref>. One applicant’s income was $30,000, while the other applicant’s income was $50,000. If the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> relied on the combined income of $80,000 when providing the disclosures required under § <ref target="1026-19-e-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(1)(i)</ref>, but the applicant earning $30,000 becomes unemployed during underwriting, thereby reducing the combined income to $50,000, then this change in information relied upon is a changed circumstance. A changed circumstance may also be the discovery of new information specific to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> or transaction that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> did not rely on when providing the original disclosures required under § <ref target="1026-19-e-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(1)(i)</ref>. For example, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> relied upon the value of the property in providing the disclosures required under § <ref target="1026-19-e-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(1)(i)</ref>, but during underwriting a neighbor of the seller, upon learning of the impending sale of the property, files a claim contesting the boundary of the property to be sold, then this new information specific to the transaction is a changed circumstance.</content>

For example, assume that, prior to providing the disclosures required by § <ref target="1026-19-e-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(1)(i)</ref>, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> believed that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> was eligible for a loan program that did not require an appraisal. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> then provides the estimated disclosures required by § <ref target="1026-19-e-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(1)(i)</ref>, which do not include an estimated charge for an appraisal. During underwriting it is discovered that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> was delinquent on <ref target="1026-39-a-2" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref> payments in the past, making the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> ineligible for the loan program originally identified on the estimated disclosures, but the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> remains eligible for a different program that requires an appraisal. If the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> provides revised disclosures reflecting the new program and including the appraisal fee, then the actual appraisal fee will be compared to the appraisal fee included in the revised disclosures to determine if the actual fee has increased above the estimated fee. However, if the revised disclosures also include increased estimates for title fees, the actual title fees must be compared to the original estimates assuming that the increased title fees do not stem from the change in eligibility or any other change warranting a revised disclosure.

              <content>An actual term is unknown if it is not reasonably available to the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> at the time the disclosures are made. The “reasonably available” standard requires that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>, acting in good faith, exercise due diligence in obtaining the information. For example, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must at a minimum utilize generally accepted calculation tools, but need not invest in the most sophisticated computer program to make a particular type of calculation. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> normally may rely on the representations of other parties in obtaining information. For example, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> might look to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> for the time of <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, to insurance companies for the cost of insurance, to realtors for taxes and escrow fees, or to a settlement agent for homeowner’s association dues or other information in connection with a real estate settlement.

To comply with this requirement, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must arrange for delivery accordingly. Section <ref target="1026-19-f-1-iii" reftype="internal">1026.19(f)(1)(iii)</ref> provides that, if any disclosures required under § <ref target="1026-19-f-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.19(f)(1)(i)</ref> are not provided to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> in person, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> is considered to have received the disclosures three <ref target="1026-2-a-6" reftype="term">business day</ref>s after they are delivered or placed in the mail. Thus, for example, if <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> is scheduled for Thursday, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> would satisfy the requirements of § <ref target="1026-19-f-1-ii-A" reftype="internal">1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(A)</ref> if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> places the disclosures in the mail on Thursday of the previous week, because, for the purposes of § <ref target="1026-19-f-1-ii" reftype="internal">1026.19(f)(1)(ii)</ref>, Saturday is a <ref target="1026-2-a-6" reftype="term">business day</ref>, pursuant to § <ref target="1026-2-a-6" reftype="internal">1026.2(a)(6)</ref>, and, pursuant to § <ref target="1026-19-f-1-iii" reftype="internal">1026.19(f)(1)(iii)</ref>, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> would be considered to have received the disclosures on the Monday before <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> is scheduled. See comment 19(f)(1)(iii)–1. A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> would not satisfy the requirements of § <ref target="1026-19-f-1-ii-A" reftype="internal">1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(A)</ref> in this example if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> places the disclosures in the mail on the Monday before <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>. However, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> in this example could satisfy the requirements of § <ref target="1026-19-f-1-ii-A" reftype="internal">1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(A)</ref> by delivering the disclosures on Monday, for instance, by way of electronic mail, provided the requirements of § <ref target="1026-38-t-3-iii" reftype="internal">1026.38(t)(3)(iii)</ref> relating to disclosures in electronic form are satisfied and assuming that each weekday is a <ref target="1026-2-a-6" reftype="term">business day</ref>, and provided that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> obtains evidence that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> received the emailed disclosures on Monday.

Based on the average cost to the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> from the May to August period, the average charge to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> for the September to December period should be $125. However, while the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> spent $700 more than it collected during the May to August period, it collected $1,300 more than it spent from January to August. In cases such as these, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> remains responsible for ensuring that the amount collected from <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumers</ref> does not exceed the total amounts paid for the corresponding <ref target="1026-42-b-1" reftype="term">settlement services</ref> over time. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may develop a variety of methods that achieve this outcome. For example, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may choose to refund the proportional overage paid to the affected <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumers</ref>. Or the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may choose to factor in the excess amount collected to decrease the average charge for an upcoming period. Although any method may comply with this requirement, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is deemed to have complied if it defines a six-month time period and establishes a rolling monthly period of reevaluation. For example, assume a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> defines a six-month time period from January 1 to June 30 and the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> uses the average charge starting July 1. If, at the end of July, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> recalculates the average cost from February 1 to July 31, and then uses the recalculated average cost for transactions starting August 1, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> complies with the requirements of § <ref target="1026-19-f-3-ii" reftype="internal">1026.19(f)(3)(ii)</ref>, even if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> actually collected more from <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumers</ref> than was paid to providers over time.</content>

            <content>A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may prospectively adjust average charges if it develops a statistically reliable and accurate method for doing so. For example, assume a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> calculates average charges based on two time periods: winter (October 1 to March 31), and summer (April 1 to September 30).

            <content>An average charge may not be used for any charge that varies according to the loan amount or property value. For example, an average charge may not be used for a transfer tax if the transfer tax is calculated as a percentage of the loan amount or property value. Average charges also may not be used for any insurance premium. For example, average charges may not be used for title insurance or for either the upfront premium or initial escrow deposit for hazard insurance.</content>

The documentation must support the components and methods of calculation. For example, if a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> calculates an average charge for a particular county recording fee by simply averaging all of the relevant fees paid in the prior month, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> need only retain the receipts for the individual recording fees, a ledger demonstrating that the total amount received did not exceed the total amount paid over time, and a document detailing the calculation.

Section <ref target="1026-19-f-4-i" reftype="internal">1026.19(f)(4)(i)</ref> requires disclosure of the items that relate to the seller’s transaction.

For example, if the loan product is an adjustable rate with an introductory rate that is fixed for the first five years of the loan term and then adjusts every three years starting in year six, and then annually starting in year fifteen, the disclosure required by § <ref target="1026-37-a-10" reftype="internal">1026.37(a)(10)</ref> would still be “5/3 Adjustable Rate.”</content>

              <content>Some loan products, such as “payment option” loans, permit the borrower to make payments that are insufficient to cover all of the interest accrued, and the unpaid interest is added to the principal balance.

              <content>A charge determined by treating the loan balance as outstanding for a period of time after prepayment in full and applying the interest rate to such “balance,” even if the charge results from interest accrual amortization used for other payments in the transaction under the terms of the loan contract. “Interest accrual amortization” refers to the method by which the amount of interest due for each period (e.g., month) in a transaction’s term is determined. For example, “monthly interest accrual amortization” treats each payment as made on the scheduled, monthly due date even if it is actually paid early or late (until the expiration of any <ref target="1026-54-a-2" reftype="term">grace period</ref>). Thus, under the terms of a loan contract providing for monthly interest accrual amortization, if the amount of interest due on May 1 for the preceding month of April is $3,000, the loan contract will require payment of $3,000 in interest for the month of April whether the payment is made on April 20, on May 1, or on May 10. In this example, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> prepays the loan in full on April 20 and if the accrued interest as of that date is $2,000, then assessment of a charge of $3,000 constitutes a <ref target="1026-32-b-6-i" reftype="term">prepayment penalty</ref> of $1,000 because the amount of interest actually earned through April 20 is only $2,000.</content>

Such calculation should take into account any initial discounted or premium interest rate. For example, for an adjustable rate transaction that has a discounted interest rate during an initial five-year period, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> makes the calculation using a composite rate based on the rate in effect during the initial five-year period and, thereafter, the <ref target="1026-18-s-7-vi" reftype="term">fully-indexed rate</ref>, unless otherwise required by applicable law. For guidance on calculation of the amount of mortgage insurance premiums to disclose on the table required by § <ref target="1026-37-c" reftype="internal">1026.37(c)</ref>, see § <ref target="1026-37-c-2-ii" reftype="internal">1026.37(c)(2)(ii)</ref> and its commentary.

After the end of the <ref target="1026-18-s-7-v" reftype="term">negative amortization</ref> period, the general rule under § <ref target="1026-37-c-2-i-A" reftype="internal">1026.37(c)(2)(i)(A)</ref> regarding assumptions of interest rate changes for the maximum principal and interest payment to be disclosed applies from such interest rate.

If there is only one adjustment of the periodic payment under the terms of the legal obligation (for example, if the loan has an interest only period for the first 60 payments and there are no adjustments to the payment after the end of the interest only period), the disclosure should state: “No subsequent changes.” If the loan has graduated increases in the regular periodic payment every 12th payment, the disclosure should state: “Every year.” If the frequency of adjustments to the periodic payment may change under the terms of the legal obligation, the disclosure should state the smallest period of adjustments that may occur. For example, if an increase in the periodic payment is scheduled every sixth payment for 36 payments, and then every 12th payment for the next 24 payments, the disclosure should state: “Every 6th payment.”</content>

            <content>The disclosure required by § <ref target="1026-37-i-5" reftype="internal">1026.37(i)(5)</ref> must state the larger of the maximum scheduled or maximum potential amount of a regular periodic principal and interest payment under the terms of the legal obligation, as well as the payment number of the first periodic principal and interest payment that can reach such amount. If the disclosed payment is scheduled, § <ref target="1026-37-i-5" reftype="internal">1026.37(i)(5)</ref> requires that the disclosure state the payment number when such payment is reached with the preceding text, “starting at.” If the disclosed payment is only potential, as may be the case for a loan that permits optional payments, the disclosure states the earliest payment number when such payment can be reached with the preceding text, “as early as.” Section <ref target="1026-37-i-5" reftype="internal">1026.37(i)(5)</ref> requires that the first possible periodic principal and interest payment that can reach the maximum be disclosed. For example, for a fixed interest rate optional-payment loan with scheduled payments that result in <ref target="1026-18-s-7-v" reftype="term">negative amortization</ref> under the terms of the legal obligation, the maximum periodic payment disclosed should be based on the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> having elected to make the periodic payments that would increase the principal balance to the maximum amount at the latest time possible before the loan begins to fully amortize, which would cause the periodic principal and interest payment to be the maximum possible. For example, if the earliest payment that could reach the maximum principal balance was the 41st payment at which time the loan would begin to amortize and the periodic principal and interest payment would be recalculated, but the last payment that permitted the principal balance to increase was the 60th payment, the disclosure required by § <ref target="1026-37-i-5" reftype="internal">1026.37(i)(5)</ref> must assume the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> only reaches the maximum principal balance at the 60th payment because this would result in the maximum possible principal and interest payment under the terms of the legal obligation. The disclosure must state the maximum periodic principal and interest payment based on this assumption and state “as early as the 61st payment.”</content>

In many cases, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> cannot determine, at the time the disclosure is made, whether a loan may be assumable at a future date on its original terms. For example, the assumption clause commonly used in mortgages sold to the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation conditions an assumption on a variety of factors, such as the creditworthiness of the subsequent borrower, the potential for impairment of the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>’s security, and the execution of an assumption <ref target="1026-58-b-1" reftype="term">agreement</ref> by the subsequent borrower.

              <content>The clear and conspicuous standard requires that the disclosures required by § <ref target="1026-37" reftype="internal">1026.37</ref> be legible and in a readily understandable form. Section <ref target="1026-37-o-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.37(o)(1)(i)</ref> requires that the disclosures be grouped together and segregated from everything else. For example, <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> may not add additional pages in between the pages of the Loan Estimate, or attach to the Loan Estimate additional pages that are not provided for under § <ref target="1026-37" reftype="internal">1026.37</ref> after the last page of the Loan Estimate. As required by § <ref target="1026-37-o-3-i" reftype="internal">1026.37(o)(3)(i)</ref>, the disclosures for any transaction that is a federally related <ref target="1026-39-a-2" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref> under Regulation X, 12 CFR 1024.2, must be made using the standard form H–24 of appendix H to this part. Accordingly, use of that form constitutes compliance with the clear and conspicuous and segregation requirements of § <ref target="1026-37-o" reftype="internal">1026.37(o)</ref>. In addition, § <ref target="1026-37-o-1-ii" reftype="internal">1026.37(o)(1)(ii)</ref> requires <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> to disclose on the Loan Estimate only the information required by § <ref target="1026-37-a" reftype="internal">1026.37(a)</ref> through (n), except as otherwise provided by § <ref target="1026-37-o" reftype="internal">1026.37(o)</ref>, and in the same order, and positioned relative to the master headings, headings, subheadings, labels, and similar designations in the same manner, as shown in form H–24, set forth in appendix H to this part. For example, <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> may not use form H–24, but include in the Loan Terms table under the subheading “Can this amount increase after closing?” information that is not required by § <ref target="1026-37-b-6" reftype="internal">1026.37(b)(6)</ref>.</content>

The <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> may have a number of options with respect to the final payment, including, among other things, retaining the property and making the final payment, refinancing the final payment, or transferring the property to the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> in lieu of the final payment. Such transactions may have some of the characteristics of lease transactions subject to Regulation M (12 CFR part 1013), but are considered credit transactions where the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> assumes the indicia of ownership, including the risks, burdens, and benefits of ownership, upon <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>.

In addition, § <ref target="1026-37-o-2" reftype="internal">1026.37(o)(2)</ref> requires that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> include the designation of “estimated” for all headings, subheading, labels, and similar designations required by § <ref target="1026-37" reftype="internal">1026.37</ref> for which form H–24 contains the “estimated” designation in such heading, subheading, label, or similar designation. The disclosures required by § <ref target="1026-37" reftype="internal">1026.37</ref> comply with the requirement to be in a format substantially similar to form H–24 when provided on letter size (8.5″ x 11″) paper.</content>

These statements are more prominent than the other disclosures under § <ref target="1026-38-e" reftype="internal">1026.38(e)</ref>. The statement of whether the estimated and final amounts are different, stated as a “Yes” or “No” in capital letters and in boldface, under the subheading “Did this change?,” as shown on forms H– 25(E) and H–25(G) of appendix H to this part, complies with the requirement to state whether the amounts are different more prominently. Such statement of “No” satisfies the requirement to state that the estimated and final amounts are equal, and these sections do not provide for any narrative text to be included with such statement. The prominence requirement also requires that, in the event an increase or decrease in costs has occurred, certain words within the narrative text to be included under the subheading “Did this change?” for a “Yes” answer are displayed more prominently than other disclosures. For example, under § <ref target="1026-38-e-2-iii-A" reftype="internal">1026.38(e)(2)(iii)(A)</ref>, this more prominent statement could take the form of the phrases “Total Loan Costs (D)” and “Total Other Costs (I)” being shown in boldface, as shown on forms H–25(E) and H–25(G) of appendix H to this part. See comment 38(e)–4 for further guidance regarding the prominence of such statements.</content>

          <content>The dollar amounts disclosed under § <ref target="1026-38" reftype="internal">1026.38</ref> generally are shown to two decimal places unless otherwise required. See comment 38(t)(4)–1. As a result, any “Final” amount that is disclosed in the alternative “Calculating Cash to Close” table under § <ref target="1026-38-e" reftype="internal">1026.38(e)</ref> is shown to two decimal places unless otherwise required. Pursuant to § <ref target="1026-38-t-4-i-C" reftype="internal">1026.38(t)(4)(i)(C)</ref>, however, any “Loan Estimate” amount that is disclosed in the alternative “Calculating Cash to Close” table under § <ref target="1026-38-e" reftype="internal">1026.38(e)</ref> is shown to the nearest dollar amount, and thus matches the corresponding estimated amount disclosed on the Loan Estimate’s “Calculating Cash to Close” table under § <ref target="1026-37-h" reftype="internal">1026.37(h)</ref>, which is shown to the nearest whole dollar pursuant to § <ref target="1026-37-o-4-i-A" reftype="internal">1026.37(o)(4)(i)(A)</ref>. For this reason, a “Final” amount shown to two decimal places could be a larger number than its corresponding “Estimate” amount shown to the nearest whole dollar, when, in fact, the apparent increase is due solely to rounding. Therefore, for purposes of § <ref target="1026-38-e-1-iii" reftype="internal">1026.38(e)(1)(iii)</ref>, (2)(iii), (3)(iii), and (4)(iii), each statement of a change between the amounts disclosed on the Loan Estimate and the Closing Disclosure is based on the actual, nonrounded estimate that would have been disclosed on the Loan Estimate under § <ref target="1026-37-h" reftype="internal">1026.37(h)</ref> if it had been shown to two decimal places rather than a whole dollar amount. For example, if the “Loan Estimate” amount of “Total Closing Costs” disclosed under § <ref target="1026-38-e-2-i" reftype="internal">1026.38(e)(2)(i)</ref> is $12,500, and the “Final” amount of “Total Closing Costs” disclosed under § <ref target="1026-38-e-2-ii" reftype="internal">1026.38(e)(2)(ii)</ref> is $12,500.35, then even though the table would appear to show a $0.35 increase in “Total Closing Costs,” no statement of such increase is given under § <ref target="1026-38-e-2-iii" reftype="internal">1026.38(e)(2)(iii)</ref> so long as the actual, non-rounded estimate (i.e., the estimated amount of “Total Closing Costs” that would have been shown on the Loan Estimate to two decimal places) is equal to $12,500.35.</content>

These statements are more prominent than the other disclosures under § <ref target="1026-38-i" reftype="internal">1026.38(i)</ref>. The statement of whether the estimated and final amounts are different, stated as a “Yes” or “No” in capital letters and in boldface font, under the subheading “Did this change?,” as shown on form H–25 of appendix H to this part, complies with the requirement to state whether the amounts are different more prominently. Such statement of “No” satisfies the requirement to state that the estimated and final amounts are equal, and these sections do not provide for any narrative text to be included with such statement. The prominence requirement also requires that, in the event an increase or decrease in costs has occurred, certain words within the narrative text to be included under the subheading “Did this change?” for a “Yes” answer are displayed more prominently than other disclosures. For example, under § <ref target="1026-38-i-1-iii-A" reftype="internal">1026.38(i)(1)(iii)(A)</ref>, this more prominent statement could take the form of the phrases “Total Loan Costs” and “Total Other Costs” being shown in boldface, as shown on form H–25 of appendix H to this part.

            <content>The dollar amounts disclosed under § <ref target="1026-38" reftype="internal">1026.38</ref> generally are shown to two decimal places unless otherwise required. See comment 38(t)(4)–1. As a result, any “Final” amount that is disclosed in the “Calculating Cash to Close” table under § <ref target="1026-38-i" reftype="internal">1026.38(i)</ref> is shown to two decimal places unless otherwise required. Pursuant to § <ref target="1026-38-t-4-i-C" reftype="internal">1026.38(t)(4)(i)(C)</ref>, however, any “Loan Estimate” amount that is disclosed in the “Calculating Cash to Close” table under § <ref target="1026-38-i" reftype="internal">1026.38(i)</ref> is shown rounded to the nearest dollar amount, and thus matches the corresponding estimated amount disclosed on the Loan Estimate’s “Calculating Cash to Close” table under § <ref target="1026-37-h" reftype="internal">1026.37(h)</ref>, which is shown rounded to the nearest whole dollar pursuant to § <ref target="1026-37-o-4-i-A" reftype="internal">1026.37(o)(4)(i)(A)</ref>. For this reason, a “Final” amount shown to two decimal places could be a larger number than its corresponding “Loan Estimate” amount shown rounded to the nearest whole dollar, when, in fact, the apparent increase is due solely to rounding. Therefore, for purposes of § <ref target="1026-38-i-1-iii" reftype="internal">1026.38(i)(1)(iii)</ref>, (2)(iii), (3)(iii), (4)(iii), (5)(iii), (6)(iii), (7)(iii), and (8)(iii), each statement of a change between the amounts disclosed on the Loan Estimate and the Closing Disclosure is based on the actual, nonrounded estimate that would have been disclosed on the Loan Estimate under § <ref target="1026-37-h" reftype="internal">1026.37(h)</ref> if it had been shown to two decimal places rather than a whole dollar amount. For example, if the “Loan Estimate” amount of “Total Closing Costs” disclosed under § <ref target="1026-38-i-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.38(i)(1)(i)</ref> is $12,500, and the “Final” amount of “Total Closing Costs” disclosed under § <ref target="1026-38-i-1-ii" reftype="internal">1026.38(i)(1)(ii)</ref> is $12,500.35, then even though the table would appear to show a $0.35 increase in “Total Closing Costs,” no statement of such increase is given under § <ref target="1026-38-i-1-iii" reftype="internal">1026.38(i)(1)(iii)</ref> so long as the actual, non-rounded estimate (i.e., the estimated amount of “Total Closing Costs” that would have been shown on the Loan Estimate to two decimal places) is equal to $12,500.35.</content>

            <content>Form H–25 of appendix H to this part includes the contact information required to be disclosed under § <ref target="1026-38-r" reftype="internal">1026.38(r)</ref> generally in a five-column tabular format (i.e., there are columns from left to right that disclose the contact information for the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>, mortgage broker, <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>’s real estate broker, seller’s real estate broker, and settlement agent). Columns are left blank where no such <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> is participating in the transaction. For example, if there is no mortgage broker involved in the transaction, the column for the mortgage broker is left blank. Conversely, in the event the transaction involves more than one of each such <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> (e.g., two sellers’ real estate brokers splitting a commission), the space in the contact information table provided on form H–25 of appendix H to this part may be altered to accommodate the information for such persons, provided that the information required by § <ref target="1026-38-o" reftype="internal">1026.38(o)</ref>,(p),(q),(r) and (s) is disclosed on the same page as illustrated by form H–25. If the space provided on form H–25 does not accommodate the addition of such information, an additional table to accommodate the information may be provided on a separate page, with an appropriate reference to the additional table. A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> or settlement agent may also omit a column on the table that is inapplicable or, if necessary, replace an inapplicable column with the contact information for the additional <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref>.</content>

The NMLSR ID is a unique number or other identifier that is generally assigned by the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System &amp; Registry (NMLSR) to individuals registered or licensed through NMLSR to provide loan originating services (for more information, see the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (SAFE Act) sections 1503(3) and (12) and 1504, 12 U.S.C. 5102(3) and (12) and 5103, and its implementing regulations (i.e., 12 CFR 1007.103(a) and <ref target="CFR:12-1008-103-a-2" reftype="external">1008.103(a)(2)</ref>). An entity may also have an NMLSR ID.

    <content>On the other hand, if the creditor elects to disclose the construction and permanent phases as a single transaction, where interest is payable on the amount actually advanced for the time it is outstanding, the construction phase must be disclosed pursuant to appendix D, part II.C.1, which provides that the creditor shall disclose the repayment schedule without reflecting the number or amounts of payments of interest only that are made during the construction phase. Appendix D also provides, however, that creditors must disclose (outside of the table) the fact that interest payments must be made and the timing of such payments. The interest rate and payment summary table disclosed under § <ref target="1026-18-s" reftype="internal">1026.18(s)</ref> in such cases must reflect only the permanent phase of the transaction. Therefore, in determining the rates and payments that must be disclosed in the columns of the table, creditors should apply the requirements of § <ref target="1026-18-s" reftype="internal">1026.18(s)</ref> to the permanent phase only. For example, under § <ref target="1026-18-s-2-i-A" reftype="internal">1026.18(s)(2)(i)(A)</ref> or § <ref target="1026-18-s-2-i-B" reftype="internal">1026.18(s)(2)(i)(B)</ref>(1), as applicable, the creditor should disclose the interest rate corresponding to the first installment due under the permanent phase and not any rate applicable during the construction phase.</content>

The loan amount is $44,900, payable in 360 monthly installments at a simple interest rate of 14.75%. Two points ($898), as well as an initial guarantee insurance premium of $225.00, are included in the prepaid finance charge.
