        <content>The requirement that a finance charge may be computed and imposed from time to time on the outstanding balance means that there is no specific amount financed for the plan for which the finance charge, total of payments, and payment schedule can be calculated.

An issuer demonstrates that it proposes to connect the card to a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> plan by, for example, including promotional materials about <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> features or account agreements and disclosures required by § 1026.6. The issuer will violate the rule against unsolicited issuance if, for example, at the time the card is sent a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> plan can be accessed by the card or the recipient of the unsolicited card has been preapproved for <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> that the recipient can access by contacting the issuer and activating the card.</content>

      <title>4(b)(2)</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1026.4(b) provides examples of the types of charges that are finance charges, except if those charges are specifically excluded under existing § 1026.4(c) through (e). In particular, existing § 1026.4(b)(2) provides that examples of finance charges generally include service, transaction, activity, and carrying charges. However, the Board added a partial exception to this example stating that any charge imposed on a checking or other transaction account, such a service or transaction account charge, is only a finance charge to the extent that the charge exceeds the charge for a similar account without a credit feature. Existing comment 4(b)(2)-1 similarly provides that a checking or transaction account charge imposed in connection with a credit feature is a finance charge under existing § 1026.4(b)(2) to the extent the charge exceeds the charge for a similar account without a credit feature. If a charge for a checking or transaction account with a credit feature does not exceed the charge for an account without a credit feature, the charge is not a finance charge under existing § 1026.4(b)(2). For purposes of existing § 1026.4(b)(2), a per transaction fee imposed on a checking account with a credit feature (&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;i.e.,&lt;/em&gt; overdraft line of credit where the financial institution has agreed in writing to pay an overdraft) can be compared with a fee imposed for paying or returning each item on a similar account without a credit feature. Thus, if a per transaction fee imposed on a checking account with a credit feature for accessing credit does not exceed the fee for paying an overdraft or NSF fee on the checking account with no credit feature, the per transaction fee imposed on the checking account with the credit feature is not a finance charge under existing § 1026.4(b)(2).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The proposal would have set forth a different rule for when fees imposed on prepaid accounts would have been finance charges than the standard set forth in existing § 1026.4(b)(2). Specifically, proposed § 1026.4(b)(2)(ii) would have provided that any charge imposed in connection with an extension of credit, for carrying a credit balance, or for credit availability would have been a finance charge where that fee is imposed on a prepaid account in connection with credit accessed by a prepaid card, regardless of whether the creditor imposes the same, greater, or lesser charge on the withdrawal of funds from the prepaid account, to have access to the prepaid account, or when credit is not extended. Proposed comment 4(b)(2)-1.ii through iv, would have clarified the rule set forth in proposed § 1026.4(b)(2)(ii). The existing language in § 1026.4(b)(2) would have been moved to proposed § 1026.4(b)(2)(i). The existing language in comment 4(b)(2)-1 would have been moved to proposed comment 4(b)(2)-1.i.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received substantial comments on the circumstances in which fees imposed on prepaid accounts should be considered finance charges under § 1026.4. These comments are discussed in the section-by-section to § 1026.4(b)(11) below. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.4(b)(11), new § 1026.4(b)(11) and related commentary set forth guidance regarding the circumstances in which a fee is a finance charge for credit offered in connection with a prepaid account. Thus, the Bureau has not adopted proposed § 1026.4(b)(2)(ii) and the changes to comment 4(b)(2)-1 as proposed.&lt;footnote ref="617"&gt;The proposal would have provided that the term “credit card” includes an account number that is not a prepaid card that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan that allows deposits directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. Proposed § 1026.4(b)(2)(ii) and comment 4(b)(2)-1.ii through iv would have set forth the rule for when a fee imposed on a prepaid account is a finance charge in connection with credit accessed by such account numbers. For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) above, the final rule does not adopt the proposed changes to § 1026.4(b)(2)(ii) and comment 4(b)(2)-1.ii through iv related to these account numbers.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             Instead, the Bureau is revising § 1026.4(b)(2) and comment 4(b)(2)-1 to provide that final § 1026.4(b)(2) does not apply to prepaid accounts as defined in § 1026.61. In addition, the Bureau is adding new comment 4(b)(2)-2 to state that fees or charges related to credit offered in connection with prepaid accounts as defined in § 1026.61 are discussed in new §§ 1026.4(b)(11) and 1026.61, and related commentary.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1026.58 Internet Posting of Credit Card Agreements</title>
      <analysisParagraph>TILA section 122(d), implemented by existing § 1026.58, generally requires card issuers to post their card agreements on the internet and to provide those agreements to the Bureau. Separately, as part of this final rule, the Bureau is adopting similar provisions for prepaid accounts in final Regulation E § 1005.19. Although the Bureau is not revising § 1026.58, it notes that the requirements of § 1026.58 and those of Regulation E § 1005.19 are distinct and independent of one another. In other words, issuers must comply with both as appropriate. The Bureau notes, however, that it does not believe it is likely that any agreement will constitute both a credit card agreement and a prepaid account agreement and thus be required to be submitted under both § 1026.58 and Regulation E § 1005.19. Given the requirement in new § 1026.61(b) that credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards generally must be structured as separate subaccounts or accounts distinct from the prepaid asset account, in conjunction with the account-opening disclosure requirements in existing § 1026.6 and the initial disclosure requirements in existing Regulation E § 1005.7(b) as well as final § 1005.18(f)(1), the Bureau believes it is unlikely that an issuer would use a single agreement to provide all such disclosures for both a prepaid account and for a covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau reminds credit card issuers that while final Regulation E § 1005.19(f) provides a delayed effective date of October 1, 2018 to submit prepaid account agreements to the Bureau, the requirement to submit credit card agreements for covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards that are credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan becomes effective with the rest of this final rule on October 1, 2017.</analysisParagraph>

             Regulation Z defines the term “open-end credit” in existing § 1026.2(a)(20) to mean consumer “credit” extended by a “creditor” under a “plan” in which (1) the creditor reasonably contemplates repeated transactions; (2) the creditor may impose a “finance charge” from time to time on an outstanding unpaid balance; and (3) the amount of credit that may be extended to the consumer during the term of the plan (up to any limit set by the creditor) is generally made available to the extent that any outstanding balance is repaid. Thus, to have open-end credit under Regulation Z, there must be (1) consumer “credit;” (2) that is extended under a “plan;” (3) where the person extending the credit may impose a “finance charge” from time to time on an outstanding unpaid balance; (4) the person extending the credit is a “creditor;” (5) the person extending credit reasonably contemplates repeated transactions; and (6) the amount of credit that may be extended to the consumer during the term of the plan (up to any limit set by the creditor) is generally made available to the extent that any outstanding balance is repaid.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>With respect to a credit accessed by a prepaid card that would have been a credit card under the proposal, the proposal would have provided additional guidance on the meaning of the following three terms used in the definition of “open-end credit:” (1) “credit;” (2) “plan;” and (3) “finance charge.” For a discussion of the proposal and the final rule related to the term “credit,” see the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(14) above. The term “plan” is discussed below. For a discussion of the proposal and the final rule related to the term “finance charge,” see below and the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.4.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Definition of “Plan”</title>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;The Bureau's proposal.&lt;/em&gt; The term “plan” currently is discussed in current comment 2(a)(20)-2, which provides in relevant part that the term “plan” connotes a contractual arrangement between the creditor and the consumer. The proposal would have revised current comment 2(a)(20)-2 to provide additional guidance on what constitutes a plan with respect to credit extended through paying overdrafts in connection with prepaid accounts. Under the proposal, a new comment 2(a)(20)-2.ii would have provided that with respect to credit accessed by a prepaid card, a plan would mean a program where the consumer is obligated contractually to repay any credit extended by the creditor. The proposal would have provided that a plan includes a program under which a creditor routinely pays transactions when a consumer has insufficient or unavailable funds in a prepaid account and the consumer is obligated contractually to repay those transactions. Under the proposal, such a program would have constituted a plan notwithstanding that the creditor retains discretion not to pay such transactions, the creditor does not pay transactions once the consumer has exceeded a certain amount of credit, or the creditor only pays transactions where there were sufficient or available funds to cover the amount of the transaction at the time the transaction was authorized but not sufficient or available funds to cover the amount of the transaction at the time the transaction is paid.
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>To accommodate the proposed changes, the proposal also would have made several technical revisions to comment 2(a)(20)-2. Specifically, the first sentence of the existing language in comment 2(a)(20)-2 would have been moved to proposed comment 2(a)(20)-2.i, and the remaining language of the existing comment would have been moved to proposed comment 2(a)(20)-2.iv.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Comments received and the final rule.&lt;/em&gt; The Bureau did not receive specific comment on the proposed changes to comment 2(a)(20)-2. Consistent with the proposal, the Bureau is moving the first sentence of the existing language in comment 2(a)(20)-2 to new comment 20(a)(20)-2.i. The Bureau also is moving the remaining language of the existing comment to new comment 2(a)(20)-2.iii.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also is modifying the proposed language in new comment 2(a)(20)-2.ii to be consistent with the provisions set forth in § 1026.61.&lt;footnote ref="613"&gt;The proposal would have provided that the term “credit card” includes an account number that is not a prepaid card that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan that allows deposits directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. Proposed comment 2(a)(20)-2.iii would been added to provide guidance on when depositing credit proceeds into a prepaid account would be considered extending credit under a plan. For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) above, the final rule does not adopt proposed comment 2(a)(20)-2.iii related to these account numbers.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             Specifically, the final rule does not adopt an example contained in proposed comment 2(a)(20)-2.ii where credit is accessed by a prepaid card where the credit is extended on the prepaid account as a negative balance. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(b) below, a negative balance feature accessible by a prepaid card triggers application of the credit card rules under the final rule for purposes of coverage except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4). However, new § 1026.61(b) requires that an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner in connection with a prepaid account (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)) must be structured as a separate subaccount or account, distinct from the prepaid asset account, in order to facilitate transparency and compliance with various elements of Regulation Z. Such a separate credit feature is defined as a “covered separate credit feature” under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i). Accordingly, the Bureau is revising new comment 20(a)(2)-2.ii from the proposal to discuss a situation where a hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses a “covered separate credit feature” under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i) rather than credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account that would violate new § 1026.61(b).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Specifically, under the final rule, new comment 2(a)(20)-2.ii provides that with respect to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in § 1026.61, a plan includes a program under which a creditor routinely extends credit where the prepaid card can be used from time to time to draw, transfer, or authorize the draw or transfer of credit from a covered separate credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers, and the consumer is obligated contractually to repay those credit transactions. Such a program constitutes a plan notwithstanding that, for example, the creditor has not agreed in writing to extend credit for those transactions, the creditor retains discretion not to extend credit for those transactions, or the creditor does not extend credit for those transactions once the consumer has exceeded a certain amount of credit. The comment also cross-references new § 1026.61(a) and related commentary for guidance on the applicability of this regulation to credit accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to the programs described above, the Bureau believes these programs are plans notwithstanding that, for example, the person offering the program reserves the right not to extend credit on individual transactions. The Bureau believes that the person's reservation of such discretion in connection with covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards does not connote the absence of an open-end credit plan. If consumers using covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards must agree to repay the debt created by an overdraft or advance, a contractual arrangement between the creditor and the consumer exists. The Bureau notes that credit card issuers similarly reserve the right to reject individual transactions, and thus the Bureau believes that automated overdraft services are comparable.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Finance Charge Imposed From Time to Time on an Outstanding Unpaid Balance</title>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;The Bureau's proposal.&lt;/em&gt; In Regulation Z, credit will not meet the definition of “open-end credit” unless the person extending the credit may impose a “finance charge” from time to time on an outstanding unpaid balance. Existing comment 2(a)(20)-4 provides that the requirement that a finance charge may be computed and imposed from time to time on the outstanding balance means that there is no specific amount financed for the plan for which the finance charge, total of payments, and payment schedule can be calculated. This comment also provides that a plan may meet the definition of open-end credit even though a finance charge is not normally imposed, provided the creditor has the right, under the plan, to impose a finance charge from time to time on the outstanding balance.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The term “finance charge” generally is defined in existing § 1026.4 to mean “the cost of consumer credit as a dollar amount” and it includes any charge payable directly or indirectly by the consumer and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to or as a condition of the extension of credit. The term does not include any charge of a type payable in a comparable cash transaction.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The proposal would have revised various components of the definition of finance charge in existing § 1026.4 and its commentary to (1) distinguish credit provided in connection with prepaid accounts addressed by the proposal from overdraft services on checking accounts, which is subject to a different rulemaking process; and (2) broaden the definition of “finance charge,” as applied in the prepaid context, to assure broad coverage of the credit card rules to credit plans accessed by prepaid cards that would have been credit cards under the proposal and to better reflect the full cost of credit. Consistent with this approach, the proposal also would have added proposed comment 2(a)(20)-4.ii to state that with respect to credit accessed by a prepaid card (including a prepaid card that is solely an account number), any service, transaction, activity, or carrying charges imposed on a credit account, and any such charges imposed on a prepaid account related to an extension of credit, carrying a credit balance, or credit availability, generally would be finance charges. Such charges would have included periodic participation fees for the credit plan and transaction charges imposed in connection with a credit extension. In addition, proposed comment 2(a)(20)-4.ii would have provided that with respect to that credit, such service, transaction, activity, or carrying charges would constitute finance charges imposed from time to time on an outstanding unpaid balance if there is no specific amount financed for the plan for which the finance charge, total of payments, and payment schedule can be calculated. The proposal also would have moved the existing language of comment 2(a)(20)-4 to proposed comment 2(a)(20)-4.i.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Comments received and the final rule.&lt;/em&gt; The Bureau did not receive specific comments on the proposed changes to existing comment 2(a)(20)-4. Consistent with the general approach in the proposal, the Bureau is revising various components of the definition of finance charge in existing § 1026.4 and its commentary to (1) distinguish credit provided in connection with prepaid accounts addressed by the final rule from overdraft services on checking accounts, which is subject to a different rulemaking process; and (2) broaden the definition of “finance charge,” as applied in the prepaid context, to assure broad coverage of the credit card rules to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards and to better reflect the full cost of credit. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 and a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adding a new § 1026.4(b)(11) and related commentary to provide guidance as to the application of Regulation Z to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards. In particular, § 1026.4(b)(11) and related commentary describe how to treat charges that may be imposed on the separate credit subaccount or account as compared to charges that may be imposed on the prepaid asset feature. The commentary to new § 1026.4(b)(11) also provides guidance as to the treatment of fees imposed on the prepaid account in relation to credit features accessible by prepaid cards that are not credit cards under the final rule.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting changes to the commentary concerning the prong of the open-end credit definition in existing § 1026.2(a)(20) concerning the creditor's ability to impose finance charges from time to time on an outstanding unpaid balance, consistent with the general approach adopted in final §§ 1026.4 and new 1026.61. Specifically, the Bureau is moving the existing language of comment 2(a)(20)-4 to new comment 2(a)(20)-4.i. The Bureau also is adding new comment 2(a)(20)-4.ii but revises this comment from the proposal to reflect changes from the proposal set forth in the final rule under final §§ 1026.4 and new 1026.61.&lt;footnote ref="614"&gt;The proposal would have provided that the term “credit card” includes an account number that is not a prepaid card that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan that allows deposits directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. Proposed comment 2(a)(20)-4.ii would been added to provide guidance on when finance charges imposed on credit accounts accessed by those account numbers would have satisfied the requirement for “open-end credit” that the creditor may impose a “finance charge” from time to time on an outstanding unpaid balance. For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) above, the final rule does not adopt the proposed changes to comment 2(a)(20)-4.ii related to these account numbers.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             Specifically, new comment 2(a)(20)-4.ii provides that with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61, any service, transaction, activity, or carrying charges imposed on the separate credit feature, and any such charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account to the extent that the amount of the charge exceeds comparable charges imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have a credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit, generally are finance charges, as described in existing § 1026.4(a) and new § 1026.4(b)(11). Such charges include a periodic fee to participate in the covered separate credit feature, regardless of whether this fee is imposed on the credit feature or on the asset feature of the prepaid account. With respect to credit from a covered separate credit feature, any service, transaction, activity, or carrying charges that are finance charges under final § 1026.4 constitute finance charges imposed from time to time on an outstanding unpaid balance, as described in existing § 1026.2(a)(20), if there is no specific amount financed for the credit feature for which the finance charge, total of payments, and payment schedule can be calculated.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not anticipate that there will be a specific amount financed for covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards. Instead, the Bureau anticipates that the credit lines on covered separate credit features generally will be replenishing. In such cases, an amount financed for the credit feature could not be calculated because the creditor will not know at the time the credit feature is established the amount of credit that will be extended. Thus, to the extent that any finance charge may be imposed on such a credit feature, the credit feature will meet this criterion.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that it is appropriate to consider covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards that are charge cards to meet this criterion of open-end credit. Under the Bureau's interpretation, a finance charge may be imposed time to time on an outstanding unpaid balance when any finance charge (including transaction fees or participation fees that are finance charges) may be imposed on the covered separate credit feature or asset feature of the prepaid account that are both accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card. In contrast, if the Bureau were to interpret narrowly the criterion of open-end credit that a finance charge may be imposed time to time on an outstanding unpaid balance and include only finance charges resulting from periodic rates, covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards that are charge card accounts instead would constitute closed-end credit. Under existing § 1026.2(a)(17)(iv), a card issuer offering such a charge card account would be a “creditor” for purposes of, and would need to comply with, the closed-end disclosure provisions in subpart C as well as certain open-end (not home-secured) disclosures rules in subpart B.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that receiving closed-end disclosures for these types of accounts would be confusing to consumers because the disclosures would be different from those disclosures received in connection with other open-end credit card accounts. Where the transactions otherwise would appear to be part of an open-end plan based on repeated transactions and replenishing credit, the Bureau believes that consumers would be better protected and better informed if such transactions were treated as open-end plans in the same way as their other credit card accounts. In addition, with respect to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card where that credit feature is a charge card account, the Bureau believes that complying with the closed-end credit rules would be difficult for card issuers (for example, at point of sale) because closed-end disclosures specific to each credit extension would need to be provided prior to each transaction. Thus, the Bureau is retaining the current interpretation in existing comment 2(a)(20)-4 that a finance charge is considered to be imposed from time to time on an outstanding unpaid balance, as described in existing § 1026.2(a)(20), if there is no specific amount financed for the credit feature for which the finance charge, total of payments, and payment schedule can be calculated. This means that most covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards will meet the definition of “open-end credit” if any finance charge may be imposed on the covered separate credit feature or asset feature of the prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also notes that persons that offer covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards where no finance charge may be imposed on the covered separate credit feature or asset feature of the prepaid account that are both accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card still would be subject to certain Regulation Z provisions. See the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(17) above.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>57(b) Public Disclosure of Agreements</title>
      <analysisParagraph>TILA section 140(f)(1) provides that an institution of higher education must publicly disclose any contract or other agreement made with a card issuer or creditor for the purpose of marketing a credit card.&lt;footnote ref="680"&gt;15 U.S.C. 1650(f)(1).&lt;/footnote&gt;
             This TILA provision is implemented by existing § 1026.57(b), which provides that an institution of higher education must publicly disclose any contract or other agreement made with a card issuer or creditor for the purpose of marketing a credit card.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed comment57(b)-3 to explain that existing § 1026.57(b) applies to any contract or other agreement that an institution of higher education makes with a card issuer or creditor for the purpose of marketing either (1) the addition of open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit accounts to prepaid accounts previously issued to full-time or part-time students, where that credit account would be accessed by a prepaid card that is a credit card; or (2) prepaid accounts where a credit account may be added in connection with the prepaid account and that credit account may be accessed by a prepaid card that is a credit card. Thus, under proposed § 1026.57(b), an institution of higher education would have been required to publicly disclose such agreements.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One consumer group commenter indicated that it is not enough to require an institution of higher education to offer a disclosure on marketing agreements with card issuers. This commenter believed that the Bureau should specifically require that these disclosures be made available on the institution's Web site. This commenter believed that these disclosures should be available on the same screen as the application for the card and would disclose the dollar amount received by the institution and any terms associated with those fees. The commenter believed that these terms should be listed in English and Spanish.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting proposed comment 57(b)-3 as proposed with technical revisions to clarify the intent of the comment and to be consistent with new § 1026.61.&lt;footnote ref="681"&gt;The proposal would have provided that the term “credit card” includes an account number that is not a prepaid card that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan that allows deposits directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. The proposal would have provided in comment 57(b)-3 that institutions of higher education must disclose marketing agreements related to credit card accounts accessed by these account numbers. For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) above, the final rule does not adopt the proposed changes to comment 57(b)-3 related to these account numbers.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             Under the final rule, new comment 57(b)-3 provides that existing § 1026.57(b) applies to any contract or other agreement that an institution of higher education makes with a card issuer or creditor for the purpose of marketing either (1) the addition of a covered separate credit feature that is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan to prepaid accounts as defined in § 1026.61 that were previously issued to full-time or part-time students; or (2) new prepaid accounts where a covered separate credit feature that is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan may in the future be added to the prepaid account. Thus, under § 1026.57(b), an institution of higher education must publicly disclose such agreements.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 and a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its adjustment authority under TILA section 105(a) to effectuate the purposes of TILA by applying section 140(f)'s requirements for college card agreements to prepaid cards where covered separate credit features that are credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards may subsequently be added. The provisions in TILA section 140(f) addressing college card agreements reflect Congress's particular concern with providing special protections for students to ensure that students can make informed credit decisions, and the Bureau believes that including such cards is consistent with such congressional concerns for college students and credit card debt. The Bureau believes that the marketing efforts related to a prepaid account, including the inducements given by a card issuer to open a prepaid account, may have an impact on whether consumers may request that a covered separate credit feature that is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit card be linked to the prepaid account, as discussed above, when such covered separate credit features are offered to them. Thus, the Bureau believes that the marketing related to a prepaid account where a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card may be added would constitute marketing of a credit card. Thus, under the final rule, an institution of higher education must publicly disclose agreements for the marketing of prepaid accounts where a covered separate credit feature that is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card may be added in connection with the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, one consumer group commenter indicated that it is not enough to require an institution of higher education to offer a disclosure related to marketing agreements with card issuers.

The commenter believed that these terms should be listed in English and Spanish.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The final rule does not impose additional requirements on institutions of higher education to disclose marketing agreements. The Bureau believes such changes are outside the scope of the proposal and does not make the change at this time. The Bureau notes that existing comment1026.57(b)-1 provides that institutions of higher education may comply with the requirement in existing § 1026.57(b) by publishing any relevant credit card agreement on their Web site or by making such agreements available free of charge upon request using reasonable procedures and in a reasonable timeframe. In addition, the Bureau sent a warning letter in December 2015 to several institutions of higher education because their agreements were not posted on their Web sites and could not be publicly obtained by the Bureau using reasonable procedures and in a reasonable timeframe.&lt;footnote ref="682"&gt;&amp;lt;em data-original="E-03"&amp;gt;See&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; Press Release, CFPB, &amp;lt;em data-original="E-03"&amp;gt;CFPB Warns Colleges About Secret Campus Credit Card Contracts&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; (Dec. 16, 2015), &amp;lt;em data-original="E-03"&amp;gt;available at&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;

             In the letter, the Bureau noted that publishing the agreement on the Web site is proving to be the least burdensome and most straightforward means of complying with § 1026.57(b), and that any other approach may be less effective and creates compliance risk.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail below, the final rule adds new comment 52(b)-3 to provide guidance on how the restrictions in final § 1026.52(b) generally apply to fees or charges imposed in connection with covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, as defined in new § 1026.61, where the credit feature is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan. The final rule also adds new comment 52(b)-4 to provide that the restrictions in final § 1026.52(b) do not apply to fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account with respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards when the fees or charges are not “charges imposed as part of the plan” under new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D) with respect to the covered separate credit feature. Comment 52(b)-4 also provides that the restrictions in final § 1026.52(b) do not apply to fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account with respect to non-covered separate credit features.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In addition, in the proposal, the Bureau solicited comment on issues related to fees imposed by card issuers when preauthorized payments are returned unpaid. Specifically, the Bureau solicited comment on situations where at the time a preauthorized payment is set to occur, the prepaid account does not have sufficient funds to cover the amount of the credit card payment. The Bureau solicited comment on: (1) How credit card issuers anticipate handling this situation, including cases where the prepaid account contains funds sufficient to pay some but not all of the credit card payment due; (2) whether issuers anticipate charging a specific fee because the preauthorized payment could not be completed, in addition to any late fee that might be charged if the credit card balance were not paid by the due date; and (3) whether the Bureau should adopt any specific rules to address these issues, and if so, what rules should the Bureau adopt.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The proposal included this request for comment in the discussion of the offset prohibition in proposed § 1026.12(d). With respect to credit card accounts accessed by prepaid cards that would have been credit cards under the proposal, proposed § 1026.12(d)(3) would have allowed an exception for certain preauthorized payment plans to the offset prohibition in proposed § 1026.12(d)(1). In response to this request for comment, several consumer group commenters indicated that the Bureau should adopt additional restrictions in § 1026.52(b) related to the circumstances in which card issuers can charge fees when preauthorized payments are returned unpaid and/or related to the amount of the fees. As discussed in more detail below, one consumer group commenter indicated that the Bureau should prohibit these fees under § 1026.52(b). Several consumer group commenters indicated that the Bureau should adopt additional restrictions in § 1026.52(b) limiting the circumstances in which these fees can be charged and limiting the amount of the fees.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.12(d)(3) above, respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, as defined in new § 1026.61, final § 1026.12(d)(3) sets forth an exception for certain preauthorized payment plans with respect to the offset prohibition in final § 1026.12(d). As discussed in more detail below, the restrictions in existing § 1026.52(b) related to returned payment fees apply to fees that are imposed by card issuers when preauthorized payments are returned unpaid. The Bureau does not believe that additional restrictions are needed at this time under final § 1026.52(b) with respect to the circumstances in which these fees can be charged or the amount of the fees in connection with covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>General Guidance</title>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards.&lt;/em&gt; As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 and a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New § 1026.61(b) generally requires that such credit features be structured as separate subaccounts or accounts, distinct from the prepaid asset account, to facilitate transparency and compliance with various Regulation Z requirements. To reflect this change and to ensure compliance with the restrictions in § 1026.52(b), new comment 52(b)-3 provides that with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61 where the credit feature is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, final § 1026.52(b) applies to any fee for violating the terms or other requirements of the credit feature, regardless of whether those fees are imposed on the credit feature or on the asset feature of the prepaid account. For example, assume that a late fee will be imposed by the card issuer if the separate credit feature becomes delinquent or if a payment is not received by a particular date. This fee is subject to final § 1026.52(b) regardless of whether the fee is imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account or on the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that the restriction on penalty fees set forth in TILA section 149(a), and implemented in existing § 1026.52(b), provides important protections for consumers, particularly in the context of covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards. Covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards are designed to provide liquidity to the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As described above, new comment 52(b)-3 provides that with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, as defined in § 1026.61 where the credit feature is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, § 1026.52(b) applies to any fee for violating the terms or other requirements of the credit feature, regardless of whether those fees are imposed on the credit feature or on the asset feature of the prepaid account. TILA section 149(a) applies to any penalty fee or charge that a card issuer may impose with respect to a credit card account under an open-end consumer credit plan. Those terms readily encompass credit-related fees that are imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account. Even if the terms were ambiguous, the Bureau believes—based on its expertise and experience with respect to credit markets—that interpreting them to encompass credit-related fees imposed on the asset feature would promote the purposes of TILA to protect the consumer against inaccurate and unfair credit billing and credit card practices. From the consumer's perspective, there is no practical difference when a penalty fee for a violation of the covered separate credit feature is charged against the covered separate credit feature and when it is charged to the asset feature of the prepaid account. If TILA section 149(a) were not interpreted to include penalty fees for violations of the covered separate credit feature charged to the asset feature, the Bureau is concerned that card issuers could avoid the restrictions set forth in TILA section 149(a) and final § 1026.52(b) with respect to these fees simply by imposing them on the asset feature of the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, to facilitate compliance with final § 1026.52(b), new comment 52(b)-4 provides that final § 1026.52(b) does not apply to any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account that is not a charge imposed as part of the plan under new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D) with respect to a covered separate credit feature. As discussed above, the Bureau believes this additional guidance is needed given the changes in the final rule to the definition of “finance charge” in final § 1026.4, the definition of “charges imposed as part of the plan” in final § 1026.6(b)(3), and the addition of new § 1026.61.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.6 above, with respect to a fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, a fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account is a “charge imposed as part of the plan” under final § 1026.6(b)(3) to the extent that the amount of the fee or charges exceeds comparable fees or charges imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have a credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. This fee or charge also is a finance charge under new § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Nonetheless, under new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D) and new comment 6(b)(3)(iii)(D)-1, with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, as defined in new § 1026.61, a fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account is not a “charge imposed as part of the plan” with respect to the covered separate credit feature to the extent that the amount of the fee or charges does not exceed comparable fees or charges imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have a credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. As described in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) above, these fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are not finance charges under new § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analyses of §§ 1026.4 and 1026.6 above, the Bureau believes that fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account that are not finance charges (and thus, not charges imposed as part of the plan under new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D)) with respect to the covered separate credit feature are more appropriately regulated under Regulation E, rather than regulated under Regulation Z, with respect to the covered separate credit feature. Thus, new comment 52(b)-4 provides that final § 1026.52(b) does not apply to any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account that is not a charge imposed as part of the plan under new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Non-covered separate credit features.&lt;/em&gt; As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a “non-covered separate credit feature,” which means that the separate credit feature either (1) cannot be accessed in the course of a prepaid card transaction to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; or (2) is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. As described in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii), a non-covered separate credit feature is not subject to the rules applicable to hybrid prepaid-credit cards; however, it typically will be subject to Regulation Z depending on its own terms and conditions, independent of the connection to the prepaid account. Thus, a non-covered separate credit feature may be subject to the provisions in § 1026.52(b) in its own right.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to non-covered separate credit features that are subject to final § 1026.52(b), new comment 52(b)-4 also provides that final § 1026.52(b) does not apply to any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account that is not a charge imposed as part of the plan under new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(E) with respect to a non-covered separate credit feature. Under new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(E) and new comment 6(b)(3)(iii)(E)-1, with respect to a non-covered separate credit feature as defined in new § 1026.61, none of the fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are “charges imposed as part of the plan” under final § 1026.6(b)(3) with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature. New comment 6(b)(3)(iii)(E)-1 also cross-references new comment 4(b)(11)-1.ii.B, which provides that none of the fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are finance charges under final § 1026.4 with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature. Thus, final § 1026.52(b) does not apply to fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analyses of §§ 1026.4 and 1026.6 above, the Bureau believes that fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account are more appropriately regulated under Regulation E, rather than regulated under Regulation Z, with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Fees for Preauthorized Payments That Are Returned Unpaid</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, in the proposal, the Bureau solicited comment on situations where at the time a preauthorized payment is set to occur, the prepaid account does not have sufficient funds to cover the amount of the credit card payment. The Bureau solicited comment on: (1) How credit card issuers anticipate handling this situation, including cases where the prepaid account contains funds sufficient to pay some, but not all, of the credit card payment due; (2) whether issuers anticipate charging a specific fee because the preauthorized payment could not be completed, in addition to any late fee that might be charged if the credit card balance was not paid by the due date; and (3) whether the Bureau should adopt any specific rules to address these issues, and if so, what rules should the Bureau adopt.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The proposal included this request for comment in the discussion of the offset prohibition in proposed § 1026.12(d). With respect to credit card accounts accessed by prepaid cards that would have been credit cards under the proposal, proposed § 1026.12(d)(3) would have allowed an exception for certain preauthorized payment plans to the offset prohibition in proposed § 1026.12(d)(1). In response to this request for comment, several consumer group commenters indicated that the Bureau should adopt additional restrictions in § 1026.52(b) related to the circumstances in which card issuers can charge fees when preauthorized payments are returned unpaid and/or related to the amount of the fees. One consumer group commenter indicated that the Bureau should adopt rules to cover the situation where the consumer authorizes periodic deductions, but there is not enough money to cover a payment when due. In particular, this commenter indicated the Bureau should prohibit fees that are imposed by card issuers when preauthorized payments are returned unpaid under existing § 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;) as a “declined transaction fee.” Existing § 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B) provides that a card issuer must not impose a fee for violating the terms or other requirements of a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan when there is no dollar amount associated with the violation. Existing § 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;) provides that there is no dollar amount associated with transactions that the card issuer declines to authorize, and thus fees charged for those declined transactions are prohibited under existing § 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In the alternative, this commenter indicated that the Bureau should use its authority to establish “additional requirements” to provide for a “right to cure” period for the limited circumstance of prepaid consumers who have authorized automatic deductions to repay credit associated with their prepaid card. This commenter indicated that the Bureau should require the card issuer to provide a limited time period, such as one week, to add funds to the prepaid account before a penalty fee under § 1026.52(b) could be imposed. In that case, any penalty fees would be subject to the limitations of existing § 1026.52(b), namely, that the fee amount (1) must be consistent with either the cost analysis in existing § 1026.52(b)(1)(i) or the safe harbors in existing § 1026.52(b)(1)(ii); and (2) does not exceed the dollar amount associated with the violation under existing § 1026.52(b)(2)(i). In addition, under existing § 1026.52(b)(2)(ii), a card issuer could not impose more than one fee for violating the terms or other requirements of a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan based on a single event or transaction.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Another consumer group commenter indicated that if the prepaid account does not have enough funds to satisfy a requested transfer or a preauthorized payment, the Bureau should provide some kind of cushion where consumers could avoid a fee if the debt obligation falls below a certain threshold— &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;i.e.,&lt;/em&gt; less than $20 and that no fee should be greater than the minimum 4 percent repayment amount and/or the overdraft service charge.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.12(d)(3) above, with respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, as defined in § 1026.61, final § 1026.12(d)(3) sets forth an exception for certain preauthorized payment plans with respect to the offset prohibition in final § 1026.12(d). The Bureau does not believe that fees imposed by card issuers when preauthorized payments are returned unpaid are fees for declined transactions under § 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;). The Bureau believes that it is clear under existing comment 52(b)-1.i.B that fees imposed by card issuers when preauthorized payments are returned unpaid constitute fees for returned payments and are regulated as returned payment fees under § 1026.52(b)(1), (2)(i)(A), and (2)(ii). Specifically, existing comment 52(b)(1)-i.B provides that the limitations in § 1026.52(b) apply to returned payment fees and any other fees imposed by a card issuer if a payment initiated via check, ACH, or other payment method is returned. Existing commentary to § 1026.52(b)(1), (2)(i)(A), and (2)(ii) provide guidance on how the restrictions in existing § 1026.52(b)(1), (2)(i)(A) and (2)(ii) apply to returned payment fees. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; comments 52(b)(1)(i)-7, 52(b)(1)(ii)-1.i.B, 52(b)(1)(ii)-1.iii.C, 52(b)(2)(i)-2, and 52(b)(2)(ii)-1.ii, iii and v through vii. For example, § 1026.52(b)(1), and (b)(2)(i)(A) and related commentary restrict the amount of the fee that a card issuer can impose for a returned payment. In addition, if a payment has been returned and is submitted again for payment by the card issuer, comment 52(b)(2)(i)-2 provides that there is no additional dollar amount associated with a subsequent return of that payment and a card issuer is prohibited from imposing an additional returned payment fee. Also, comment 52(b)(2)(ii)-1.ii.A and B provide that a card issuer is prohibited from assessing both a late payment fee and a returned payment fee based on a single event or transaction. The existing restrictions in § 1026.52(b)(1), (2)(i)(A), and (2)(ii), and related commentary regarding returned payment fees apply to fees imposed by card issuers when preauthorized payments are returned unpaid in connection with covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, as defined in § 1026.61, that are subject to § 1026.52(b).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has not established additional requirements beyond those contained in § 1026.52(b)(1), (2)(i)(A), and (2)(ii) and related commentary regarding returned payment fees in connection with covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, such as a right to cure period for prepaid consumers where preauthorized payments have been returned unpaid. At this time, the Bureau believes that the fee restrictions that apply generally to credit card accounts in existing § 1026.52(b)(1), (2)(i)(A), and (2)(ii) and related commentary with respect to returned payments are sufficient to protect consumers with respect to the circumstances in which card issuer can impose fees for preauthorized payments that are returned unpaid in connection with covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards. The Bureau will continue to monitor whether additional safeguards are needed.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analyses of § 1026.4(a) and (b)(2) above, the Bureau proposed § 1026.4(b)(2) and comments 4(a)-4.iii and 4(b)(2)-1.ii through iv to provide guidance regarding when a fee imposed in relation to credit accessed by a prepaid card would have been a finance charge under § 1026.4.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 4(a)-4.iii would have set forth guidance on when transaction fees imposed on credit card accounts accessed by prepaid cards would have been considered finance charges under the proposal. Specifically, this comment would have provided that any transaction charge imposed on a cardholder by a card issuer for credit accessed by a prepaid card is a finance charge regardless of whether the card issuer imposes the same, greater, or lesser charge on the withdrawal of funds from a prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1026.4(b)(2)(ii) and proposed comment 4(b)(2)-1.ii through iv would have provided guidance on when service, transaction, activity, and carrying charges imposed on a prepaid account in connection with credit accessed by a prepaid card would have been a finance charge under the proposal. Specifically, proposed § 1026.4(b)(2)(ii) would have provided that any charge imposed on the prepaid account in connection with an extension of credit, for carrying a credit balance, or for credit availability would have been a finance charge where that fee is imposed on a prepaid account in connection with credit accessed by a prepaid card, regardless of whether the creditor imposes the same, greater, or lesser charge on the withdrawal of funds from the prepaid account, to have access to the prepaid account, or when credit is not extended.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Under proposed comment 4(b)(2)-1.ii, transaction fees imposed on a prepaid account for credit extensions would have been finance charges, regardless of whether the creditor imposes the same, greater, or lesser per transaction fee to withdraw funds from the prepaid account. To illustrate, assume a $1.50 transaction charge is imposed on the prepaid account for each transaction that is made with the prepaid card, including when the prepaid card is used to access credit where the consumer has insufficient or unavailable funds in the prepaid account at the time of authorization or at the time the transaction is paid. Under the proposal, the $1.50 transaction charge would have been a finance charge when the prepaid card accesses credit, notwithstanding that a $1.50 transaction charge also is imposed on transactions that solely access funds in the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, under proposed comment 4(b)(2)-1.ii, a fee imposed on the prepaid account for the availability of an open-end plan that is accessed by a prepaid card would have been a finance charge regardless of whether the creditor imposes the same, greater, or lesser monthly service charge to hold the prepaid account. For example, assume a creditor imposes $5 monthly service charge on the prepaid account for the availability of an open-end plan that is accessed by a prepaid card. Under the proposal, the $5 monthly service charge would have been a finance charge regardless of whether the creditor imposes the same, greater, or lesser monthly service charge to hold the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In the proposal, the Bureau recognized that if a prepaid account issuer imposes a per transaction fee on a prepaid account for any transactions authorized or settled on the prepaid account, the prepaid account issuer would need to waive that per transaction fee imposed on the prepaid account when the transaction accesses credit to take advantage of the exception for when a prepaid card would not be a credit card under the proposal.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 4(b)(2)-1.iii would have provided that examples of charges imposed on a prepaid account in connection with an extension of credit, for carrying a credit balance, or for credit availability include (1) transaction fees for credit extensions; (2) fees for transferring funds from a credit account to a prepaid account; (3) a daily, weekly, or monthly (or other periodic) fee assessed each period a prepaid account is in “overdraft” status, or would be in overdraft status but for funds supplied by a linked line of credit; (4) a daily, weekly, or monthly (or other periodic) fee assessed each period a line of credit accessed by a prepaid card has an outstanding balance; and (5) participation fees or other fees that the consumer is required to pay for the issuance or availability of credit.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 4(b)(2)-1.iv would have provided that proposed § 1026.4(b)(2)(ii) would not apply to: (1) Transaction fees imposed on the prepaid account that are imposed only on transactions that solely access funds in the prepaid account (and are not imposed on transactions that either are funded in whole or in part from credit); (2) fees for opening or holding the prepaid account; and (3) other fees, such as cash reload fees and balance inquiry fees, that are not imposed on the prepaid account because the consumer engaged in a transaction that is funded in whole or in part by credit, for holding a credit plan, or for carrying a credit balance. These fees would not have been considered charges imposed on a prepaid account in connection with an extension of credit, for carrying a credit balance, or for credit availability even if there were not sufficient funds in the prepaid account to pay the fees at the time they were imposed on the prepaid account. Nonetheless, under the proposal, any negative balance on the prepaid account, whether from fees or other transactions, would have been a credit extension, and if a fee were imposed for such credit extension, the fee would have been a finance charge under proposed § 1026.4(b)(2)(ii). For example, if a cash-reload fee were imposed on the prepaid account and an additional charge were imposed on the prepaid account for a credit extension because there were not sufficient funds in the prepaid account to pay the cash reload fee when it was imposed on the prepaid account, the additional charge would have been a transaction charge imposed on a prepaid account in connection with an extension of credit and would have been a finance charge under proposed § 1026.4(b)(2)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received substantial comment on the circumstances in which fees imposed in connection with credit accessed by a prepaid card should be considered finance charges under § 1026.4. As discussed below, in response to comments received, the Bureau is revising substantially from the proposal the circumstances in which a fee or charge imposed with respect to credit extended in connection with a prepaid account is a finance charge under § 1026.4.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters raised concerns regarding the breadth of fees that would be considered finance charges under the proposal. Many industry commenters were concerned that even though they did not intend to offer credit in connection with the prepaid account, credit could result in certain circumstances, such as forced pay-transactions as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61 below. Because this credit could be extended, many commenters were concerned that fees that generally applied to the prepaid account, but were not specific to the overdraft credit, could be finance charges under the proposal and thus would subject the prepaid account issuer to the credit card rules under Regulation Z. These commenters were concerned that they could not charge certain fees on the prepaid account, or would have to waive certain fees, for the prepaid card not to be considered to be a credit card under the proposal. In particular, proposed comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.F would have provided that the term “credit card” includes a prepaid card (including a prepaid card that is solely an account number) that is a single device that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan, except for when the prepaid card only accesses credit that is not subject to any finance charge, as defined in § 1026.4, or any fee described in § 1026.4(c), and is not payable by written agreement in more than four installments. Under the proposal, for a prepaid card not to be a credit card when it accesses a credit plan, the credit accessed by the prepaid card could not be subject to any finance charge, as defined in § 1026.4, or any fee described in § 1026.4(c), and any credit accessed could not be payable by written agreement in more than four installments.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters indicated that certain fees should not be considered finance charges in connection with credit accessed by a prepaid card, and thus, a prepaid account issuer could continue to charge these fees on the prepaid account without the prepaid card becoming a credit card under the proposal.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For example, several commenters, including an industry trade association, an issuing bank, a program manager, and a digital wallet provider, indicated that consistent with existing § 1026.4(b)(2), a fee that is imposed on a prepaid account in both credit and cash transactions should not be a finance charge when the fee is imposed on a prepaid account. They argued that these fees are exempt from the definition of finance charge under the “comparable cash transaction” exception. Existing § 1026.4(b)(2) provides that examples of finance charges generally include service, transaction, activity, and carrying charges. However, existing § 1026.4(b)(2) contains a partial exception to this example stating that for any charge imposed on a checking or other transaction account, such a service or transaction account charge, is only a finance charge to the extent that the charge exceeds the charge for a similar account without a credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, several commenters, including an industry trade association, an issuing bank, a program manager, and a digital wallet provider, indicated that the term “finance charge” should not include per transaction fees charged on a prepaid account for an extension of credit that are the same amount as the fee that would be charged for transactions paid entirely with funds available in the prepaid account. These industry commenters were concerned that a prepaid account issuer would need to waive per transaction fees charged for credit extensions even if they were the same amount as the fee charged for transactions it paid entirely with funds available in the prepaid account to avoid charging a finance charge under the proposal. As discussed above, under the proposal, all per transaction fees for credit transactions were finance charges. Thus, under the proposal, a prepaid account issuer would need to waive per transaction fees imposed on the prepaid account for credit transactions for the prepaid card not to be a credit card under the proposal.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Two industry trade associations indicated that the term “finance charge” should only include fees or charges arising from the fact that the transaction is an overdraft and specifically exclude other fees or charges that are wholly unrelated to the fact that the transaction is an overdraft, such as a fee for a balance inquiry at an ATM. These two commenters argued that such unrelated fees or charges should not be “finance charges” even if they are imposed when the prepaid account balance is negative. Another industry trade association indicated that a monthly fee to hold the prepaid account should not be a “finance charge” simply because it may be imposed when the balance on the prepaid account is negative or because negative balances can occur on the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several consumer groups commented on this aspect of the proposal. One consumer group commenter indicated that per transaction fees for credit extensions imposed on prepaid accounts should be finance charges even if they are the same amount as the fee charged for transactions paid entirely with funds available in the prepaid account. This consumer group commenter indicated that if a prepaid account issuer wanted to avoid charging a finance charge on the prepaid account, the cleanest solution is the one the Bureau proposed: Simply waive the fee. Another consumer group commenter indicated that any fee or charge that occurs when credit is accessed should be considered a finance charge.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is amending existing § 1026.4 and its commentary to provide additional clarification and guidance as to what types of fees and charges constitute “finance charges” related to credit offered in connection with a prepaid account. First, the Bureau provides guidance on the definition of finance charge in relation to covered separate credit features accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit cards. Second, the Bureau also provides guidance on the definition of finance charge in relation to credit features accessible by prepaid cards that are not hybrid prepaid-credit cards. Starting with the first category, as described above, the Bureau generally intends the final rule to regulate prepaid cards as credit cards when they can access overdraft credit features offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliates, or its business partners (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). Such credit features are generally required under new § 1026.61(b) to be structured as a separate subaccount or account, distinct from the prepaid asset account, to facilitate transparency and compliance with Regulation Z. To effectuate this decision and provide compliance guidance to industry, new § 1026.4(b)(11) and its related commentary specify rules for distinguishing when particular types of fees or charges that are imposed on the covered separate credit feature or on the asset feature on a prepaid account, which are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, are finance charges under Regulation Z. Specifically, new § 1026.4(b)(11) provides that the following fees generally are finance charges with respect to such covered separate credit features and asset features: (1) Any fee or charge, such as interest rates and service, transaction, activity, or carrying charges, imposed on the covered separate credit feature, regardless of whether the credit feature is structured as a credit subaccount of the prepaid account or a separate credit account; and (2) any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account to the extent that the amount of the fee or charge exceeds comparable fees or charges imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. These provisions are discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analyses of § 1026.4(b)(11)(i) and (ii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The commentary to new § 1026.4(b)(11) also provides guidance regarding credit features that are accessible by prepaid cards that are not credit cards under the final rule. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61 below, the Bureau also has decided to exclude prepaid cards from being covered as credit cards under Regulation Z when they access certain specified types of credit. First, under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii), a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a “non-covered separate credit feature,” which means that the separate credit feature either (1) cannot be accessed in the course of a prepaid card transaction to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; or (2) is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. Second, under new § 1026.61(a)(4), a prepaid card also is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card when the prepaid card accesses incidental credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account where the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit. A prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 or a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) when it accesses credit from these types of credit features. For more detailed explanations of when prepaid cards are not credit cards under Regulation Z, see the section-by-section analyses of § 1026.61(a)(2) and (4) below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 4(b)(11)-1.i provides that the rules for classification of fees or charges as finance charges in connection with a covered separate credit feature and the asset feature of the prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card are specified in § 1026.4(b)(11) and related commentary. This guidance is discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analyses of § 1026.4(b)(11)(i) and (ii). As discussed in more detail below, new comment 4(b)(11)-1.ii and iii sets forth guidance on when fee or charges are finance charges under § 1026.4 when these fees or charges are imposed in connection with credit features that are accessible by prepaid cards that are not credit cards.&lt;footnote ref="618"&gt;One industry commenter noted the proposed definition of “finance charge” in connection with prepaid accounts and raised questions about the impact these proposed changes would have in terms of obligations to notify consumers of adverse actions under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B. The Bureau believes that it has addressed these concerns in the final rule by providing additional guidance on the type of fees that are “finance charges” with respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards. In addition, the final rule also excludes prepaid cards from being covered as credit cards under Regulation Z when they access non-covered separate credit features as defined in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii), or access incidental credit as a negative balance on the prepaid account as set forth in new § 1026.61(a)(4).&lt;/footnote&gt;
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Non-covered separate credit features.&lt;/em&gt; With respect to separate credit features, as noted above, under § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii), there are two circumstances in which new § 1026.61 provides that a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card when it accesses a separate credit feature. The first is where the prepaid card cannot be used to access credit from the separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. The second is where the separate credit feature is offered by an unrelated third party, rather than the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii) defines a separate credit feature that does not meet these two conditions as a “non-covered separate credit feature.” As described in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii), a non-covered separate credit feature is not subject to the rules applicable to hybrid prepaid-credit cards; however, it typically will be subject to Regulation Z in its own right, depending on the terms and conditions of the product.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 4(b)(11)-1.ii provides that new § 1026.4(b)(11) and related commentary do not apply to fees or charges imposed on the non-covered separate credit feature; instead, the general rules set forth in existing § 1026.4 determine whether these fees or charges are finance charges. In addition, fees or charges on the asset feature of the prepaid account are not finance charges under final § 1026.4 with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Overdraft credit features excepted under § 1026.61(a)(4).&lt;/em&gt; As described in new § 1026.61(a)(4), a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card (and is not a credit card under Regulation Z) where the prepaid card accesses incidental credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account where the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit. Specifically, under this exception, the prepaid account issuer (1) must have a general policy and practice of declining to authorize transactions made with the card where there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account at the time the transaction is authorized to cover the amount of the transactions or to only authorize such negative balance transactions in circumstances related to payment cushions and delayed load cushions; and (2) must not charge any credit-related fees as defined in new § 1026.61(a)(4) for any credit extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account, except for fees or charges for the actual costs of collecting the credit extended if otherwise permitted by law. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(4) below, such credit features will not trigger coverage of the credit card rules.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to what “credit-related fees” will cause such a credit feature to fall outside the scope of the new § 1026.61(a)(4) exclusion, new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B) provides that with respect to prepaid accounts that are accessible by the prepaid card, the prepaid account issuer may not charge the following fees or charges on the asset feature of the prepaid account: (1) Any fees or charges for opening, issuing, or holding a negative balance on the asset feature, or for the availability of credit, whether imposed on a one-time or periodic basis. This would not include fees or charges to open, issue, or hold the prepaid account where the amount of the fee or charge imposed on the asset feature is not higher based on whether credit might be offered or has been accepted, whether or how much credit the consumer has accessed, or the amount of credit available; (2) any fees or charges that will be imposed only when credit is extended on the asset feature or when there is a negative balance on the asset feature, except that a prepaid account issuer may impose fees or charges for the actual costs of collecting the credit extended if otherwise permitted by law; or (3) any fees or charges where the amount of the fee or charge is higher when credit is extended on the asset feature or when there is a negative balance on the asset feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>This language in new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B) allows a prepaid account issuer to qualify for the exception in new § 1026.61(a)(4) even if it charges transaction fees on the asset feature of the prepaid account for overdrafts so long as the amount of the per transaction fee does not exceed the amount of the per transaction fee imposed for transactions conducted entirely with funds available in the asset feature of a prepaid account. New § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(C) also makes clear that a prepaid account issuer may still satisfy the exception in new § 1026.61(a)(4) even if it debits fees or charges from the asset feature when there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature to cover those fees or charges at the time they are imposed, so long as those fees or charges are not the type of fees or charges enumerated in new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B) as discussed above.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Thus, in order to qualify for the exception in new § 1026.61(a)(4), a prepaid account issuer generally may not charge additional fees or higher fees when credit is extended on the asset feature of the prepaid account or there is a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account, except for fees or charges for the actual costs of collecting the credit extended if otherwise permitted by law. Provided it meets this limitation and the other requirements of new § 1026.61(a)(4), the prepaid account issuer will not be a “card issuer” under final § 1026.2(a)(7) and thus the credit card rules in Regulation Z do not apply to such a credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, new comment 4(b)(11)-1.iii provides that fees charged on the asset feature of the prepaid account in accordance with new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B) are not finance charges. This ensures that a prepaid account issuer is not a “creditor” under the general definition of “creditor” set forth in existing § 1026.2(a)(17)(i) as a result of charging these fees on the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that many of the concerns raised by industry commenters as discussed above with respect to the definition of “finance charge” have been addressed by creating new § 1026.61(a)(4) and its treatment of credit-related charges in new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B) and new comment 4(b)(11)-1.iii. As discussed above, many industry commenters were concerned that even though they did not intend to offer credit in connection with the prepaid account, credit could result in certain circumstances, such as force pay transactions as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61 below. Because this credit could be extended, many commenters were concerned that fees that generally applied to the prepaid account, but were not specific to the overdraft credit, could be finance charges under the proposal and thus would subject the prepaid account issuer to the credit card rules under Regulation Z. Because of these concerns, many industry commenters urged that that the Bureau not consider certain fees to be finance charges, and thus, a prepaid account issuer could continue to charge these fees on the prepaid account without making the prepaid card also a credit card under the proposal.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For example, several commenters, including an industry trade association, an issuing bank, a program manager, and a digital wallet provider, indicated that the term “finance charge” should not include per transaction fees charged on a prepaid account for an extension of credit that are the same amount as the fee that would be charged for transactions paid entirely with funds available in the prepaid account. These industry commenters also were concerned that if they generally charged the same per transaction fee for all transactions paid using a prepaid account, regardless of whether the transaction is paid entirely with funds available in the prepaid account or is paid in whole or in part with credit, a prepaid account issuer would need to waive those per transaction fees for transactions resulting in an overdraft for a prepaid card not to be a credit card under the proposal. Also, two industry trade associations indicated that the term “finance charge” should only include fees or charges arising from the fact that the transaction is an overdraft and specifically exclude other fees or charges that are wholly unrelated to the fact that the transaction is an overdraft, such as a fee for a balance inquiry at an ATM. These two commenters argued that such unrelated fees or charges should not be “finance charges” even if they are imposed when the prepaid account balance is negative. Another industry trade association indicated that a monthly fee to hold the prepaid account should not be a “finance charge” simply because it may be imposed when the balance on the prepaid account is negative or because negative balances can occur on the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The final rule addresses these concerns in a number of ways, so long as the types of credit provided are limited to the narrow types addressed in new § 1026.61(a)(4). First, new § 1026.61(a)(4) does not require a prepaid account issuer to waive per transaction fees imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account if the amount of the per transaction fee imposed for transactions involving credit is not higher than the amount of the fee that is imposed for transactions that only access funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account. Second, under the exception in new § 1026.61(a)(4), the final rule provides that if a fee is not a fee enumerated in new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B), the prepaid account issuer may still debit these fees or charges from the asset feature when there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature to cover those fees or charges at the time they are imposed. Third, the final rule clarifies that under this exception, a prepaid account issuer may charge a fee to hold the prepaid account, so long as the amount of the fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account is not higher based on whether credit might be offered or has been accepted, whether or how much credit the consumer has accessed, or the amount of credit available.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, as discussed above, new comment 4(b)(11)-1.iii provides that fees charged on the asset feature of the prepaid account in accordance with new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B) are not finance charges. This ensures that a prepaid account issuer is not a “creditor” under the general definition of “creditor” set forth in existing § 1026.2(a)(17)(i) as a result of charging these fees on the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>2(a)(15)(ii) Credit Card Account Under an Open-End (not Home-Secured) Consumer Credit Plan</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Regulation Z defines the term “credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan” in existing § 1026.2(a)(15)(ii) to mean “any open-end credit account that is accessed by a credit card, except: (A) [a] home-equity plan subject to the requirements of § 1026.40 that is accessed by a credit card; or (B) [a]n overdraft line of credit that is accessed by a debit card or an account number.” As discussed above, certain requirements in the Credit CARD Act, which are generally set forth in subpart G, apply to card issuers offering a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; existing §§ 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A), 1026.7(b)(11), and 1026.51 to 1026.59.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The proposal would have clarified that the exception in current § 1026.2(a)(15)(ii)(B) regarding overdraft lines of credit accessed by a debit card or account number would not have applied to open-end credit plans accessed by prepaid cards that would have been credit cards under the proposal. The proposed definition of “debit card” in proposed § 1026.15(a)(2)(iv) would have excluded a prepaid card.&lt;footnote ref="602"&gt;Proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(iv) would have defined the term “debit card” for purposes of Regulation Z to mean “any card, plate, or other single device that may be used from time to time to access an asset account other than a prepaid account.” The proposed definition of “debit card” also would have specified that it does not include a prepaid card.&lt;/footnote&gt;

             Thus, the exception in existing § 1026.2(a)(15)(ii)(B) would not have applied to overdraft lines of credit that are accessed by a prepaid card. In addition, the proposal would have revised existing § 1026.2(a)(15)(ii)(B) to only include the exception for overdraft lines of credit accessed by a debit card. The proposal also would have moved the exception for overdraft lines of credit that are accessed by account numbers from existing § 1026.2(a)(15)(ii)(B) to proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(ii)(C). The proposal also would have amended proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(ii)(C) and existing comment 2(a)(15)-4 to provide that the exception would not have applied to an overdraft line of credit that is accessed by an account number where the account number is a prepaid card that is a credit card.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive specific comments on the proposed changes to existing § 1026.2(a)(15)(ii) and related commentary. The Bureau is revising existing § 1026.2(a)(15)(ii) and existing comment 2(a)(15)-4 as proposed with revisions consistent with § 1026.61.&lt;footnote ref="603"&gt;The proposal would have provided that the term “credit card” includes an account number that is not a prepaid card that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan that allows deposits directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. Thus, under proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(ii)(C) and proposed comment 2(a)(15)-4, the exception in proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(ii)(C) would not have applied to credit plans that would have been accessed by such account numbers. For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) above, the final rule does not adopt the proposed changes to § 1026.2(a)(15)(ii)(C) and comment 2(a)(15)-4 related to these account numbers.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             Consistent with the proposal, the Bureau is revising existing § 1026.2(a)(15)(ii)(B) to only include the exception for overdraft lines of credit accessed by a debit card. Consistent with the proposal, the Bureau is defining “debit card” in new § 1026.2(a)(15)(iv) to exclude a prepaid card.&lt;footnote ref="604"&gt;Consistent with the proposal, new § 1026.2(a)(15)(iv) defines the term “debit card” for purposes of Regulation Z to mean “any card, plate, or other single device that may be used from time to time to access an asset account other than a prepaid account as defined in § 1026.61.” The definition of “debit card” specifies that it does not include a prepaid card as defined in § 1026.61.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             Thus, under the final rule, the exception in final § 1026.2(a)(15)(ii)(B) does not apply to overdraft lines of credit that are accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as that term is defined in new § 1026.61. In addition, consistent with the proposal, the Bureau is moving the exception for overdraft lines of credit that are accessed by account numbers from existing § 1026.2(a)(15)(ii)(B) to new § 1026.2(a)(15)(ii)(C) and is revising that provision. The Bureau is amending new § 1026.2(a)(15)(ii)(C) and existing comment 2(a)(15)-4 to provide that the exception does not apply to a covered separate credit feature accessible by an account number where the account number is a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 and a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Generally, to be a “credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan,” the credit must be “open-end credit,” as defined in existing § 1026.2(a)(20), that is not home-secured and the open-end (not home-secured) credit plan must be accessible by a “credit card,” as defined in final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i). As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(20) below, the Bureau anticipates that most covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards will meet the definition of “open-end credit” and that credit will not be home-secured.&lt;footnote ref="605"&gt;As discussed in more detail below in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(17), a person is not a creditor that is extending open-end credit where the person offers a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card and a finance charge is not imposed in connection with the credit. Nonetheless, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(17), such a person would still be subject to certain Regulation Z requirements under certain circumstances.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             In addition, under the final rule, a prepaid card that is a hybrid prepaid-credit card as discussed in new § 1026.61 is a credit card under Regulation Z with respect to the covered separate credit feature. Thus, the Bureau anticipates that most covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards will meet the definition of “credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan” in final § 1026.2(a)(15)(ii).&lt;footnote ref="606"&gt;The Bureau plans to monitor the development of covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards after the final rule becomes effective.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             These covered separate credit features will be subject to the disclosure and credit card provisions set forth in subpart B and G.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>Although current Regulation Z and its commentary use the term “debit card,” that term is not defined. Generally, under existing comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.B, the term “debit card” refers to a card that accesses an asset account. Specifically, existing comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.B provides as an example of a credit card: “A card that accesses both a credit and an asset account (that is, a debit-credit card).” In addition, existing comment 2(a)(15)-2.ii.A provides that the term credit card does not include a debit card with no credit feature or agreement, even if the creditor occasionally honors an inadvertent overdraft.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Under the proposal, different rules generally would have applied in Regulation Z depending on whether credit is accessed by a card or device that accesses a prepaid account (which would have been defined in proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(vi) to match the definition under proposed Regulation E § 1005.2(b)(3)) or a card or device that accesses another type of asset account. To assist compliance with the regulation, the proposal would have defined “debit card” for purposes of Regulation Z in proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(iv) to mean “any card, plate, or other single device that may be used from time to time to access an asset account other than a prepaid account.” The proposed definition of “debit card” would have specified that it does not include a prepaid card. Proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(v) would have defined “prepaid card” to mean “any card, code, or other device that can be used to access a prepaid account” and would have defined “prepaid account” in proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(vi) to mean a prepaid account as defined in proposed Regulation E § 1005.2(b)(3). Proposed comment 2(a)(15)-6 would have provided that the term “prepaid card” in proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(v) would have included any card, code, or other device that can be used to access a prepaid account, including a prepaid account number or other code. The proposed comment would have provided that the phrase “credit accessed by a prepaid card” means any credit that is accessed by any card, code, or other device that also can be used to access a prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive specific comment on the proposed definition of “debit card.” The Bureau is adopting the definition of “debit card” in new § 1026.2(a)(15)(iv) as proposed with one technical revision to cross-reference the definition of “prepaid account” in new § 1026.61.&lt;footnote ref="608"&gt;As in the proposal, this definition of “debit card” does not apply to Regulation E, including the rules that apply to debit cards that access checking accounts with overdraft services.&lt;/footnote&gt;

        <analysisParagraph>The proposal would have amended existing comment 12(c)(1)-1 and added proposed comment 12(c)-5 to explain that existing § 1026.12(c) would apply when goods or services are purchased using a credit card that also is a prepaid card. Proposed comment 12(c)-5 also would have provided guidance on how existing § 1026.12(c) applies to transactions at point of sale where a prepaid card that is a credit card is used to obtain goods or services from a merchant, and the transaction is partially funded by the consumer's prepaid account and partially funded by credit. For these types of transactions, proposed comment 12(c)-5 would have provided that the amount of the purchase transaction that is funded by credit generally would be subject to the requirements of existing § 1026.12(c), and it also would have provided that the amount of the transaction funded from the prepaid account would not be subject to the requirements of § 1026.12(c).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Existing comments 12(c)-3 and 12(c)(1)-1.iv provide that the provisions in existing § 1026.12(c) generally do not apply to purchases effected by use of either a check guarantee card or a debit card when used to draw on overdraft credit plans. Existing comment 12(c)(1)-1.ii also provides that the provisions in existing § 1026.12(c) do not apply to the purchase of goods or services using a check accessing an overdraft account and a credit card used solely for identification of the consumer. On the other hand, if the credit card is used to make partial payment for the purchase and not merely for identification, the right to assert claims or defenses would apply to credit extended via the credit card, although not to the credit extended on the overdraft line. The Board adopted these exceptions in 1981 as part of implementing the Truth in Lending Simplification and Reform Act.&lt;footnote ref="644"&gt;46 FR 20848, 20865 (Apr. 7, 1981); &amp;lt;em data-original="E-03"&amp;gt;see also&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; 46 FR 50288, 50313 (Oct. 9, 1981).&lt;/footnote&gt;
             In the supplemental information provided with that rulemaking, the Board indicated that it had decided to exempt check guarantee cards and debit cards when used to draw on an overdraft line because of serious operational problems cited by commenters as arising from applying the claims and defenses provisions to check guarantee and debit card transactions. The proposal would not have revised these provisions, except to revise existing comment 12(c)(1)-1.ii to specify that the comment does not apply to an overdraft line in connection with a prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comments from industry on proposed comments 12(c)(1)-1 and 12(c)-5. With respect to split-tender transactions discussed above, two consumer group commenters urged the Bureau to use its authority under TILA section 105 to extend the claim and defenses provision to the amount of the transaction that is funded from the prepaid account. They believed that doing so would help reduce consumer confusion.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting proposed comments 12(c)(1)-1 and 12(c)-5 with revisions.&lt;footnote ref="645"&gt;The proposal would have provided that the term “credit card” includes an account number that is not a prepaid card that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan that allows deposits directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. Proposed 12(c)(1)-1.i would have provided that the provision in § 1026.12(c) would not apply to an advance on a credit plan accessed by such an account number. For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) above, the final rule does not adopt the proposed changes to comment 12(c)(1)-1.i related to these account numbers.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             Consistent with the proposal, final comment 12(c)(1)-1 provides that the provisions in existing § 1026.12(c) apply to property or services purchased with the hybrid prepaid-credit card that accesses a covered separate credit feature, as defined in new § 1026.61. In addition, new comment 12(c)-5 is revised from the proposal to clarify that existing § 1026.12(c) applies to purchases made with a hybrid prepaid-credit card that accesses a covered separate credit feature, regardless of whether the covered separate credit feature is structured such that credit is transferred from the covered separate credit feature to the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the amount of the purchase transaction made with the hybrid prepaid-credit card, or whether the covered separate credit feature is structured such that credit is directly drawn from the covered separate credit feature to cover the amount of the purchase transaction made with the hybrid prepaid-credit card.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 and a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.8(a) above, the Bureau recognizes that a card issuer with respect to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card may structure the credit feature in two ways to cover situations where the consumer has insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account at the time of authorization or settlement to cover the amount of the transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. First, the covered separate credit feature could be structured such that a consumer can use a hybrid prepaid-credit card to make a purchase to obtain goods or services from a merchant, and credit is drawn directly from the covered separate credit feature without transferring funds into the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the amount of the purchase. For example, assume that the consumer has $10 of funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account and initiates a transaction with a merchant to obtain goods or services with the hybrid prepaid-credit card for $25. In this case, $10 is debited from the asset feature, and $15 of credit is drawn directly from the covered separate credit feature accessed by the hybrid prepaid-credit card without any transfer of funds into the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the amount of the purchase.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Second, the covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card could be structured such that when a consumer uses a hybrid prepaid-credit card to make a purchase to obtain goods or services from a merchant, credit is transferred from the covered separate credit feature into the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the amount of the purchase. For example, assume the same facts as above, except that the $15 is transferred from the covered separate credit feature to the asset feature, and a transaction of $25 is debited from the asset feature of the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adding new comment 12(c)-5.i to provide that both of these situations would be examples of a consumer using a hybrid prepaid-credit card to access a covered separate credit feature to purchase property or services. This is true even though the latter situation (where credit is transferred from the covered separate credit feature to the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the amount of the purchase transaction) is disclosed as nonsale credit under final § 1026.8(b).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consistent with the proposal, the Bureau has not exempted from the provisions of existing § 1026.12(c) credit extended for purchases made with hybrid prepaid-credit cards. For the reasons set forth in the &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z&lt;/em&gt; section, the Bureau believes that covered separate credit features that are accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards generally should be subject to the provisions in Regulation Z that apply to credit features accessible by credit cards.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consistent with the proposal, the Bureau also is adding new comment 12(c)-5.ii to provide that for a transaction at point of sale where a hybrid prepaid-credit card is used to obtain goods or services from a merchant and the transaction is partially paid with funds from the asset feature of the prepaid account and partially paid with credit from the covered separate credit feature, the amount of the purchase transaction that is funded by credit is subject to the requirements of existing § 1026.12(c). The amount of the transaction funded from the prepaid account is not subject to the requirements of existing § 1026.12(c).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to split-tender transactions where a purchase with the hybrid prepaid-credit card is partially paid with funds from the asset feature of the prepaid account and partially paid with credit from the covered separate credit feature, the Bureau is not using its adjustment authority under TILA section 105 to extend the claims and defenses provision in existing § 1026.12(c) to the amount of the transaction that is funded from the asset feature of the prepaid account. In split-tender transactions, the Bureau believes that the provision in existing § 1026.12(c) should only apply to the amount of the transaction that is paid with credit and is accessed by the hybrid prepaid-credit card when it is acting as a credit card to access the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons discussed in the &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z&lt;/em&gt; section, the Bureau also is retaining the existing exemptions contained in existing comments 12(c)-3 and 12(c)(1)-1.ii and iv related to purchases effected by use of either a check guarantee card or a debit card when used to draw on overdraft credit plans. Existing comments 12(c)-3 and 12(c)(1)-1.iv provide that the provisions in existing § 1026.12(c) generally do not apply to purchases effected by use of either a check guarantee card or a debit card when used to draw on overdraft credit plans. In addition, existing comment 12(c)(1)-1.ii also provides that the provisions in existing § 1026.12(c) do not apply to the purchase of goods or services by using a check accessing an overdraft account and a credit card used solely for identification of the consumer. Consistent with the proposal, the Bureau is revising the example in existing comment 12(c)(1)-1.ii to specify that the comment does not apply to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>12(d) Offsets by Card Issuer Prohibited</title>
      <analysisParagraph>TILA section 169 generally prohibits card issuers from taking any action to offset a cardholder's credit card indebtedness against funds of the cardholder held on deposit with the card issuer. Nonetheless, a card issuer would not violate this provision if the card issuer periodically deducts all or a portion of a consumer's credit card debt from the consumer's deposit account, if the periodic deductions are in accordance with a preauthorized written authorization by the consumer and the card issuer does not deduct payment for any portion of the outstanding balance that is in dispute.&lt;footnote ref="646"&gt;15 U.S.C. 1666h(a).&lt;/footnote&gt;
             This TILA section also provides that the prohibition described above does not alter or affect the right under State law of a card issuer to attach or otherwise levy upon funds of a cardholder held on deposit with the card issuer if that remedy is constitutionally available to creditors generally.&lt;footnote ref="647"&gt;15 U.S.C. 1666h(b).&lt;/footnote&gt;
             TILA section 169 is implemented by § 1026.12(d).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1026.12(d)(1) provides that a card issuer may not take any action, either before or after termination of credit card privileges, to offset a cardholder's indebtedness arising from a consumer credit transaction under the relevant credit card plan against funds of the cardholder held on deposit with the card issuer. Existing § 1026.12(d)(2) provides that the prohibition on offsets in existing § 1026.12(d)(1) does not alter or affect the right of a card issuer acting under State or Federal law to do any of the following with regard to funds of a cardholder held on deposit with the card issuer if the same procedure is constitutionally available to creditors generally: (1) Obtain or enforce a consensual security interest in the funds; (2) attach or otherwise levy upon the funds; or (3) obtain or enforce a court order relating to the funds. Existing § 1026.12(d)(3) provides that the prohibition on offsets set forth in existing § 1026.12(d)(1) does not prohibit a plan, if authorized in writing by the cardholder, under which the card issuer may periodically deduct all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt from a deposit account held with the card issuer (subject to the limitations in existing § 1026.13(d)(1)).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>2(a)(7) Card Issuer</title>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the final rule contains additional guidance on the definition of “card issuer” with respect to credit offered in connection with prepaid accounts. TILA section 103(o) defines the term “card issuer” as any person who issues a credit card, or the agent of such person with respect to such a card.&lt;footnote ref="596"&gt;15 U.S.C. 1602(o).&lt;/footnote&gt;

             Consistent with the TILA definition, Regulation Z defines the term “card issuer” in existing § 1026.2(a)(7) as “a person that issues a credit card or that person's agent with respect to the card.” The Regulation further defines the term “credit card” in existing § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) to mean “any card, plate, or other single credit device that may be used from time to time to obtain credit.” Card issuers must comply with certain provisions in Regulation Z as applicable. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; existing §§ 1026.12 and 1026.60; for card issuers offering a “credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan,” &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;see, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; existing §§ 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A), 1026.7(b)(11), and 1026.51 through 1026.59. In addition, under existing § 1026.2(a)(17)(iii) and (iv), card issuers that extend credit are considered creditors for purposes of Regulation Z.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As noted above, under TILA and Regulation Z, the definition of “card issuer” means both a person who issues a credit card as well as the person's agent with respect to the card. Comment 2(a)(7)-1 currently provides guidance on the term “agent” for purposes of the definition of “card issuer.” Specifically, current comment 2(a)(7)-1 provides that because agency relationships are traditionally defined by contract and by State or other applicable law, Regulation Z generally does not define agent. Nonetheless, current comment 2(a)(7)-1 provides that merely providing services relating to the production of credit cards or data processing for others does not make one the agent of the card issuer. In contrast, current comment 2(a)(7)-1 also provides that a financial institution may become the agent of the card issuer if an agreement between the institution and the card issuer provides that the cardholder may use a line of credit with the financial institution to pay obligations incurred by use of the credit card.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.F would have provided that the term “credit card” generally includes a prepaid card that is a single device that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan.&lt;footnote ref="597"&gt;The term “prepaid card” would have been defined in proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(v) to mean any card, code, or other device that can be used to access a “prepaid account” as that term would have been defined in proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(vi). Proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(vi) would have defined the term “prepaid account” to mean a prepaid account as defined in Regulation E proposed § 1005.2(b)(3).&lt;/footnote&gt;
             Under the proposal, a person that issues a prepaid card that is a credit card would have been a “card issuer” under existing § 1026.2(a)(7).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The proposal also would have amended existing comment 2(a)(7)-1 to provide specific guidance on the term “agent” for purposes of existing § 1026.2(a)(7) where a credit plan offered by a third party is accessed by a prepaid card that is a credit card. Under the proposal, the language of existing comment 2(a)(7)-1 would have been moved to proposed comment 2(a)(7)-1.i. In addition, the Bureau proposed to add comment 2(a)(7)-1.ii that would have built on the last sentence of current comment 2(a)(7)-1 and provided that with respect to a prepaid card that is a credit card where the card accesses a credit plan that is offered by a third party, a party offering the credit plan that is accessed by the card would have been an agent of the person issuing the prepaid card and thus, would have been a card issuer with respect to the prepaid card that is a credit card.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Under proposed comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.F, the Bureau would have excluded from the regulation as a credit card situations in which a prepaid card only accesses credit that is not subject to any finance charge, as defined in § 1026.4, or any fee described in § 1026.4(c), and is not payable by written agreement in more than four installments. Consistent with this approach, proposed comment 2(a)(7)-2 would have explained that a person is not a card issuer where a prepaid card only accesses credit meeting this description.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Two industry trade associations indicated that the Bureau should limit the expansion of the term “agent” to creditors that have a direct agreement with the prepaid account issuer so that the third-party creditor is in a position to know that it has obligations under Regulation Z with respect to the prepaid card that is a credit card. Several consumer groups supported the proposed rule to consider a third party that offers an open-end credit plan accessed by a prepaid card to be an agent of the prepaid account issuer and thus a credit card issuer with responsibilities under Regulation Z. They believed that this provision would help avoid evasion by third-party credit plans linked to prepaid cards. One consumer group commenter indicated that if the prepaid account issuer contracts with a third party to market credit to account holders, the Bureau should provide that both companies are classified as card issuers that must comply with the rules. This commenter indicated that without this safeguard, an affiliated third party could offer credit accessed by the prepaid card that would not be subject to the proposed rules.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Consistent with the general approach in § 1026.61, the Bureau is limiting the circumstances in which an unaffiliated third party that can extend credit through a separate credit feature is considered an “agent” of a prepaid account issuer relative to the proposal. As discussed in more detail below, the Bureau is moving the existing language of current comment 2(a)(7)-1 to new comment 2(a)(7)-1.i. In addition, the Bureau is adding new comment 2(a)(7)-1.ii to provide that with respect to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61 where that credit feature is offered by an affiliate or business partner of the prepaid account issuer, as those terms are defined in new § 1026.61, the affiliate or business partner offering the credit feature is an agent of the prepaid account issuer and thus, is itself a card issuer with respect to the hybrid prepaid-credit card.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In contrast, if a person offers a credit feature accessible by a prepaid card that does not meet the definition of a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61, such a person is not a “card issuer” under final § 1026.2(a)(7) with respect to the prepaid card. Accordingly, the Bureau is not finalizing language that it had proposed in comment 2(a)(7)-2 to effectuate the narrower exclusion contemplated under the proposal. Instead, the Bureau is adopting new language in final comment 2(a)(7)-2 consistent with new § 1026.61 with regard to treatment of prepaid cards that are not hybrid prepaid-credit cards as discussed in that section. Each scenario is discussed further below.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Covered Separate Credit Features Accessible by Hybrid Prepaid-Credit Cards</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i) defines a separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card` as a “covered separate credit feature.” Specifically, new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i) provides that a prepaid card is a “hybrid prepaid-credit card” with respect to a separate credit feature if the card meets the following two conditions: (1) The card can be used from time to time to access credit from the separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; and (2) the separate credit feature is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. If both conditions are met, the hybrid prepaid-credit card is a credit card under Regulation Z with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New § 1026.61(a)(5)(i) and (iii) and their related commentary define “affiliate” and “business partner” respectively. Under new § 1026.61(a)(5)(i), an affiliate is any company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another company, as set forth in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1841 &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;et seq.&lt;/em&gt;). Under new § 1026.61(a)(5)(iii), a business partner is a person (other than the prepaid account issuer or its affiliates) that can extend credit through a separate credit feature, where the person or its affiliate has an “arrangement” with a prepaid account issuer or its affiliate. New comment 61(a)(5)(iii)-1 describes two types of “arrangements” that would make such a person that can extend credit a “business partner” of the prepaid account issuer under new § 1026.61(a)(5)(iii). As described in new comment 61(a)(5)(iii)-1.i, the first arrangement is where the unaffiliated person that can extend credit, or its affiliate, has an agreement with the prepaid account issuer, or its affiliate, that allows a prepaid card from time to time to draw, transfer, or authorize a draw or transfer of credit from a separate credit feature offered by the person that can extend credit in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. New comment 61(a)(5)(iii)-1.i provides, however, that the parties are not considered to have such an agreement merely because the parties participate in a card network or payment network.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Second, new comment 61(a)(5)(iii)-1.ii provides that an unaffiliated person that can extend credit through a separate credit feature is a business partner of the prepaid account issuer if (1) the prepaid account issuer or its affiliate has a business, marketing, or promotional agreement or other arrangement with the person that can extend credit, or its affiliate, where the agreement or arrangement provides that prepaid accounts offered by the prepaid account issuer will be marketed to the customers of the person who is extending credit, or that the credit feature will be marketed to the holders of prepaid accounts offered by the prepaid account issuer (including any marketing to customers to link the separate credit feature to the prepaid account to be used as an overdraft credit feature); and (2) at the time of the marketing agreement or arrangement, or at any time afterwards, the prepaid card from time to time can draw, transfer, or authorize the draw or transfer of credit from the separate credit feature in the course of transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. In this case, this requirement is satisfied even if there is no specific agreement between the parties that the card can access the separate credit feature, as described above under new comment 61(a)(5)(iii)-1.i. For example, this requirement is satisfied even if the draw, transfer, or authorization of the draw or transfer from the separate credit feature is effectuated through a card network or payment network.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is amending the commentary to existing § 1026.2(a)(7)'s definition of card issuer to effectuate coverage of these relationships. Specifically, under the final rule, the Bureau is moving the existing language of current comment 2(a)(7)-1 to new comment 2(a)(7)-1.i. In addition, the Bureau is adding new comment 2(a)(7)-1.ii to provide that with respect to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card where that credit feature is offered by an affiliate or business partner of the prepaid account issuer, the affiliate or business partner offering the credit feature is an agent of the prepaid account issuer and thus, is itself a card issuer with respect to the hybrid prepaid-credit card. Consistent with the general existing definition of card issuer, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to consider a prepaid account issuer's affiliate or business partner to be an “agent” of the prepaid account issuer because, in those cases, there is a sufficient connection between the parties such that the affiliate or business partner should know that its credit feature is accessible by a prepaid card as an overdraft credit feature for the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that current comment 2(a)(7)-1 provides that a financial institution may become the agent of the card issuer if an agreement between the institution and the card issuer provides that the cardholder may use a line of credit with the financial institution to pay obligations incurred by use of the credit card. With regard to hybrid prepaid-credit cards, the final rule incorporates and expands upon this concept of when a person is an agent of a card issuer. The Bureau believes that the new, more expansive language provides additional clarity as to when there is an agent relationship in the prepaid context and, therefore, prevents circumvention of the final rules applicable to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards as defined by new § 1026.61 that are offered by the prepaid account issuer's affiliates or business partners.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In particular, the Bureau is concerned that without new comment 2(a)(7)-1.ii, prepaid account issuers could structure arrangements with their affiliates or business partners to avoid an agency relationship under State law. Such a result could frustrate the operation of certain consumer protections provided in the final rule. In addition, without considering the person that can extend credit through the covered separate credit feature to be an agent of the prepaid account issuer (and thus considering both the prepaid account issuer and the person that can extend credit to be “card issuers”), it may not be clear whether the person that can extend credit through the covered separate credit feature or the prepaid account issuer must comply with particular provisions in Regulation Z. For example, existing § 1026.51(a) provides that a card issuer must not open a credit card account for a consumer under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, or increase any credit limit applicable to such account, unless the card issuer considers the consumer's ability to make the required minimum periodic payments under the terms of the account based on the consumer's income or assets and the consumer's current obligations. In cases where the prepaid account issuer's affiliate or business partner offers the covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card, it would not be clear what obligations under existing § 1026.51(a), if any, apply to the prepaid account issuer (who is a “card issuer” but who is not offering the credit card account) and what obligations, if any, apply to the affiliate or business partner (who is offering the credit card account but is not a card issuer) if the affiliate or business partner were not a card issuer under final § 1026.2(a)(7) with respect to the hybrid prepaid-credit card.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, under the final rule, new comment 2(a)(7)-1.ii provides that with respect to a prepaid card that is a hybrid prepaid-credit card that can access a covered separate credit feature offered by an affiliate or business partner as those terms are defined in new § 1026.61, the affiliate or business partner offering the credit feature that is accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card is an agent of the prepaid account issuer and thus, is a card issuer with respect to the hybrid prepaid-credit card. As a result, in the example above related to existing § 1026.51(a), the affiliate or business partner would be a “card issuer” for purposes of that provision and would be required to comply with it.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Nonetheless, as discussed in more detail below and in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2), the Bureau has decided to provide that a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a credit feature that is offered by a third party that is not an affiliate or business partner of a prepaid account issuer, even if the consumer decides to link his or her prepaid card to the credit feature offered by the third party. This type of credit feature is a “non-covered separate credit feature” as defined in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii). The Bureau does not believe that it is appropriate to subject such an unrelated third party to the provisions in the final rule applicable to hybrid prepaid-credit cards. In this case, there is not a sufficient connection between the prepaid account issuer and the unrelated third party, and the unrelated third party may not know that its separate credit feature is functioning as an overdraft credit feature with respect to the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, new § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii) provides that a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature discussed above. However, as described in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii), the unrelated third party that offers the non-covered separate credit feature typically will be subject to Regulation Z in its own right based on the terms and conditions of the separate credit feature, independent of the connection to the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Credit Features That Are Not Accessible by Hybrid Prepaid-Credit Cards</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau proposed to exclude from the regulation as a credit card situations in which a prepaid card only accesses credit that is not subject to any finance charge, as defined in § 1026.4, or any fee described in § 1026.4(c), and the credit is not payable by written agreement in more than four installments. Consistent with this approach, proposed comment 2(a)(7)-2 would have explained that a person is not a card issuer where a prepaid card only accesses credit meeting this description. As discussed above, the Bureau has decided to exclude prepaid cards from being covered as credit cards under Regulation Z when they access certain specified types of credit. Accordingly, the Bureau is not finalizing language that it had proposed in comment 2(a)(7)-2 to effectuate the narrower exclusion contemplated under the proposal. Instead, the Bureau is adopting new language in final comment 2(a)(7)-2 consistent with new § 1026.61 with regard to prepaid cards that are not hybrid prepaid-credit cards, as discussed in that section. Specifically, final comment 2(a)(7)-2 provides cross-references to new § 1026.61(a), new comment 61(a)(2)-5.iii, and new comment 61(a)(4)-1.iv for guidance on the applicability of Regulation Z in connection with credit accessible by prepaid cards that are not hybrid prepaid-credit cards. The Bureau's intent is to assure that where the prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a credit feature, the person that is offering the credit feature is not deemed to be a card issuer under final § 1026.2(a)(7) with respect to the prepaid card.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61 below, the Bureau has decided to exclude prepaid cards from being covered as credit cards under Regulation Z when they access certain specified types of credit. With respect to separate credit features, there are two circumstances, described in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii), where a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card when it accesses a separate credit feature. The first is where the prepaid card cannot be used to access credit from the separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. The second is where the separate credit feature is offered by an unrelated third party, rather than the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. In addition, under new § 1026.61(a)(4), a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card when the prepaid card accesses incidental credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account where the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit. A prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 or a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) when it accesses credit from these types of credit features. For more detailed explanations of when prepaid cards are not credit cards under Regulation Z, see the section-by-section analyses of § 1026.61(a)(2) and (4) below.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>TILA section 127(b) identifies information about an open-end account or credit card account that must be disclosed when a creditor is required to provide periodic statements.&lt;footnote ref="631"&gt;15 U.S.C. 1637(b); &amp;lt;em data-original="E-03"&amp;gt;see also&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; 15 U.S.C. 1602(g).&lt;/footnote&gt;
             TILA section 127(b) is implemented in existing § 1026.7.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The periodic statement requirements in existing § 1026.7 generally apply to a “creditor” as defined in existing § 1026.2(a)(17) that extends “open-end credit” as defined in existing § 1026.2(a)(20). The periodic statement requirements in existing § 1026.7 also generally apply to card issuers that extend credit, as set forth in existing § 1026.2(a)(17)(iii) and (iv). These card issuers generally are considered “creditors” for purposes of the periodic statement requirements.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1026.7(b) sets forth the content requirements for periodic statements given with respect to open-end plans or credit card accounts that are not home-secured. Generally, under existing § 1026.7(b), such periodic statements must include, among other things, information about: (1) The amount of the balance outstanding at the beginning of the billing cycle; (2) any credit to the account during the billing cycle, such as payments; (3) any credit transactions that occurred during a billing cycle, described in accordance with existing § 1026.8; (4) the APRs that may be used to compute interest charges during the billing cycle; (5) the amount of the balance to which an APR was applied and an explanation of how that balance was determined; (6) the amount of each “charge imposed as part of the plan” incurred during the billing cycle; (7) the date by which or the time period within which the new balance or any portion of the new balance must be paid to avoid additional finance charges; (8) the closing date of the billing cycle and the account balance outstanding on that date; and (9) the due date for a payment with respect to a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, any “charge imposed as part of the plan,” as that term is defined in existing § 1026.6(b)(3), must be disclosed on the Regulation Z periodic statement if it was incurred during the billing cycle. If the charges imposed as part of the plan are interest charges, these charges must be itemized by type of transaction, and the total interest charges that were imposed during the billing cycle and year to date must also be disclosed. If the charges imposed as part of the plan are fees other than interest charges, these fees must be itemized by type, and the total fee charges that were imposed during the billing cycle and year to date must be disclosed.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1026.7(b)(13) requires that certain disclosures on the Regulation Z periodic statement must be disclosed on the front of the first page of the periodic statement. Existing comment 7(b)(13)-1 explains that some financial institutions provide information about deposit account and open-end credit account activity on one periodic statement. This existing comment provides that for purposes of providing disclosures on the front of the first page of the periodic statement pursuant to existing § 1026.7(b)(13), the first page of such a combined statement shall be the page on which credit transactions first appear.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1026.5(a)(1)(iii) also provides that certain disclosures required by subpart B, including periodic statements required under § 1026.7, may be provided to the consumer in electronic form, subject to compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The periodic statement requirements in final § 1026.7(b) apply to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards because card issuers that extend credit under those credit features are “creditors” that are subject to the periodic statement requirements in final § 1026.7, pursuant to existing § 1026.2(a)(17)(iii) or (iv). As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 and a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Periodic Statements Under Regulations E and Z</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Under the proposal, under Regulation E, periodic statements would have been required under existing § 1005.9(b) to disclose non-credit transactions on the prepaid account, unless the financial institution complied with proposed § 1005.18(c). Specifically, in lieu of providing periodic statements required under § 1005.9(b), proposed § 1005.18(c)(1) would have permitted a financial institution to make available to the consumer: (1) The consumer's account balance through a readily available telephone line; (2) an electronic history of the consumer's account transactions, such as through a Web site, that covers at least 18 months preceding the date the consumer electronically accesses the account; and (3) a written history of the consumer's account transactions that is provided promptly in response to an oral or written request and that covers at least 18 months preceding the date the financial institution receives the consumer's request.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, under the proposal, a creditor would have been required to provide a Regulation Z periodic statement with respect to credit features accessed by prepaid cards that are credit cards because card issuers that extend credit under those credit features would have been “creditors” that are subject to the periodic statement requirements in proposed § 1026.7(b), pursuant to existing § 1026.2(a)(17)(iii) or (iv).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One industry trade association urged the Bureau not to impose a Regulation Z periodic statement requirement in addition to the Regulation E statement requirement. This commenter believed that dual statements would add to consumer confusion. This commenter believed that the Regulation E statement requirements should be modified to disclose the finance charge and payment information that otherwise would be included in a Regulation Z statement.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One consumer group commenter indicated that a periodic statement under Regulation Z should be required, and supported allowing a financial institution to combine the Regulations E and Z periodic statements, so long as the combined periodic statement meets the requirements of both regulations.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Under the final rule, a creditor is required to provide a Regulation Z periodic statement under final § 1026.7(b) with respect to a covered separate credit feature that is accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card because card issuers that extend credit under those credit features are “creditors” that are subject to the periodic statement requirements in final § 1026.7(b), pursuant to existing § 1026.2(a)(17)(iii) or (iv).&lt;footnote ref="632"&gt;The proposal would have provided that the term “credit card” includes an account number that is not a prepaid card that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan that allows deposits directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. Under the proposal, Regulation Z periodic statements would have been required with respect to credit card accounts that are accessed by these account numbers. For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) above, the final rule does not adopt the provisions related to the account numbers that would have made these account numbers into credit cards under Regulation Z.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             The Bureau does not believe that modifying the Regulation E periodic statement requirement in existing § 1005.9(b) or the requirement to provide electronic and written account transaction histories pursuant to the periodic statement alternative in final § 1005.18(c)(1) to include disclosures pertaining to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card would benefit consumers. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(b) below, new § 1026.61(b) prohibits an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner in connection with a prepaid account from being structured as a negative balance to the asset feature of the prepaid account, except for overdraft credit features described in new § 1026.61(a)(4). Instead, a card issuer must structure an overdraft credit feature in connection with a prepaid account as a separate credit feature, such as a credit account or credit subaccount to the prepaid account that is separate from the asset feature of the prepaid account, except for overdraft credit features described in new § 1026.61(a)(4). This separate credit feature is a “covered separate credit feature” under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that retaining the requirement to provide a Regulation Z periodic statement with respect to such an overdraft credit feature that is structured as a separate credit feature will reinforce for consumers that this credit feature is separate from the asset feature of the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, existing § 1026.7(b)(13) requires that certain disclosures on the Regulation Z periodic statement must be disclosed on the front of the first page of the periodic statement. Existing comment 7(b)(13)-1 explains that some financial institutions provide information about deposit account and open-end credit account activity on one periodic statement. This existing comment provides that for purposes of providing disclosures on the front of the first page of the periodic statement pursuant to existing § 1026.7(b)(13), the first page of such a combined statement is the page on which credit transactions first appear. To facilitate compliance, the Bureau is amending comment 7(b)(13)-1 to provide that the guidance in this comment also applies to financial institutions that provide information about prepaid accounts and account activity in connection with covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards as defined in § 1026.61 on one periodic statement. This revision to final comment 7(b)(13)-1 clarifies that if a financial institution elects to provide a periodic statement under existing Regulation E § 1005.9(b) to a holder of the prepaid account, the financial institution is permitted to combine the Regulation E and Regulation Z periodic statements. In this case, the financial institution must satisfy the requirements of both Regulation E and Regulation Z in providing the combined statement. If a financial institution instead elects to follow the periodic statement alternative set forth in final Regulation E § 1005.18(c)(1), the financial institution still is required to provide Regulation Z periodic statements in writing pursuant to final § 1026.7. Under existing § 1026.5(a)(1)(iii), financial institutions are permitted to provide the Regulation Z periodic statements in electronic form, subject to compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act.</analysisParagraph>

        <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1026.7(b)(6) provides that a creditor must disclose on the Regulation Z periodic statement, among other things, information about the amount of each “charges imposed as part of the plan,” as that term is defined in existing § 1026.6(b)(3), if the charge was incurred during the billing cycle. If the charges imposed as part of the plan are interest charges, these charges must be itemized by type of transaction, and the total interest charges that were imposed during the billing cycle and year to date must also be disclosed. If the charges imposed as part of the plan are fees other than interest charges, these charges must be itemized by type, and the total fee charges that were imposed during the billing cycle and year to date must be disclosed.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards.&lt;/em&gt; As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.6(b)(3) above, the Bureau is adding guidance in new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D) and new comment 61(b)(3)(iii)(D)-1 on whether fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account are “charges imposed as part of the plan” under final § 1026.6(b)(3) with respect to a covered separate credit feature where the credit feature and the asset feature are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 and a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Under the final rule, new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D) provides that with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, as defined in new § 1026.61, the term “charges imposed as part of the plan” with respect to the covered separate credit feature does not include any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account to the extent that the amount of the fee or charge does not exceed comparable fees or charges imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. As described in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.4(b)(11) above, these fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are not finance charges under new § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) with respect to the covered separate credit feature. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) above, the Bureau believes that to the extent that a prepaid account issuer charges the same comparable fee on the asset balance of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature as the fee that it charges on a prepaid account in the same prepaid account program without such a credit feature, the fee is not related to credit, and thus, is not a finance charge. As such, the Bureau believes that these fees are more appropriately disclosed on the Regulation E disclosures for the asset feature of the prepaid account and should not be disclosed as well on the Regulation Z disclosures with respect to the covered separate credit feature. Thus, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.6 above, the Bureau is excluding these fees or charges from the term “charges imposed as part of the plan” with respect to covered separate credit features under new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D). Because these fees or charges are not charges imposed as part of the plan, these fees or charges are not required to be disclosed on the Regulation Z periodic statement under existing § 1026.7(b)(6) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account must be disclosed on the Regulation E periodic statement pursuant to existing § 1005.9(b), or on the electronic and written account transaction histories pursuant to the periodic statement alternative under final Regulation E § 1005.18(c)(1).

        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Non-covered separate credit features.&lt;/em&gt; As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61 below, the Bureau has decided not to regulate a prepaid card as a credit card under Regulation Z when it accesses credit from certain credit features. For example, under § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii), a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a “non-covered separate credit feature,” which means that the separate credit feature either (1) cannot be accessed in the course of a prepaid card transaction to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; or (2) is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. A non-covered separate credit feature is not subject to the rules applicable to hybrid prepaid-credit cards; however, it typically will be subject to Regulation Z depending on its own terms and conditions, independent of the connection to the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.6 above, to facilitate compliance with the disclosure requirements in final § 1026.6(b)(2) through (3) for non-covered separate credit features that are subject to existing § 1026.6, the final rule provides guidance on how the disclosure requirements in final § 1026.6(b)(2) and (3) apply to fees and charges imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account in relation to non-covered separate credit features accessible by prepaid cards. Specifically, new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(E) and new comment 61(b)(3)(iii)(E)-1 provide that with regard to a non-covered separate credit feature accessible by a prepaid card, as defined in new § 1026.61, the term “charges imposed as part of the plan” does not include any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account. New comment 6(b)(3)(iii)(E)-1 also cross-references new comment 4(b)(11)-1.ii.B, which provides that fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are not finance charges with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.6 above, the Bureau believes that these fees or charges are more appropriately disclosed on the Regulation E disclosures for the asset feature of the prepaid account and should not be disclosed as well on the Regulation Z disclosures with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature.

Because these fees or charges are not charges imposed as part of the plan, these fees or charges are not required to be disclosed on the Regulation Z periodic statement under existing § 1026.7(b)(6) with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature that are subject to final § 1026.7. As discussed above, fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account must be disclosed on the Regulation E periodic statement under existing § 1005.9(b) or on the electronic and written account transaction histories provided to consumers pursuant to the periodic statement alternative set forth in final Regulation E § 1005.18(c)(1). &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See also&lt;/em&gt; final Regulation E § 1005.18(c)(4).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>7(b)(11) Due Date; Late Payment Costs</title>
      <analysisParagraph>TILA sections 127(b)(12) and (o), which are implemented in existing § 1026.7(b)(11)(i), set forth requirements related to the disclosure of payment due dates on periodic statements in the case of a credit card account under an open-end consumer credit plan.&lt;footnote ref="633"&gt;15 U.S.C. 1637(b)(12), (o).&lt;/footnote&gt;
             Under existing § 1026.7(b)(11)(i), for a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, a card issuer generally must provide on each periodic statement: (1) The due date for a payment, and the due date disclosed must be the same day of the month for each billing cycle; and (2) the amount of any late payment fee and any increased periodic rate(s) (expressed as an APR(s)) that may be imposed on the account as a result of a late payment. Existing § 1026.7(b)(11)(ii) provides, however, that the requirements of existing § 1026.(b)(11)(i) do not apply to the following: (1) Periodic statements provided solely for charge card accounts; and (2) periodic statements provided for a charged-off account where payment of the entire account balance is due immediately.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As also noted in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.5(b)(2)(ii) above, although TILA sections 127(b)(12) and (o) do not, on their face, exclude charge card accounts that are open-end credit from the requirement to disclose the due date on each periodic statement, the Board in implementing these provisions set forth in existing § 1026.7(b)(11)(ii)(A) provided that the payment due date requirement and other disclosures set forth in existing § 1026.7(b)(11)(i) do not apply to periodic statements provided solely for charge card accounts. In the supplemental information to the final rule adopting the exclusion for charge cards from the due date disclosure requirement, the Board noted that charge cards are typically products where outstanding balances cannot be carried over from one billing cycle to the next and are payable when the periodic statement is received.&lt;footnote ref="634"&gt;75 FR 7658 at 7672-7673, Feb. 22, 2010.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             Therefore, the contractual payment due date for a charge card account is the date on which the consumer receives the periodic statement (although charge card issuers generally request that the consumer make payment by some later date). If the due date disclosure requirement and the 21-day rule for delivery of periodic statements applied to charge card accounts, the card issuer could no longer require payment upon delivery of the statement. Thus, the Board concluded that it would not be appropriate to apply the payment due date disclosure in existing § 1026.7(b)(11)(i)(A) to periodic statements provided solely for charge card accounts.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The proposal would have amended existing § 1026.7(b)(11)(ii)(A) to provide that the due date disclosure does apply to periodic statements provided solely for charge card accounts where the charge card account is accessed by a charge card that is a prepaid card. Thus, under the proposal, the due date disclosure in proposed § 1026.7(b)(11)(i)(A) would have applied to periodic statements provided for a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, including a charge card account, where the account is accessed by a credit card that is a prepaid card.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One industry trade association indicated that the Bureau should not subject prepaid cards that are charge cards to rules that do not apply to other types of charge cards but did not specify why this specific proposal was not necessary.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting § 1026.7(b)(11)(ii)(A) as proposed, with revisions to be consistent with new § 1026.61. Specifically, final § 1026.7(b)(11)(ii)(A) provides that the due date disclosure does apply to periodic statements provided for covered separate credit features that are charge card accounts accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, as defined in § 1026.61, where the charge card account is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan.&lt;footnote ref="635"&gt;The proposal would have provided that the term “credit card” includes an account number that is not a prepaid card that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan that allows deposits directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. Proposed § 1026.7(b)(11)(ii)(A)(&amp;lt;em data-original="E-03"&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;) would have provided that the due date disclosure set forth in § 1026.7(b)(11)(i)(A) does apply to periodic statements provided solely for charge card accounts where the charge card accounts are accessed by such account numbers. For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) above, the final rule does not adopt the proposed changes to § 1026.7(b)(11)(ii)(A)(&amp;lt;em data-original="E-03"&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;) related to these account numbers.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             Thus, under the final rule, the due date disclosure in final § 1026.7(b)(11)(i)(A) applies to periodic statements provided for covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, including charge card accounts, where the covered separate credit feature is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 and a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that this due date requirement, the requirement in final § 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A), and the changes to the offset prohibition in final § 1026.12(d)(3), will ensure that the due date of a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card that is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan is not so closely aligned with the timing of when funds are deposited into the prepaid account that card issuers can circumvent the offset prohibition.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.12(d)(3) below, the Bureau is concerned that with respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, including charge card accounts, that are credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, some card issuers may attempt to circumvent the prohibition on offsets by specifying that each transaction on the covered separate credit feature is due on the date on which funds are subsequently deposited into the account, and obtaining a consumer's written authorization to deduct all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt when deposits are received into the prepaid account to help ensure that the debt is repaid. The Bureau believes that card issuers that offer covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards may rely significantly on obtaining a consumer's written authorization of daily or weekly debits to the prepaid account to repay the credit card debt given the overall creditworthiness of prepaid accountholders who choose to use covered separate credit features. The Bureau also believes that card issuers that offer covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards may be able to obtain a consumer's written authorization to debit the prepaid account for the credit card debt more easily than for other types of credit card accounts because consumers may believe that, in order to obtain credit, they have no alternative but to provide written authorization to allow a card issuer to deduct all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt from the linked prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The revisions adopted in final § 1026.7(b)(11), along with the changes adopted in final § 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A), in the offset provisions in final § 1026.12(d)(3), and in the compulsory use provisions in final Regulation E § 1005.10(e)(1), would mean, respectively, that with respect to covered separate credit features that are accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, including charge card accounts, that are credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, card issuers: (1) Would be required to adopt reasonable procedures designed to ensure that periodic statements for the covered separate credit features are mailed or delivered at least 21 days prior to the payment due date disclosed on the periodic statement and the due date disclosed must be the same day of the month for each billing cycle; (2) could move funds automatically from the asset account held by the card issuer to the covered separate credit feature held by the card issuer to pay some or all of the credit card debt no more frequently than once per month, such as on the payment due date (pursuant to the consumer's signed, written agreement that the issuer may do so); and (3) would be required to offer consumers a means to repay their outstanding credit balances on the covered separate credit feature other than automatic repayment (such as by means of a transfer of funds from the asset account to the credit account that the consumer initiates on the prepaid account's online banking Web site following a cash reload to the asset account).</analysisParagraph>

             TILA section 127(b) is implemented in existing § 1026.7.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The periodic statement requirements in existing § 1026.7 generally apply to a “creditor” as defined in existing § 1026.2(a)(17) that extends “open-end credit” as defined in existing § 1026.2(a)(20). The periodic statement requirements in existing § 1026.7 also generally apply to card issuers that extend credit, as set forth in existing § 1026.2(a)(17)(iii) and (iv). These card issuers generally are considered “creditors” for purposes of the periodic statement requirements.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1026.7(b) sets forth the content requirements for periodic statements given with respect to open-end plans or credit card accounts that are not home-secured. Generally, under existing § 1026.7(b), such periodic statements must include, among other things, information about: (1) The amount of the balance outstanding at the beginning of the billing cycle; (2) any credit to the account during the billing cycle, such as payments; (3) any credit transactions that occurred during a billing cycle, described in accordance with existing § 1026.8; (4) the APRs that may be used to compute interest charges during the billing cycle; (5) the amount of the balance to which an APR was applied and an explanation of how that balance was determined; (6) the amount of each “charge imposed as part of the plan” incurred during the billing cycle; (7) the date by which or the time period within which the new balance or any portion of the new balance must be paid to avoid additional finance charges; (8) the closing date of the billing cycle and the account balance outstanding on that date; and (9) the due date for a payment with respect to a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, any “charge imposed as part of the plan,” as that term is defined in existing § 1026.6(b)(3), must be disclosed on the Regulation Z periodic statement if it was incurred during the billing cycle. If the charges imposed as part of the plan are interest charges, these charges must be itemized by type of transaction, and the total interest charges that were imposed during the billing cycle and year to date must also be disclosed. If the charges imposed as part of the plan are fees other than interest charges, these fees must be itemized by type, and the total fee charges that were imposed during the billing cycle and year to date must be disclosed.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1026.7(b)(13) requires that certain disclosures on the Regulation Z periodic statement must be disclosed on the front of the first page of the periodic statement. Existing comment 7(b)(13)-1 explains that some financial institutions provide information about deposit account and open-end credit account activity on one periodic statement. This existing comment provides that for purposes of providing disclosures on the front of the first page of the periodic statement pursuant to existing § 1026.7(b)(13), the first page of such a combined statement shall be the page on which credit transactions first appear.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1026.5(a)(1)(iii) also provides that certain disclosures required by subpart B, including periodic statements required under § 1026.7, may be provided to the consumer in electronic form, subject to compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The periodic statement requirements in final § 1026.7(b) apply to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards because card issuers that extend credit under those credit features are “creditors” that are subject to the periodic statement requirements in final § 1026.7, pursuant to existing § 1026.2(a)(17)(iii) or (iv). As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 and a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Periodic Statements Under Regulations E and Z</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Under the proposal, under Regulation E, periodic statements would have been required under existing § 1005.9(b) to disclose non-credit transactions on the prepaid account, unless the financial institution complied with proposed § 1005.18(c). Specifically, in lieu of providing periodic statements required under § 1005.9(b), proposed § 1005.18(c)(1) would have permitted a financial institution to make available to the consumer: (1) The consumer's account balance through a readily available telephone line; (2) an electronic history of the consumer's account transactions, such as through a Web site, that covers at least 18 months preceding the date the consumer electronically accesses the account; and (3) a written history of the consumer's account transactions that is provided promptly in response to an oral or written request and that covers at least 18 months preceding the date the financial institution receives the consumer's request.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, under the proposal, a creditor would have been required to provide a Regulation Z periodic statement with respect to credit features accessed by prepaid cards that are credit cards because card issuers that extend credit under those credit features would have been “creditors” that are subject to the periodic statement requirements in proposed § 1026.7(b), pursuant to existing § 1026.2(a)(17)(iii) or (iv).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One industry trade association urged the Bureau not to impose a Regulation Z periodic statement requirement in addition to the Regulation E statement requirement. This commenter believed that dual statements would add to consumer confusion. This commenter believed that the Regulation E statement requirements should be modified to disclose the finance charge and payment information that otherwise would be included in a Regulation Z statement.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One consumer group commenter indicated that a periodic statement under Regulation Z should be required, and supported allowing a financial institution to combine the Regulations E and Z periodic statements, so long as the combined periodic statement meets the requirements of both regulations.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Under the final rule, a creditor is required to provide a Regulation Z periodic statement under final § 1026.7(b) with respect to a covered separate credit feature that is accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card because card issuers that extend credit under those credit features are “creditors” that are subject to the periodic statement requirements in final § 1026.7(b), pursuant to existing § 1026.2(a)(17)(iii) or (iv).&lt;footnote ref="632"&gt;The proposal would have provided that the term “credit card” includes an account number that is not a prepaid card that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan that allows deposits directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. Under the proposal, Regulation Z periodic statements would have been required with respect to credit card accounts that are accessed by these account numbers. For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) above, the final rule does not adopt the provisions related to the account numbers that would have made these account numbers into credit cards under Regulation Z.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             The Bureau does not believe that modifying the Regulation E periodic statement requirement in existing § 1005.9(b) or the requirement to provide electronic and written account transaction histories pursuant to the periodic statement alternative in final § 1005.18(c)(1) to include disclosures pertaining to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card would benefit consumers. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(b) below, new § 1026.61(b) prohibits an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner in connection with a prepaid account from being structured as a negative balance to the asset feature of the prepaid account, except for overdraft credit features described in new § 1026.61(a)(4). Instead, a card issuer must structure an overdraft credit feature in connection with a prepaid account as a separate credit feature, such as a credit account or credit subaccount to the prepaid account that is separate from the asset feature of the prepaid account, except for overdraft credit features described in new § 1026.61(a)(4). This separate credit feature is a “covered separate credit feature” under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that retaining the requirement to provide a Regulation Z periodic statement with respect to such an overdraft credit feature that is structured as a separate credit feature will reinforce for consumers that this credit feature is separate from the asset feature of the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, existing § 1026.7(b)(13) requires that certain disclosures on the Regulation Z periodic statement must be disclosed on the front of the first page of the periodic statement. Existing comment 7(b)(13)-1 explains that some financial institutions provide information about deposit account and open-end credit account activity on one periodic statement. This existing comment provides that for purposes of providing disclosures on the front of the first page of the periodic statement pursuant to existing § 1026.7(b)(13), the first page of such a combined statement is the page on which credit transactions first appear. To facilitate compliance, the Bureau is amending comment 7(b)(13)-1 to provide that the guidance in this comment also applies to financial institutions that provide information about prepaid accounts and account activity in connection with covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards as defined in § 1026.61 on one periodic statement. This revision to final comment 7(b)(13)-1 clarifies that if a financial institution elects to provide a periodic statement under existing Regulation E § 1005.9(b) to a holder of the prepaid account, the financial institution is permitted to combine the Regulation E and Regulation Z periodic statements. In this case, the financial institution must satisfy the requirements of both Regulation E and Regulation Z in providing the combined statement. If a financial institution instead elects to follow the periodic statement alternative set forth in final Regulation E § 1005.18(c)(1), the financial institution still is required to provide Regulation Z periodic statements in writing pursuant to final § 1026.7. Under existing § 1026.5(a)(1)(iii), financial institutions are permitted to provide the Regulation Z periodic statements in electronic form, subject to compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act.</analysisParagraph>

        <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1026.7(b)(6) provides that a creditor must disclose on the Regulation Z periodic statement, among other things, information about the amount of each “charges imposed as part of the plan,” as that term is defined in existing § 1026.6(b)(3), if the charge was incurred during the billing cycle. If the charges imposed as part of the plan are interest charges, these charges must be itemized by type of transaction, and the total interest charges that were imposed during the billing cycle and year to date must also be disclosed. If the charges imposed as part of the plan are fees other than interest charges, these charges must be itemized by type, and the total fee charges that were imposed during the billing cycle and year to date must be disclosed.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards.&lt;/em&gt; As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.6(b)(3) above, the Bureau is adding guidance in new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D) and new comment 61(b)(3)(iii)(D)-1 on whether fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account are “charges imposed as part of the plan” under final § 1026.6(b)(3) with respect to a covered separate credit feature where the credit feature and the asset feature are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 and a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Under the final rule, new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D) provides that with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, as defined in new § 1026.61, the term “charges imposed as part of the plan” with respect to the covered separate credit feature does not include any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account to the extent that the amount of the fee or charge does not exceed comparable fees or charges imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. As described in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.4(b)(11) above, these fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are not finance charges under new § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) with respect to the covered separate credit feature. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) above, the Bureau believes that to the extent that a prepaid account issuer charges the same comparable fee on the asset balance of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature as the fee that it charges on a prepaid account in the same prepaid account program without such a credit feature, the fee is not related to credit, and thus, is not a finance charge. As such, the Bureau believes that these fees are more appropriately disclosed on the Regulation E disclosures for the asset feature of the prepaid account and should not be disclosed as well on the Regulation Z disclosures with respect to the covered separate credit feature. Thus, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.6 above, the Bureau is excluding these fees or charges from the term “charges imposed as part of the plan” with respect to covered separate credit features under new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D). Because these fees or charges are not charges imposed as part of the plan, these fees or charges are not required to be disclosed on the Regulation Z periodic statement under existing § 1026.7(b)(6) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account must be disclosed on the Regulation E periodic statement pursuant to existing § 1005.9(b), or on the electronic and written account transaction histories pursuant to the periodic statement alternative under final Regulation E § 1005.18(c)(1). See the section-by-section analysis of Regulation E § 1005.18(c)(1) above.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Non-covered separate credit features.&lt;/em&gt; As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61 below, the Bureau has decided not to regulate a prepaid card as a credit card under Regulation Z when it accesses credit from certain credit features. For example, under § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii), a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a “non-covered separate credit feature,” which means that the separate credit feature either (1) cannot be accessed in the course of a prepaid card transaction to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; or (2) is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. A non-covered separate credit feature is not subject to the rules applicable to hybrid prepaid-credit cards; however, it typically will be subject to Regulation Z depending on its own terms and conditions, independent of the connection to the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.6 above, to facilitate compliance with the disclosure requirements in final § 1026.6(b)(2) through (3) for non-covered separate credit features that are subject to existing § 1026.6, the final rule provides guidance on how the disclosure requirements in final § 1026.6(b)(2) and (3) apply to fees and charges imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account in relation to non-covered separate credit features accessible by prepaid cards. Specifically, new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(E) and new comment 61(b)(3)(iii)(E)-1 provide that with regard to a non-covered separate credit feature accessible by a prepaid card, as defined in new § 1026.61, the term “charges imposed as part of the plan” does not include any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account. New comment 6(b)(3)(iii)(E)-1 also cross-references new comment 4(b)(11)-1.ii.B, which provides that fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are not finance charges with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.6 above, the Bureau believes that these fees or charges are more appropriately disclosed on the Regulation E disclosures for the asset feature of the prepaid account and should not be disclosed as well on the Regulation Z disclosures with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature. Thus, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.6 above, the Bureau is excluding these fees or charges from the term “charges imposed as part of the plan” with respect to non-covered separate credit features under new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(E). Because these fees or charges are not charges imposed as part of the plan, these fees or charges are not required to be disclosed on the Regulation Z periodic statement under existing § 1026.7(b)(6) with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature that are subject to final § 1026.7. As discussed above, fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account must be disclosed on the Regulation E periodic statement under existing § 1005.9(b) or on the electronic and written account transaction histories provided to consumers pursuant to the periodic statement alternative set forth in final Regulation E § 1005.18(c)(1). &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See also&lt;/em&gt; final Regulation E § 1005.18(c)(4).</analysisParagraph>

        <analysisParagraph>One consumer group commenter indicated that the Bureau should prohibit creditors from making consumers consent to electronic communications a condition of a credit feature and from charging fees for providing paper periodic statements under Regulation Z. The consumer group commenter indicated that while it believes that this prohibition should apply to all credit cards and open-end credit, the commenter was particularly concerned that prepaid cardholders whose cards are linked to credit will be coerced into accepting electronic communications even if paper would serve them better.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes the change is beyond the scope of the proposal, and the change is not warranted at this time.

      <title>5(b)(2)(ii) Timing Requirements</title>
      <analysisParagraph>TILA sections 127(b) and 163, which are implemented in existing § 1026.5(b)(2), set forth the timing requirements for providing periodic statements for open-end credit accounts and credit card accounts.&lt;footnote ref="626"&gt;15 U.S.C. 1637(b) and 1666b; &amp;lt;em data-original="E-03"&amp;gt;see also&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; 15 U.S.C. 1602(g).&lt;/footnote&gt;
             Existing § 1026.5(b)(2)(i) provides that a creditor that extends open-end credit or credit accessible by a credit card generally is required to provide a periodic statement, as required by existing § 1026.7, for each billing cycle at the end of which an account has a debit or credit balance of more than $1 or on which a finance charge has been imposed.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A) provides that for credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, a card issuer must adopt reasonable procedures designed to ensure that: (1) Periodic statements for those accounts are mailed or delivered at least 21 days prior to the payment due date disclosed on the statement pursuant to existing § 1026.7(b)(11)(i)(A); and (2) the card issuer does not treat as late for any purpose a required minimum periodic payment received by the card issuer within 21 days after mailing or delivery of the periodic statement disclosing the due date for that payment. See the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(15)(ii) above for a discussion of the term “credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan.”</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>TILA sections 127(b)(12) and (o), which are implemented in existing § 1026.7(b)(11)(i)(A), set forth requirements related to the disclosure of payment due dates on periodic statements in the case of a credit card account under an open-end consumer credit plan.&lt;footnote ref="627"&gt;15 U.S.C. 1637(b)(12), (o).&lt;/footnote&gt;
             Existing § 1026.7(b)(11)(i)(A) provides that for a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, a card issuer must provide on each periodic statement the due date for a payment. In addition, the due date disclosed must be the same day of the month for each billing cycle.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Although TILA sections 127(b)(12) and (o) do not, on their face, exclude charge card accounts that are open-end credit, the Board, in implementing these provisions, set forth in existing § 1026.7(b)(11)(ii)(A) that the payment due date requirement in existing § 1026.7(b)(11)(i)(A) does not apply to periodic statements provided solely for charge card accounts. Thus, as explained in existing comment 5(b)(2)(ii)-4.i, the requirement in existing § 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;) to adopt reasonable procedures designed to ensure that periodic statements are mailed or delivered at least 21 days prior to the payment due date disclosed on the periodic statement does not apply to charge card accounts. In the supplemental information to the final rule adopting the exclusion for charge cards from the due date disclosure requirement, the Board noted that charge cards are typically products where outstanding balances cannot be carried over from one billing cycle to the next and are payable when the periodic statement is received.&lt;footnote ref="628"&gt;75 FR 7658 at 7672-7673, Feb. 22, 2010.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             Therefore, the contractual payment due date for a charge card account is the date on which the consumer receives the periodic statement (although charge card issuers generally request that the consumer make payment by some later date). If the due date disclosure requirement and the 21-day rule for delivery of periodic statements applied to charge card account, the card issuer could no longer require payment upon delivery of the statement. Thus, the Board concluded that it would not be appropriate to apply the payment due date disclosure in existing § 1026.7(b)(11)(i)(A) to periodic statements provided solely for charge card accounts.</analysisParagraph>

        <analysisParagraph>The proposal would have amended existing § 1026.7(b)(11)(ii)(A) to provide that the due date disclosure does apply to periodic statements provided solely for charge card accounts where the charge card account is accessed by a charge card that is a prepaid card and the charge card account is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan. Thus, under the proposal, the due date disclosure in proposed § 1026.7(b)(11)(i)(A) would have applied to periodic statements provided for a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, including a charge card account, where the account is accessed by a credit card that is a prepaid card. Thus, as a technical revision, the proposal would have revised existing comment 5(b)(2)(ii)-4.i to reflect the proposed changes to existing § 1026.7(b)(11) that the due date requirement would apply to a charge card account accessed by a prepaid card that is a charge card where the charge card account is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan.

        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is modifying comment 5(b)(2)(ii)-4.i as proposed with technical revisions to clarify the intent of the comment and to be consistent with new § 1026.61. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.7(b)(11) below, the final rule provides that the due date disclosure set forth in final § 1026.7(b)(11)(i)(A) applies to periodic statements provided for a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card that is a charge card account where the charge card account is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan. Thus, as a technical revision, the final rule revises comment 5(b)(2)(ii)-4.i to state that the exception from the disclosure requirements in final § 1026.7(b)(11) for charge card accounts does not apply to covered separate credit features that are charge card accounts accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards as defined in new § 1026.61.&lt;footnote ref="629"&gt;The proposal would have provided that the term “credit card” includes an account number that is not a prepaid card that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan that allows deposits directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. Proposed comment 5(b)(2)(ii)-4.i would been revised to reflect the proposed changes to § 1026.7(b)(11) that the due date requirement does apply to charge card accounts accessed by these account numbers. For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) above, the final rule does not adopt the proposed changes to comment 5(b)(2)(ii)-4.i related to these account numbers.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 and a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analyses of §§ 1026.7(b)(11) and 1026.12(d)(3) below, the Bureau believes that it is important to provide strong protections to prepaid accountholders to ensure that they can control when and if funds are swept from their accounts to repay credit extended through a covered separate credit feature. In particular, the Bureau believes that for all covered separate credit features—including charge card accounts—accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, where these credit features are credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, the card issuer should be required to adopt reasonable procedures designed to ensure that periodic statements for these credit features are mailed or delivered at least 21 days prior to the payment due date disclosed on the statement, pursuant to final § 1026.7(b)(11)(i)(A). As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analyses of §§ 1026.7(b)(11) and 1026.12(d)(3), the Bureau believes that this requirement, along with changes to the offset prohibition in final § 1026.12(d)(3), will ensure that the due date of the covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card is not so closely aligned with the timing of when funds are deposited into the prepaid account that card issuers can circumvent TILA's offset prohibition.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.12(d)(3) below, the Bureau is concerned that with respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, some card issuers may attempt to circumvent the prohibition on offsets by both specifying that each transaction on the covered separate credit feature is due on the date on which funds are subsequently deposited into the account and obtaining a consumer's written authorization to deduct all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt from the prepaid account when deposits are received into the prepaid account. The Bureau believes that card issuers that offer covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards may rely significantly on obtaining a consumer's written authorization of daily or weekly debits to the prepaid account to repay the credit card debt given the overall creditworthiness of prepaid accountholders who choose to rely on covered separate credit features. The Bureau also believes that card issuers that offer covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards may be able to obtain a consumer's written authorization to debit the prepaid account more easily than for other types of credit card accounts because consumers may believe that, in order to obtain credit, they must provide written authorization to allow a card issuer to deduct all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt from the linked prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>52(a)(1) General Rule</title>
      <analysisParagraph>TILA section 127(n)(1) restricts the imposition of certain fees during the first year after opening a credit card account under an open-end consumer credit plan in order to restrict certain “fee harvester” or subprime credit cards that charged a large amount of fees early in the account relationship to the credit line, which significantly reduced the credit available to a consumer during the first year. Specifically, the statute provides that no payment of any fees (other than any late fee, over-the-limit fee, or fee for a payment returned for insufficient funds) may be made from the credit made available under the terms of the account where the account terms would require consumers to pay an aggregate amount of non-exempt fees in excess of 25 percent of the total amount of credit authorized under the account when the account is opened.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>This provision is implemented in existing § 1026.52(a). Specifically, existing § 1026.52(a)(1) provides that generally the total amount of fees a consumer is required to pay with respect to a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan during the first year after account opening must not exceed 25 percent of the credit limit in effect when the account is opened. Under existing § 1026.52(a)(2), fees not subject to the 25 percent restriction are late payment fees, over-the-limit fees, returned-payment fees, or fees that the consumer is not required to pay with respect to the account. Existing comment 52(a)(1)-1 provides that the 25 percent limit in existing § 1026.52(a)(1) applies to fees that the card issuer charges to the account as well as to fees that the card issuer requires the consumer to pay with respect to the account through other means (such as through a payment from the consumer's asset account to the card issuer or from another credit account provided by the card issuer).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The proposal would have amended existing comment 52(a)(1)-1 to add a prepaid account as an example of a consumer's asset account. Thus, under the proposal, for a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan that is accessed by a prepaid card that is a credit card, the 25 percent limit in existing § 1026.52(a)(1) would have applied to fees that the card issuer charges to the credit card account as well as to fees that the card issuer requires the consumer to pay with respect to the account through other means (such as through a payment to the card issuer from the consumer's prepaid account or other asset account or from another credit account provided by the card issuer). Proposed comment 52(a)(1)-1.iii and iv would have added two new examples to existing comment52(a)(1)-1 to illustrate how the prohibition in existing § 1026.52(a) would have applied to credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan that are accessed by prepaid cards that are credit cards.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One industry trade association indicated that the Bureau should not apply the 25 percent cap to fees imposed for overdrafts on prepaid accounts or should include broader exemptions for fees (such as for cash advance fees) that are more appropriately tailored for prepaid account usage. This commenter believed that the 25 percent cap on fees imposed during the first year the credit card account is opened will likely make it cost-prohibitive for issuers to provide overdraft and other credit features.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Several consumer group commenters indicated that the restriction in existing § 1026.52(a) should be expanded to apply beyond the first year after a credit feature accessed by a prepaid card that is a credit card is opened. One of the consumer groups indicated that in the alternative, the rule could state that any increase in the credit limit under a credit feature accessed by a prepaid card that is a credit card constitutes a new credit agreement and results in another year where fees cannot exceed 25 percent of the credit limit. This commenter indicated that without this safeguard, a card issuer could offer a very small amount of credit free of charge for a year, and then increase the credit limit after the first year while charging any fees it wishes, potentially causing cardholders serious harm.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Several consumer group commenters also indicated that the restriction in existing § 1026.52(a) should apply to fees that are charged by the card issuer for the credit feature prior to the credit feature being opened.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau sought comment on whether additional amendments to the regulation or commentary would be helpful to effectuate its interpretation of the statute or to facilitate compliance. For example, the Bureau sought comment on whether it would be helpful to mandate the disclosure to consumers of the initial credit line that is made available under the terms of the account, including any linked credit accounts. One consumer group commenter also indicated that with respect to a credit feature accessed by prepaid cards that are credit cards, card issuers should be required to disclose to consumers the credit limit that will apply to the credit feature. This commenter indicated that consumers should not have to guess at their credit limits. This commenter indicated that the restrictions in existing § 1026.52(a) cannot fully protect consumers unless they know what their credit limit is and can check to see if fees exceed 25 percent of that limit.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed below, consistent with the proposal, existing § 1026.52(a) applies to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card that is a “credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan,” as that term is defined in final § 1026.2(a)(15)(ii). As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 and a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau is adopting revisions to existing comment52(a)(1)-1 consistent with the proposal with a technical revision to refer to § 1026.61 for the definition of “prepaid account.” Also, the Bureau is adopting the examples in proposed comment 52(a)(1)-1.iii and iv as proposed, with several technical revisions to clarify the intent of the examples and to be consistent with new § 1026.61.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>With respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, the Bureau has not expanded the scope of the restriction in existing § 1026.52(a) to apply this restriction beyond the first year the credit feature is opened, or to apply to fees that are charged prior to account opening. In addition, the Bureau has not provided that that any increase in the credit limit under a credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card constitutes a new credit agreement and results in another year where fees cannot exceed 25 percent of the credit limit. Also, the Bureau has not exempted additional credit-related fees (such as for cash advance fees) from the restriction in existing § 1026.52(a), as requested by one industry commenter as discussed above. The Bureau believes that existing § 1026.52(a) should apply to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards in similar circumstances in which it applies to other credit card accounts that are subject to that restriction.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also has not required card issuers to disclose credit limits on covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards. For customer-service reasons and other reasons, credit card issuers typically disclose the credit limits applicable to credit card accounts to consumers even though that disclosure is not specifically required by TILA and Regulation Z. For similar reasons, the Bureau believes that card issuers that are providing covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards will have an incentive to disclose the credit limits on these credit features as well. For these reasons, the Bureau at this time does not believe that it is necessary under Regulation Z to require that card issuers providing covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards must disclose a credit limit with respect to these credit features.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1026.61 Hybrid Prepaid-Credit Cards</title>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adding new § 1026.61 which defines when a prepaid card is a credit card under Regulation Z (using the term “hybrid prepaid-credit card”). As discussed in the &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z&lt;/em&gt; section above and in more detail below, the Bureau generally intends to cover under Regulation Z overdraft credit features in connection with prepaid accounts where the credit features are offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliates, or its business partners. Section 1026.61(b) generally requires that such credit features be structured as separate subaccounts or accounts, distinct from the prepaid asset account, to facilitate transparency and compliance with various Regulation Z requirements. New § 1026.61(a)(2)(i) provides that a prepaid card is a “hybrid prepaid-credit card” with respect to a separate credit feature if the card meets the following two conditions: (1) The card can be used from time to time to access credit from the separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; and (2) the separate credit feature is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. New § 1026.61(a)(2)(i) defines such a separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as a “covered separate credit feature.” Thus, the hybrid prepaid-credit card can access both the covered separate credit feature and the asset feature of the prepaid account, and the hybrid prepaid-credit card is a credit card under Regulation Z with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New § 1026.61(c) (moved from § 1026.12(h) in the proposal) provides that with respect to a covered separate credit feature that could be accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card at any point, a card issuer must not do any of the following until 30 days after the prepaid account has been registered: (1) Open a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card; (2) make a solicitation or provide an application to open a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card; or (3) allow an existing credit feature that was opened prior to the consumer obtaining the prepaid account to become a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61 below, the Bureau also has decided to exclude prepaid cards from being covered as credit cards under Regulation Z when they access certain specified types of credit. First, new § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii) provides that a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a separate credit feature that does not meet both of the conditions above, for example, where the credit feature is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate or its business partner. Such credit features are defined as “non-covered separate credit features,” as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below. Second, under new § 1026.61(a)(4), a prepaid card also is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card when the prepaid card accesses incidental credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account where the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit. A prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 or a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) when it accesses credit from these types of credit features. For more detailed explanations of when prepaid cards are not credit cards under Regulation Z, see the section-by-section analyses of § 1026.61(a)(2) and (4) below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 61(a)-1 explains that in addition to the rules set forth in new § 1026.61, hybrid prepaid-credit cards and covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards are also subject to other rules in Regulation Z, and some of those rules and related commentary contain specific guidance related to hybrid prepaid-credit cards and covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards. For example, as discussed in the section-by-section analyses of §§ 1026.2(a)(15)(i) and 1026.61(a), a hybrid prepaid-credit card is a credit card for purposes of this regulation with respect to a covered separate credit feature. A covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card also will be a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, as defined in final § 1026.2(a)(15)(ii), if the covered separate credit feature is an open-end (not home-secured) credit plan. Thus, the provisions of Regulation Z that apply to credit cards and credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan generally will apply to hybrid prepaid-credit cards and covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards as applicable (&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;see generally&lt;/em&gt; subparts B and G). Some of those rules and related commentary contain specific guidance with respect to hybrid prepaid-credit cards and covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; the section-by-section analyses of subparts A, B and G in this final rule.</analysisParagraph>

             Consistent with the definition of credit in TILA, Regulation Z defines “credit” in existing § 1026.2(a)(14) to mean “the right to defer payment of debt or to incur debt and defer its payment.” Under existing § 1026.2(a)(17)(i), a person is a creditor if the person regularly extends consumer “credit” that is subject to a finance charge or is payable by written agreement in more than four installments (not including a down payment), and to whom the obligation is initially payable, either on the face of the note or contract, or by agreement when there is no note or contract. Under existing § 1026.2(a)(17)(iii), the term “creditor” also includes any card issuer (which is a person that issues credit cards or the person's agent) that extends credit even if no finance charge is imposed and repayment is not permitted in more than four installments.</analysisParagraph>

Several industry commenters suggested that the Bureau should consider a dollar threshold below which overdraft transactions would not be covered as “credit” under Regulation Z. For example, one credit union service organization urged the Bureau to set a threshold of $250 for when negative balances on the prepaid account are considered credit, such that negative balances on the prepaid account exceeding $250 in magnitude would meet the definition of “credit” and negative balances on the prepaid account of $250 in magnitude or below would not be “credit” under Regulation Z.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Definition of Credit</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail below, the Bureau is adopting new comment 2(a)(14)-3 as proposed with technical revisions to simplify the language of the comment and to be consistent with new § 1026.61. This comment provides that credit includes authorization of a transaction on an asset feature of a prepaid account as defined in § 1026.61 where the consumer has insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account at the time the transaction is authorized to cover the amount of the transaction. It also includes settlement of a transaction on an asset feature of a prepaid account where the consumer has insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account at the time the transaction is settled to cover the amount of the transaction. Credit also includes a transaction where the consumer has sufficient or available funds in the asset feature of a prepaid account to cover the amount of the transaction at the time the transaction is authorized but insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the transaction amount at the time the transaction is settled. The comment also includes a cross-reference to new § 1026.61 and related commentary on the applicability of this regulation to credit extended in connection with a prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau continues to believe that new comment 2(a)(14)-3 reflects a straightforward interpretation of the statutory term “credit.” The Bureau believes that plain language of the definition of “credit” in TILA covers the situation when a consumer makes a transaction that exceeds the funds in the consumer's account and a person elects to cover the transaction by advancing funds to the consumer. Nothing in the statutory definition (or elsewhere in TILA) exempts overdraft services, including those that may be offered in connection with a prepaid account. By authorizing or paying a transaction where the consumer does not have sufficient or available funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the amount of the transaction when the transaction is authorized or paid, the person is allowing the consumer to incur a debt with the person where payment of that debt is not immediate. Thus, the person, in extending overdraft funds, has provided the consumer with “the right . . . to incur debt and defer its payment.”</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau further emphasizes that the final rule does not change how overdraft services on accounts other than prepaid accounts are treated under Regulation Z. As discussed in more detail in the &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z&lt;/em&gt; section, with respect to overdraft services on checking accounts, while a person that is providing overdraft services generally would be providing credit under TILA and Regulation Z, the person generally does not meet the definition of “creditor” for purposes of Regulation Z because of certain exclusions to the definition of finance charge under final § 1026.4(c)(3). Thus, under this final rule, with respect to overdraft services on checking accounts, a financial institution that does not agree in writing to pay the items and does not structure the repayment of the credit by written agreement in more than four installments would not be a “creditor” with respect to the overdraft service under the general definition of creditor set forth in § 1026.2(a)(17)(i), even if the institution charges a fee for paying the overdraft item, because the fee would not be a “finance charge.” In addition, a person does not become a card issuer or a creditor by issuing a debit card that accesses an overdraft service. Specifically, existing comment 2(a)(15)-2.ii.A provides that a debit card is not a credit card if there is no credit feature or agreement to extend credit, even if the creditor occasionally honors an inadvertent overdraft. Thus, a person does not become a card issuer under existing § 1026.2(a)(7) and does not become a creditor under existing § 1026.2(a)(17)(iii) or (iv) by issuing a debit card that accesses an overdraft service. The final rule does not change the provisions in Regulation Z effectuating this treatment of overdraft services on accounts other than prepaid accounts.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Threshold Amount of Negative Balance</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, several industry commenters suggested that the Bureau should consider a dollar threshold below which overdraft transactions would not be covered as “credit” under Regulation Z. For example, one credit union service organization urged the Bureau to set a threshold of $250 for when overdraft funds are considered “credit” under Regulation Z, where negative balances on the prepaid account exceeding $250 in magnitude would meet the definition of “credit” and negative balances on the prepaid account of $250 in magnitude or below would not be “credit” under Regulation Z. The Bureau does not adopt such an approach. The Bureau is concerned that allowing consumers to incur substantial debt in connection with a prepaid account that most consumers do not intend to use as a credit account may pose a risk to those consumers by compromising their ability to manage and control their finances. Thus, while new § 1026.61(a)(4) would permit a prepaid account issuer to offer an incidental “payment cushion” of $10 without triggering the rules governing credit cards under Regulation Z so long as the issuer generally does not impose credit-related fees, the Bureau believes that the provision of a higher dollar amount of credit in connection with a prepaid account should be subject to full credit card protections unless otherwise excluded under new § 1026.61(a)(4).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>2(a)(17) Creditor</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Certain disclosure requirements and other requirements in TILA and Regulation Z generally apply to creditors. TILA section 103(g) generally defines the term “creditor” to mean a person who both (1) regularly extends, whether in connection with loans, sales of property or services, or otherwise, consumer credit which is payable by agreement in more than four installments or for which the payment of a finance charge is or may be required; and (2) is the person to whom the debt arising from the consumer credit transaction is initially payable on the face of the evidence of indebtedness or, if there is no such evidence of indebtedness, by agreement.&lt;footnote ref="609"&gt;15 U.S.C. 1602(g).&lt;/footnote&gt;
             Also, for purposes of certain disclosure provisions in TILA that relate to account-opening disclosures, and periodic statement disclosures, for open-end credit plans, the term “creditor” includes a card issuer whether or not the amount due is payable by agreement in more than four installments or the payment of a finance charge is or may be required.&lt;footnote ref="610"&gt;&amp;lt;em data-original="E-03"&amp;gt;Id.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&lt;/footnote&gt;
          </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Consistent with TILA, Regulation Z generally defines the term “creditor” in existing § 1026.2(a)(17)(i) to include a “person who regularly extends consumer credit that is subject to a finance charge or is payable by written agreement in more than four installments (not including a down payment), and to whom the obligation is initially payable, either on the face of the note or contract, or by agreement when there is no note or contract.” Under existing § 1026.2(a)(17)(v) and existing comment 2(a)(17)(i)-4, for open-end credit, a person regularly extends consumer credit if it had more than 25 accounts outstanding in the preceding calendar year. If a person did not meet this numerical standard in the preceding calendar year, the numerical standards must be applied to the current calendar year. In addition, under existing § 1026.2(a)(17)(iii) and (iv), the term “creditor” includes a card issuer (which is a person that issues a credit card or its agent) that extends credit. For purposes of subpart B, under existing § 1026.2(a)(17)(iii), a person also is a “creditor” if the person is a card issuer that extends credit that is not subject to a finance charge and is not payable by written agreement in more than four installments. Thus, under existing Regulation Z as generally structured, card issuers that only meet this narrow definition of creditor (&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;i.e.,&lt;/em&gt; extend credit that is not subject to a finance charge and is not payable in more than four installments) generally are subject to the open-end (not home-secured) rules and the credit card rules in subpart B, but generally need not comply with the credit card rules in subpart G, except for the credit card disclosures required by existing § 1026.60.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau's proposal generally would have applied this existing framework to the prepaid context. Thus, under the proposal, a card issuer that issues a prepaid card that is a credit card (or its agent) that extends open-end (not home-secured) credit would have met the general definition of “creditor” because the person charges a finance charge and would have been subject to the rules governing open-end (not home-secured) credit plans in subpart B and the credit card rules set forth in subparts B and G. Under existing § 1026.2(a)(17)(iv), a card issuer that issues a prepaid card that is a credit card (or its agent) that extends closed-end (not home-secured) credit would have met the general definition of “creditor” where the person charges a finance charge or extends credit payable by written agreement in more than four installments. Such person would have been subject to the closed-end provisions in subpart C and, certain open-end (not home-secured) disclosure rules in subpart B, and the credit card rules in subpart B. A card issuer that issues a prepaid card that is a credit card (or its agent), extends credit (not home-secured), and charges a fee described in § 1026.4(c), but does not charge a finance charge and does not extend credit payable by written agreement in more than four installments, would have been a “creditor” under existing § 1026.2(a)(17)(iii) and would have been subject to the open-end (not home-secured) disclosure rules and the credit card rules in subpart B.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.F, however, would have provided that a prepaid card is not a credit card when the prepaid card only accesses credit that (1) is not subject to a finance charge; (2) is not subject to fees described in § 1026.4(c); and (3) is not payable by written agreement in more than four installments. The Bureau would have clarified in proposed comment 2(a)(17)(iii)-2 that existing § 1026.2(a)(17)(iii) does not apply to a person that is extending credit that is accessed by a prepaid card where the credit meets these same three restrictions. In this case, under the proposal, the prepaid card would not have been a credit card and therefore the person issuing the card would not have been a card issuer. Prepaid account issuers that satisfied this exclusion still would have been subject to Regulation E's requirements, such as error resolution, and limits on liability for unauthorized use.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received and the Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comment on this aspect of the proposal, other than those related to general comments from industry not to cover overdraft plans offered on prepaid accounts under Regulation Z and instead cover these overdraft plans under existing Regulation E § 1005.17. See the &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z&lt;/em&gt; section for a discussion of those comments. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61 below, the Bureau is revising from the proposal the circumstances in which a prepaid card is a credit card under Regulation Z. Under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i), a prepaid card is a credit card under Regulation Z when it is a “hybrid prepaid-credit card” as defined in new § 1026.61. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See also&lt;/em&gt; new § 1026.61(a), and new comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.F. The Bureau generally intends to cover under Regulation Z overdraft credit features in connection with prepaid accounts where the credit features are offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliates, or its business partners. New § 1026.61(b) generally requires that such credit features be structured as separate subaccounts or accounts, distinct from the prepaid asset account, to facilitate transparency and compliance with various Regulation Z requirements. Specifically, new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i) provides that a prepaid card is a “hybrid prepaid-credit card” with respect to a separate credit feature if the card meets the following two conditions: (1) The card can be used from time to time to access credit from the separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; and (2) the separate credit feature is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. The term “covered separate credit feature” is defined in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i) to mean a separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as described in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i). Thus, the hybrid prepaid-credit card can access both the covered separate credit feature and the asset feature of the prepaid account, and the hybrid prepaid-credit card is a credit card under Regulation Z with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61 below, the Bureau also has decided to exclude prepaid cards from being covered as credit cards under Regulation Z when they access certain specified types of credit. First, new § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii) provides that a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a separate credit feature that does not meet both of the conditions above, for example, where the credit feature is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate or its business partner. Such credit features are defined as “non-covered separate credit features,” as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below. Second, under new § 1026.61(a)(4), a prepaid card also is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card when the prepaid card accesses incidental credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account where the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit. A prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 or a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) when it accesses credit from these types of credit features. For more detailed explanations of when prepaid cards are not credit cards under Regulation Z, see the section-by-section analyses of § 1026.61(a)(2) and (4) below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consistent with the proposal, the Bureau generally applies the existing framework for the definition of “creditor” to the prepaid context. Thus, a card issuer of a hybrid prepaid-credit card (or its agent) that extends credit under a covered separate credit feature is a “creditor” under existing § 1026.2(a)(17). The card issuer must comply with different provisions in Regulation Z depending on the type of credit extended. Under existing § 1026.2(a)(17)(iii), a card issuer of a hybrid prepaid-credit card (or its agent) that extends open-end (not home-secured) credit (and thus charges a finance charge for the credit) in connection with the covered separate credit feature is a “creditor” for purposes of the rules governing open-end (not home-secured) credit plans in subpart B in connection with the covered separate credit feature. The card issuer also must comply with the credit card rules set forth in subparts B and G with respect to the covered separate credit feature and the hybrid prepaid-credit card. Under existing § 1026.2(a)(17)(iii), a card issuer of a hybrid prepaid-credit card (or its agent) that extends credit (not home-secured) through the covered separate credit feature that is not subject to a finance charge and is not payable in more than four installments generally is a “creditor” for purposes of the open-end (not home-secured) rules in subpart B with respect to the covered separate credit feature. The card issuer also generally must comply with the credit card rules in subpart B with respect to the covered separate credit feature and the hybrid prepaid-credit card, but generally need not comply with the credit card rules in subpart G, except for the credit card disclosures required by existing § 1026.60 and the provisions in new § 1026.61.&lt;footnote ref="611"&gt;As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(15)(ii) above, certain requirements in the Credit CARD Act, which are generally set forth in subpart G, only apply to card issuers offering a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             Under existing § 1026.2(a)(17)(iv), a card issuer of a hybrid prepaid-credit card (or its agent) that extends closed-end (not home-secured) credit through the covered separate credit feature, and charges a finance charge or extends credit payable by written agreement in more than four installments is a “creditor” for purposes of the closed-end provisions in subpart C and certain open-end (not home-secured) disclosure rules in subpart B. The card issuer also generally must comply with the credit card rules in subpart B with respect to the covered separate credit feature and the hybrid prepaid-credit card, but generally need not comply with the credit card rules in subpart G except for the provisions in § 1026.61.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to guidance on the definition of “creditor” related to prepaid cards that are not hybrid prepaid-credit cards, the Bureau is revising new comment 2(a)(17)(iii)-2 from the proposal and is adding new comment 2(a)(17)(i)-8 to cross-reference new § 1026.61(a), new comment 61(a)(2)-5.iii and new comment 61(a)(4)-1.iv for guidance on the applicability of Regulation Z to prepaid cards that are not hybrid prepaid-credit cards.</analysisParagraph>

        <analysisParagraph>Existing comment 57(a)(1)-1 provides guidance on the definition of “college student credit card” which is used in the definition of “college credit card agreement.” The proposal would have amended this comment to include a prepaid card that is a credit card that is issued to any college student under a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan. Proposed comment 57(a)(1)-1 also would have provided that the definition of college student credit card includes a prepaid account that is issued to any college student where an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan may be added in connection with the prepaid account and the credit account may be accessed by a prepaid card that is a credit card.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Existing comment 57(a)(5)-1 provides guidance on the definition of “college credit card agreement.” The proposal would have amended this comment to include guidance on when an agreement related to a prepaid account would be considered a “college credit card agreement.” Proposed comment 57(a)(5)-1 would have provided that the definition of “college credit card agreement” includes a business, marketing, or promotional agreement between a card issuer and a college or university (or an affiliated organization, such as an alumni club or a foundation) if the agreement either provides for the addition of open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plans to previously-issued prepaid accounts that were issued to full-time or part-time students, where that credit account would be accessed by a prepaid card that is a credit card. Proposed comment 57(a)(5)-1 also would have provided that the definition of “college credit card agreement” includes a business, marketing, or promotional agreement between a card issuer and a college or university (or an affiliated organization, such as an alumni club or a foundation) if (1) an agreement provides for the issuance of prepaid accounts to full-time or part-time students; and (2) an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan may be added in connection with the prepaid account where that credit account may be accessed by a prepaid card that is a credit card.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Comments Received and the Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive any comment on this aspect of the proposal. The Bureau is adopting proposed comments 57(a)(1)-1 and 57(a)(5)-1 with technical revisions to clarify the intent of the comments, and to be consistent with new § 1026.61.&lt;footnote ref="679"&gt;The proposal would have provided that the term “credit card” includes an account number that is not a prepaid card that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan that allows deposits directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. The proposal would have provided in comments 57(a)(1)-1 and 57(a)(5)-1 guidance on the definitions of “college student credit card” and “college credit card agreement” related to credit card accounts that are accessed by these account numbers. For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) above, the final rule does not adopt the proposed changes to comments 57(a)(1)-1 and 57(a)(5)-1 related to these account numbers.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             Final comment 57(a)(1)-1 provides that the definition of “college student credit card” includes a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined by new § 1026.61 that is issued to any college student where the card accesses a covered separate credit feature that is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan. The definition of “college student credit card” also includes a prepaid account as defined in § 1026.61 that is issued to any college student where a covered separate credit feature that is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan may be added in the future to the prepaid account. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 and a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Final comment 57(a)(5)-1 provides that the definition of “college credit card agreement” includes a business, marketing, or promotional agreement between a card issuer and a college or university (or an affiliated organization, such as an alumni club or a foundation) if the agreement provides for the addition of a covered separate credit feature that is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card to prepaid accounts previously issued to full-time or part-time students. This definition also includes a business, marketing, or promotional agreement between a card issuer and a college or university (or an affiliated organization, such as an alumni club or a foundation) if (1) the agreement provides for the issuance of prepaid accounts as defined in § 1026.61 to full-time or part-time students; and (2) a covered separate credit feature that is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan may be added in the future to the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to the Bureau's amendments to commentary, final § 1026.57(d) requires a card issuer that is a party to one or more college credit card agreements in connection with covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards to submit annual reports to the Bureau regarding those agreements. In addition, a card issuer is required to submit agreements that provide for the issuance of prepaid accounts to full-time or part-time students even if a covered separate credit feature is not linked to the prepaid account when the prepaid accounts are issued, so long as such credit features may be added in connection with the prepaid accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(c) below, new § 1026.61(c) provides that with respect to a covered separate credit feature that could be accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card at any point, a card issuer must not do any of the following until 30 days after the prepaid account has been registered: (1) Open a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card; (2) make a solicitation or provide an application to open a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card; or (3) allow an existing credit feature that was opened prior to the consumer obtaining the prepaid account to become a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card. Thus, a prepaid card in connection with a prepaid account cannot access a covered separate credit feature at the time the prepaid account is opened. Nonetheless, the Bureau believes that the marketing efforts related to a prepaid account, including the inducements given by a card issuer to open a prepaid account, have an impact on whether consumers may request that a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card be linked to the prepaid account when such covered separate credit features are offered to them. Thus, even though a prepaid account will not have a covered separate credit feature linked to it at the time the prepaid account is opened, if a covered separate credit feature that is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card may be linked to a prepaid account as described above in the future, the prepaid account at the time of issuance would be a “college student credit card” for purposes of final § 1026.57(a)(1) if the prepaid account is issued to a college student. As a result, under the final rule, a card issuer that is a party to one or more agreements between the card issuer and a college or university (or an affiliated organization, such as an alumni club or a foundation) must submit annual reports to the Bureau regarding those agreements if: (1) An agreement provides for the issuance of prepaid accounts to full-time or part-time students; and (2) a covered separate credit feature that is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card may be added in connection with the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its adjustment authority under TILA section 105(a), to apply section 127(r)'s requirements for college card agreements to prepaid cards where covered separate credit features that are credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards may subsequently be added, to further the purposes of TILA. The provisions in TILA section 127(r) addressing college credit cards reflect Congress's particular concern with providing special protections for students to ensure that students can make informed credit decisions, and the Bureau believes that including such cards is consistent with such congressional concerns for college students and credit card debt. Further, these concerns might be heightened with respect to prepaid accounts to which covered separate credit features that are credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards may be linked because students might be prone to use such prepaid accounts as their primary transaction account.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>8(b) Nonsale Credit</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1026.8(b) provides that for each credit transaction not involving the sale of property or services, the creditor generally must disclose a brief identification of the transaction; the amount of the transaction; and at least one of the following dates: (1) The date of the transaction; (2) the date the transaction was debited to the consumer's account; or (3) if the consumer signed the credit document, the date appearing on the document. Existing comment 8(b)-1 provides that the term “nonsale credit” refers to any form of loan credit, including, for example: (1) A cash advance; (2) an advance on a credit plan that is accessed by overdrafts on a checking account; (3) the use of a “supplemental credit device” in the form of a check or draft or the use of the overdraft credit plan accessed by a debit card, even if such use is in connection with a purchase of goods or services; and (4) miscellaneous debits to remedy mispostings, returned checks, and similar entries.

      <analysisParagraph>The proposal would have added an additional example to existing comment 8(b)-1 to provide guidance on when credit transactions are “nonsale credit” when credit is accessed by a prepaid card that is a credit card. First, proposed comment 8(b)-1.v would have explained that “nonsale credit” includes an advance at an ATM on a credit plan that is accessed by a prepaid card that is a credit card. This proposed comment also would have clarified that if a prepaid card that is a credit card is used to obtain an advance at an ATM and the transaction is partially funded by the consumer's prepaid account and partially funded by a credit extension, the amount to be disclosed under proposed § 1026.8(b) is the amount of the credit extension, not the total amount of the ATM transaction.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The proposal also would have made technical revisions to two comments—existing comment 8(b)-1.ii and existing comment 8(b)-2—which would have provided guidance regarding overdraft credit plans in order to make clear that these comments do not apply to overdraft credit plans related to prepaid accounts.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive any specific comments on this aspect of the proposal. The Bureau is adopting new comment 8(b)-1.v as proposed, with revisions to be consistent with new § 1026.61.&lt;footnote ref="638"&gt;The proposal would have provided that the term “credit card” includes an account number that is not a prepaid card that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan that allows deposits directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. Proposed comment 8(b)-1.vi would have explained that “nonsale credit' includes an advance on a credit plan accessed by such an account number. For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) above, the final rule does not adopt the proposed comment 8(b)-1.vi related to these account numbers.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             New comment 8(b)-1.v provides that an advance at an ATM on a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in § 1026.61 is an example of nonsale credit under § 1026.8(b). This comment also provides that if a hybrid prepaid-credit card is used to obtain an advance at an ATM and the transaction is partially paid with funds from the asset feature of the prepaid account and partially paid with a credit extension from the covered separate credit feature, the amount to be disclosed under final § 1026.8(b) is the amount of the credit extension, not the total amount of the ATM transaction.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.8(a), the Bureau also is adding new comment 8(b)-1.vi to provide that a credit transaction will be disclosed as “nonsale credit” under final § 1026.8(b) on the Regulation Z periodic statement where a consumer uses a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61 to make a purchase to obtain goods or services from a merchant, and credit is transferred from a covered separate credit feature accessed by the hybrid prepaid-credit card into the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the amount of the purchase, as described in new comment 8(a)-9.ii.

The creditor may omit the address or provide any suitable designation that helps the consumer to identify the transaction when the transaction took place at a location that is not fixed; took place in the consumer's home; or was a mail, internet, or telephone order.

        <analysisParagraph>Existing comment 8(a)-2 provides guidance on how to disclose the amount of the credit transaction if sale transactions are not billed in full on any single statement. The proposal would have moved the existing language of comment 8(a)-2 to proposed comment 8(a)-2.i. The proposal also would have added comment 8(a)-2.ii to provide that the term “sale credit” includes a purchase in which the consumer uses a prepaid card that is a credit card to obtain goods or services from a merchant and the transaction is wholly or partially funded by credit, whether or not the merchant is the card issuer or creditor. Proposed comment 8(a)-2.ii also would have provided guidance on how to disclose the amount of the credit transaction for purposes of certain prepaid transactions. Proposed comment 8(a)-2.ii would have set forth guidance on how to disclose a transaction at point of sale where credit is accessed by a prepaid card that is a credit card, and that transaction partially involves the purchase of goods or services and partially involves other credit, such as cash back given to the cardholder. In this situation, proposed comment 8(a)-2.ii would have provided that the creditor must disclose the amount of credit as “sale credit” under existing § 1026.8(a), including the portion of the transaction that involves credit that is not for a purchase of goods or services.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 8(a)-2.ii also would have provided that if a prepaid card that is a credit card is used to obtain goods or services from a merchant and the transaction is partially funded by the consumer's prepaid account and partially funded by credit, the amount to be disclosed under existing § 1026.8(a) is the amount of the credit extension, not the total amount of the purchase transaction. For example, assume that a cardholder makes a $50 purchase with the prepaid card but only has $20 in funds in the prepaid account. The $30 of credit would have been disclosed on the Regulation Z periodic statement. Under the Regulation E proposal, the amount of the transaction that is funded from the prepaid account would have been disclosed either on the Regulation E periodic statement or on the electronic and written histories of account transactions pursuant to the periodic statement alternative set forth in proposed Regulation E § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii).</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau solicited comment on whether the Bureau should consider a disclosure that would appear on the Regulation Z periodic statement that would notify consumers when a particular transaction is funded partially through the prepaid account and partially funded through credit so that consumers would know to look at the Regulation E periodic statement or account history for additional information related to that transaction.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One consumer group commenter indicated that the Bureau should require that the entire transaction be disclosed on both the Regulation Z periodic statement and the Regulation E periodic statement under § 1005.9(b) (or on the electronic and written account transaction histories pursuant to the periodic statement alternative under proposed § 1005.18(c)(1)), indicating on each statement that only part of the transaction came from each account. This commenter believed that consumers who are trying to identify transactions would be confused if the amount listed on each statement does not match the transaction amount.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The final rule moves proposed comment 8(a)-2.ii to new comment 8(a)-9 and revises this guidance as discussed below. The Bureau also is revising existing comment 8(a)-1 to provide a cross-reference to new comment 8(a)-9 for guidance on when credit accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card from a covered separate credit feature must be disclosed on the Regulation Z periodic statement as sale credit or nonsale credit.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 8(a)-9 provides guidance on when credit accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card from a covered separate credit feature must be disclosed on the Regulation Z periodic statement as sale credit or nonsale credit. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 and a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 8(a)-9 recognizes that a card issuer with respect to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card may structure the overdraft credit feature in two ways to cover situations where the consumer has insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account at the time of authorization or settlement to cover the amount of the transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. With respect to the first way, new comment 8(a)-9.i explains that the covered separate credit feature could be structured such that a consumer can use a hybrid prepaid-credit card to make a purchase to obtain goods or services from a merchant, and credit is drawn directly from the covered separate credit feature without transferring funds into the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the amount of the purchase. For example, assume that the consumer has $10 of funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account and initiates a transaction with a merchant to obtain goods or services with the hybrid prepaid-credit card for $25. In this case, $10 is debited from the asset feature, and $15 of credit is drawn directly from the covered separate credit feature accessed by the hybrid prepaid-credit card without any transfer of funds into the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the amount of the purchase.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 8(a)-9.i provides that such a transaction is a “sale credit” under final § 1026.8(a). In this example, the $15 credit transaction will be treated as “sale credit” under final § 1026.8(a).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to the second way, new comment 8(a)-9.ii explains that a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card could be structured where a consumer uses a hybrid prepaid-credit card to make a purchase to obtain goods or services from a merchant, and credit is transferred from the covered separate credit feature into the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the amount of the purchase. For example, again, assume that the consumer has $10 of funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account and initiates a transaction with a merchant to obtain goods or services with the hybrid prepaid-credit card for $25. In this case, the $15 is transferred from the covered separate credit feature to the asset feature, and a transaction of $25 is debited from the asset feature of the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comments 8(a)-9.ii provides that such a transaction is a “nonsale credit” under final § 1026.8(b). In this example, the $15 credit transaction is treated as “nonsale credit” under § 1026.8(b). The Bureau notes, however, that while this type of credit transaction is disclosed as “nonsale credit” under final § 1026.8(b) on the Regulation Z periodic statement, this transaction is still considered a transaction made with the card to purchase goods or services under final § 1026.12(c) and would be subject to final § 1026.12(c). See the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.12(c) below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that for disclosure purposes under final §§ 1026.7(b)(2) and 1026.8, it is appropriate to distinguish these two ways in which a creditor may structure a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. The Bureau believes that this distinction will help consumers better recognize and understand the credit transactions when they are disclosed on the Regulation Z periodic statement. The Bureau believes that this is particularly true when a transaction involves situations where the hybrid prepaid-credit card is used to obtain goods or services from a merchant and the transaction is partially paid with funds from the asset feature of the consumer's prepaid account, and partially paid with credit from a covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, a credit transaction will be disclosed as “sale credit” on the Regulation Z periodic statement where a consumer uses a hybrid prepaid-credit card to make a purchase to obtain goods or services from a merchant, and credit is drawn directly from the covered separate credit feature to cover the amount of the purchase without transferring funds into the asset feature of the prepaid account. New comment 8(a)-9.iii provides for these types of transactions, if a hybrid prepaid-credit card is used to obtain goods or services from a merchant and the transaction is partially funded by the consumer's prepaid account and partially funded by credit from the covered separate credit feature, the amount to be disclosed under final § 1026.8(a) as a “sale credit' is the amount of the credit extension, not the total amount of the purchase transaction.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For example, again, assume that the consumer has $10 of funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account and initiates a transaction with a merchant to obtain goods or services with the hybrid prepaid-credit card for $25. In this case, $10 is debited from the asset feature, and $15 of credit is drawn directly from the covered separate credit feature to cover the amount of the purchase without any transfer of funds into the asset feature of the prepaid account. The $15 credit transaction is disclosed as “sale credit” on the Regulation Z periodic statement, and the $10 part of the transaction is disclosed on the Regulation E periodic statement under existing Regulation E § 1005.9(b), or alternatively, on the electronic and written account transaction histories pursuant to the periodic statement alternative under final Regulation E § 1005.18(c)(1).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In this example, because the credit transaction is treated as “sale credit” under existing § 1026.8(a), the following information regarding the credit portion of the transaction (the $15 credit portion, in the example above) generally will be disclosed on the Regulation Z periodic statement: (1) The amount of the transaction; (2) the date of the transaction; (3) the merchant's name; and (4) the merchant's location. In this example, as set forth in existing Regulation E § 1005.9(b)(1) and final § 1005.18(c)(3), similar information will be disclosed on the Regulation E periodic statement, or alternatively, the electronic and written account transaction histories regarding the portion of the transaction that involves asset funds ($10 in the above example), namely: (1) The amount of the transaction; (2) the date of the transaction; (3) the merchant's name; and (4) the merchant's location. The Bureau believes that because both parts of the transaction are disclosed consistently on the Regulation Z and Regulation E periodic statements (or on the electronic and written account transaction histories provided to consumers pursuant to the periodic statement alternative under final Regulation E § 1005.18(c)(1)), a consumer will be better able to match up the two parts of the transaction. Thus, the Bureau does not believe that it is necessary in this case to disclose both portions of the transaction on each periodic statement, as suggested by a consumer group commenter as discussed above.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau recognizes that for purchases of goods or services that involve overdrafts on asset accounts that are executed via debit cards, the credit transaction may be disclosed as nonsale credit. In particular, comment 8(b)-1.iii provides that nonsale credit includes the use of an overdraft credit plan accessed by a debit card, even if such use is in connection with a purchase of goods or services. In a 1981 rulemaking implementing the Truth in Lending Simplification and Reform Act, the Board indicated that several commenters requested clarification regarding whether a creditor should identify a transaction as sale or nonsale credit when a consumer uses a debit card with an overdraft feature to purchase goods, and in doing so, activates the overdraft. The Board expressed its belief that the credit portions of such transactions could be viewed as cash advances, and therefore permitted the credit portions to be disclosed as nonsale credit at the creditor's option even though a purchase is involved.&lt;footnote ref="637"&gt;46 FR 20848, 20861 (Apr. 7, 1981).&lt;/footnote&gt;
             As discussed in the &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z&lt;/em&gt; section, the Bureau is not intending to revise rules in Regulation Z that apply to overdraft plans accessed by debit cards. Nonetheless, for transactions discussed above with respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, the Bureau believes that disclosing the credit transaction as sale credit would be more helpful to consumers than disclosing the transaction as nonsale credit because consumers would receive the seller's name, and the city and State or foreign country where the transaction took place.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>If the credit transaction were treated as nonsale credit, the consumer would not receive the information about the seller's name and address. As discussed above, the Bureau believes that the information about the seller's name and address may be useful to consumers in identifying the credit transactions where a hybrid prepaid-credit card is used to obtain goods or services from a merchant, and credit is drawn directly from the covered separate credit feature to cover the amount of the purchase without transferring funds into the asset feature of the prepaid account. As discussed above, the Bureau also notes that under Regulation E, on the periodic statement, or the electronic and written account transaction histories under the periodic statement alternative, a transaction that involves a withdrawal from the prepaid account at point of sale must include the merchant's name and location. Thus, as discussed above, with respect to a single transaction that involves both a withdrawal from the prepaid account and an extension of credit, disclosing such a credit transaction as sale credit could help consumers match up the part of the transaction that appears on the Regulation Z periodic statement with the part of the transaction that appears on the Regulation E periodic statement or account transaction history.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>On the other hand, as set forth in new comments 8(a)-9.ii and 8(b)-1.vi a credit transaction is disclosed as “nonsale credit” under final § 1026.8(b) on the Regulation Z periodic statement where a consumer uses a hybrid prepaid-credit card to make a purchase to obtain goods or services from a merchant, and credit is transferred from the covered separate credit feature accessed by the hybrid prepaid-credit card into the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the amount of the purchase. For example, again assume that the consumer has $10 of funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account and initiates a transaction with a merchant to obtain goods or services with the hybrid prepaid-credit card for $25. In this case, $15 will be transferred from the covered separate credit feature to the asset feature, and a transaction of $25 is debited from the asset feature of the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In this example, the following information must be disclosed under § 1026.8(b) on the Regulation Z periodic statement with respect to the portion of the transaction that involves credit ($15 in this example): (1) A brief identification of the transaction; (2) the amount of the transaction; and (3) at least one of the following dates: The date of the transaction; the date the transaction was debited to the consumer's account; or if the consumer signed the credit document, the date appearing on the document.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Also, in this example, as set forth in existing Regulation E § 1005.9(b)(1) and final § 1005.18(c)(3), the following information will be given on the Regulation E periodic statement (or alternatively, the electronic and written account transaction histories) regarding the transfer of credit into the asset feature of the prepaid account (the $15 transfer from the covered separate credit feature): (1) The type of transfer and type of account from which funds were transferred; (2) the amount of the transfer; and (3) the date the transfer was credited to the consumer's account. In addition, as set forth in existing Regulation E § 1005.9(b)(1) and final § 1005.18(c)(3), the following information will be provided on the Regulation E periodic statement (or alternatively, the electronic and written account transaction histories) regarding the $25 debit to the asset feature: (1) The amount of the transaction; (2) the date of the transaction; and (3) the merchant's name and location.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that this information on the Regulation Z and E periodic statements (or alternatively, on the electronic and written account transaction histories pursuant to the periodic statement alternative under final Regulation E § 1005.18(c)(1)) will allow consumers to understand better the connection between outgoing transfers from covered separate credit features that are shown on the Regulation Z periodic statements and the incoming transfers that are shown on the Regulation E periodic statements (or alternatively, the electronic and written account transaction histories). The Regulation E periodic statement or account transaction histories also will show information about the purchase transaction made with the card. In the example above, the entire amount of the transaction ($25 purchase transaction) will be shown on the Regulation E periodic statement or the account transaction histories.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Transactions that partially involve the purchase of goods or services and partially involves other credit.&lt;/em&gt; New comment 8(a)-9.iii also provides that if a transaction is “sale credit” as described above, for a transaction at point of sale conducted using a hybrid prepaid-credit card that accesses credit from a covered separate credit feature where the transaction partially involves the purchase of goods or services and partially involves other credit, such as cash back given to the cardholder, the creditor must disclose the entire amount of the credit as sale credit, including the part of the transaction that does not relate to the purchase of goods or services.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau understands that creditors may not be able to identify separately the amount of the credit transaction that relates to the purchase of goods or services at a merchant and the amount of the credit transaction that relates to other types of credit, such as cash back given to the cardholder. In this case, the card issuer may only be able to determine the total amount of credit extended for that transaction. To ensure that consumers are better able to recognize credit transactions disclosed on periodic statements, new comment 8(a)-9.iii requires that a creditor disclose the entire amount of the credit transaction as “sale credit” under final § 1026.8(a). Under this approach, a creditor must disclose the entire amount of the credit transaction, the date of the transaction, and the merchant's name and location on the Regulation Z periodic statement. The Bureau believes such information is sufficient to allow a consumer to identify a transaction, even where part of the amount of the transaction is for cash back or other forms of credit given to the cardholder at point of sale. For these types of transactions, the Bureau anticipates that the cardholder will associate the entire credit transaction, including the cash back portion of the credit, with the merchant's name.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>4(b)(11)(ii)</title>
      <analysisParagraph>In contrast to the rule for fees imposed on a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, new § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) provides that any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account is a finance charge only to the extent that the amount of the fee or charge exceeds comparable fees or charges imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have a credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. Fees described in final § 1026.4(c) through (e), as applicable, are excluded from the definition of finance charge, although, as discussed in more detail below, the Bureau is narrowing certain of these existing exclusions as they are applied to credit offered in connection with prepaid accounts.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau's approach with regard to fees charged on an asset feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card is consistent with the comparable cash exception to the definition of finance charge. This approach is similar to the existing approach that Regulation Z takes outside the credit card context in exempting fees from the definition of finance charge if they are comparable to fees charged on a checking or other asset account for transactions that do not involve a credit feature as discussed in final § 1026.4(b)(2), although there are important distinctions as discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Compared to the proposed approach, the Bureau believes that the approach adopted in the final rule with respect to the asset feature will make it easier for both prepaid account issuers and for consumers to track and understand how the separate credit feature and asset features operate in connection with a hybrid prepaid-credit card. The Bureau is concerned that excluding all fees charged on an asset feature from the definition of finance charge would invite prepaid account issuers to structure their programs in ways that make it very difficult for consumers to analyze the true cost of credit on a hybrid prepaid-credit card. At the same time, the Bureau recognizes that certain fees charged in conjunction with the operation of the prepaid asset feature are not driven by credit use, and that it is useful to both prepaid account issuers and consumers to differentiate those fees from other charges. The Bureau believes that new § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) appropriately balances these considerations by providing that with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are finance charges only to the extent that the amount of the fee or charge exceeds comparable fees or charges imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comparable Fees</title>
        <analysisParagraph>While the Bureau's approach with regard to charges imposed on an asset feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card is somewhat similar to the rule provided in existing § 1026.4(b)(2) with regard to when transaction fees, service fees, and carrying fees imposed on checking and other transaction accounts are finance charges under Regulation Z, the final rule differs in one particularly important respect: It provides detailed guidance in new comment 4(b)(11)(ii)-1 regarding how fees on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature should be compared to fees imposed on prepaid accounts with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. This guidance is more detailed and more restrictive than the guidance provided under final § 1026.4(b)(2) with regard to checking and transaction accounts other than prepaid accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In developing these rules, as set forth in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i)(B) and new comment 61(a)(2)-4.ii, the Bureau was conscious that there were two potentially distinct types of credit extensions that could occur on a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. The first type of credit extension is where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. The second type of credit extension is where a consumer makes a standalone draw or transfer of credit from the covered separate credit feature, outside the course of any transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or service, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. For example, a consumer may use the prepaid card at the prepaid account issuer's Web site to load funds from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. Because the two scenarios involve different sets of activities, the range of fees triggered is also likely to be different. As discussed in more detail below, new comment 4(b)(11)(ii)-1 therefore provides separate guidance on the comparable fees under new § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) with respect to each of the two types of credit extensions.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 4(b)(11)(ii)-1.i explains that new comment 4(b)(11)(ii)-1.ii and iii provides guidance with respect to comparable fees under § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) for these two types of credit extensions on a covered separate credit feature. New comment 4(b)(11)(ii)-1.ii provides guidance for credit extensions where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from the covered separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. In addition, new comment 4(b)(11)(ii)-1.iii provides guidance for credit extensions where a consumer draws or transfers credit from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. New comment 4(b)(11)(ii)-1.ii and iii are discussed in more detail below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Credit extensions from the covered separate credit feature within the course of a transaction.&lt;/em&gt; New comment 4(b)(11)(ii)-1.ii provides guidance for credit extensions where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from the covered separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. Specifically, new comment 4(b)(11)(ii)-1.ii provides that where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from a covered separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing such a transaction, any per transaction fees imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account, including load and transfer fees, for such credit from the credit feature should be compared to the per transaction fees for each transaction to access funds in the asset feature of a prepaid account that is in the same prepaid account program but does not have such a credit feature. Thus, per transaction fees for a transaction that is conducted to load or draw funds into a prepaid account from some other source are not comparable for purposes of new § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>To illustrate these principles, new comment 4(b)(11)(ii)-1.ii sets forth several examples explaining when a finance charge is imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account in situations in which credit is accessed from a covered separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 4(b)(11)(ii)-1.ii.A provides the following example: Assume that a prepaid account issuer charges $0.50 on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature for each transaction that accesses funds in the asset feature of prepaid accounts. Also, assume that the prepaid account issuer charges $0.50 per transaction on the asset feature of prepaid accounts in the same prepaid program where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from a covered separate credit feature in the course of a transaction. In this case, the $0.50 per transaction fee imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature is not a finance charge because it is a comparable fee to the $0.50 per transaction fee imposed on the prepaid account without a covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Nonetheless, as described in new comment 4(b)(11)(ii)-1.ii.B, in this example, if the prepaid account issuer instead charged $1.25 on the asset feature of a prepaid account for each transaction where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from the covered separate credit feature in the course of the transaction, the additional $0.75 is a finance charge.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As another example set forth in new comment 4(b)(11)(ii)-1.ii.C, assume a prepaid account issuer charges $0.50 on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature for each transaction that accesses funds in the asset feature of prepaid accounts. Assume also that the prepaid account issuer charges both a $0.50 per transaction fee and a $1.25 transfer fee on the asset feature of prepaid accounts in the same prepaid program where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from a covered separate credit feature in the course of a transaction. In this case, both fees charged on a per-transaction basis for the credit transaction (&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;i.e.,&lt;/em&gt; a combined fee of $1.75 per transaction) must be compared to the $0.50 per transaction fee to access funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account without a covered separate credit feature. Accordingly, the $1.25 excess is a finance charge.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 4(b)(11)(ii)-1.ii.D provides another example. Under this example, assume a prepaid account issuer charges both a $0.50 fee for each transaction that accesses funds in the asset feature of prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature, and charges a load fee of $1.25 whenever funds are transferred or loaded from a separate asset account, such as from a deposit account via a debit card, in the course of a transaction on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature. Assume also that the prepaid account issuer charges both a $0.50 per transaction fee and a $1.25 transfer fee on the asset feature of prepaid accounts in the same prepaid program when the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from a covered separate credit feature in the course of a transaction. In this case, both fees charged on a per-transaction basis for the credit transaction (&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;i.e.,&lt;/em&gt; a combined fee of $1.75 per transaction) must be compared to the $0.50 per transaction fee to access funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account without a covered separate credit feature. Per transaction fees for a transaction that is conducted to load or draw funds into a prepaid account from some other source (in this example, the $1.25 fee to load funds from another asset account) are not comparable for purposes of new § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii). Accordingly, the $1.25 excess is a finance charge.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also notes that the per transaction fee for a credit extension in the course of a transaction from a covered separate credit feature cannot be compared to a fee for declining to pay a transaction that is imposed on a prepaid account without such a credit feature in the same prepaid account program.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that the above standard for determining comparable fees with respect to fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of prepaid accounts accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards will help prevent evasion of the rules set forth in the final rule with respect to hybrid prepaid-credit cards. The Bureau believes that many prepaid cardholders who wish to use covered separate credit features may not have other deposit accounts or savings accounts from which they can transfer funds to prevent an overdraft on the prepaid account in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. As a result, the Bureau does not believe that a per transaction fee for credit drawn or transferred from a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card during the course of a transaction should be allowed to be compared with a per transaction fee for a service that many prepaid cardholders who wish to use covered separate credit features may not be able to use.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is concerned that if it permitted such a comparison, card issuers could charge a substantial fee to transfer funds from the checking account or savings account during the course of a transaction using the prepaid account (which many prepaid cardholders who wish to use covered separate credit features may not be able to use as a practical matter) and then charge that same substantial per transactions fees for credit drawn or transferred from the covered separate credit feature during the course of a transaction without such fees being considered a finance charge. This could allow the prepaid account issuer to avoid charging a finance charge and avoid the application of the Credit CARD Act provisions that are generally set forth in subpart G, such as the restriction on fees set forth in § 1026.52. For this reason, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to limit the comparable fee in this case to per transaction fees imposed on prepaid accounts for transactions that access funds in the prepaid account in the same prepaid account program that does not have a covered separate credit feature. All prepaid accountholders can use prepaid accounts to make transactions that access available funds in the prepaid account, so these types of transactions will be available to all prepaid accountholders.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Credit extensions from a covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction.&lt;/em&gt; New comment 4(b)(11)(ii)-1.iii provides guidance for credit extensions where a consumer draws or transfers credit from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or service, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers, as discussed above.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 4(b)(11)(ii)-1.iii provides that load or transfer fees imposed for draws or transfers of credit from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction are compared only with fees, if any, to load funds as a direct deposit of salary from an employer or a direct deposit of government benefits that are charged on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature. Fees imposed on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature for a one-time load or transfer of funds from a separate asset account or from a non-covered separate credit feature are not comparable for purposes of new § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 4(b)(11)(ii)-1.iii provides examples to illustrate this guidance. New comment 4(b)(11)(ii)-1.iii.A provides the following example: Assume a prepaid account issuer charges a $1.25 load fee to transfer funds from a non-covered separate credit feature, such as a non-covered separate credit card account, into prepaid accounts that do not have a covered separate credit feature and does not charge a fee for a direct deposit of salary from an employer or a direct deposit of government benefits on those prepaid accounts. Assume the prepaid account issuer charges $1.25 on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature to load funds from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction. In this case, the $1.25 fee imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature is a finance charge because no fee is charged for a direct deposit of salary from an employer or a direct deposit of government benefits on prepaid accounts without such a credit feature. Fees imposed on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature for a one-time load or transfer of funds from a non-covered separate credit feature (in this example, the $1.25 fee to load funds from the non-covered separate credit feature) are not comparable for purposes of new § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In a second example described in new comment 4(b)(11)(ii)-1.iii.B, assume that a prepaid account issuer charges a $1.25 load fee for a one-time transfer of funds from a separate asset account, such as from a deposit account via a debit card, to a prepaid account without a covered separate credit feature and does not charge a fee for a direct deposit of salary from an employer or a direct deposit of government benefits on those prepaid accounts. Assume the prepaid account issuer charges $1.25 on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature to load funds from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction. In this case, the $1.25 fee imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature is a finance charge because no fee is charged for a direct deposit of salary from an employer or a direct deposit of government benefits on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature. Fees imposed on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature for a one-time load or transfer of funds from a separate asset account (in this example, the $1.25 fee to load funds form the separate asset account) are not comparable for purposes of new § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As an initial matter, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to compare fees imposed to load or transfer credit from a covered separate credit feature outside the course of transactions conducted with the card to fees, if any, for a direct deposit of salary from an employer or a direct deposit of government benefits on prepaid accounts with no covered separate credit feature because those direct deposits also occur outside the course of transactions conducted with the card that access funds in the prepaid account. Thus, the Bureau believes that these two types of situations are comparable because they both occur outside the course of transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or service, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau recognizes that there may be other types of loads or transfers of asset funds or credit that can occur outside the course of a transaction, including loads or transfers of funds from other asset accounts, such as checking accounts or savings accounts, or loads or transfers of credit from other credit accounts that are not covered separate credit features. Nonetheless, the Bureau believes that many prepaid accountholders who wish to use covered separate credit features may not have other asset accounts, such as checking accounts or savings accounts, or other credit accounts, from which they can draw or transfer asset funds or credit for deposit into the prepaid account outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or service, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. As a result, the Bureau does not believe that load or transfer fees for credit from a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card outside the course of a transaction should be allowed to be compared with a load or transfer fees from an asset account, or non-covered separate credit feature, outside the course of a transaction.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is concerned that if it did so, card issuers could charge a substantial fee to load or transfer funds from the checking account or savings account or a non-covered separate credit feature (which many prepaid cardholders who wish to use covered separate credit features may not be able to use as a practical matter) and then charge that same substantial fee for load or transfer fees for credit loaded or transferred from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction without that fee being a finance charge. This could allow the prepaid account issuer to avoid charging a finance charge and avoid the application of the Credit CARD Act provisions that are generally set forth in subpart G, such as the restriction on fees set forth in § 1026.52. For this reason, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to limit the comparable fee in this case to fees, if any, to load funds as a direct deposit of salary from an employer or a direct deposit of government benefits that are charged on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature. The Bureau believes that such direct deposit methods commonly are offered on most types of prepaid accounts and that most prepaid accountholders who wish to use covered separate credit features are able to avail themselves of these methods.&lt;footnote ref="621"&gt;The Bureau understands that prepaid account issuers currently offering overdraft services condition consumer eligibility on receipt of a regularly-occurring direct deposit in excess of a specified threshold.&lt;/footnote&gt;

      <title>4(a) Definition</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Under Regulation Z, the term “finance charge” generally is defined in existing § 1026.4(a) to mean “the cost of consumer credit as a dollar amount.” It includes any charge payable directly or indirectly by the consumer and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to or as a condition of the extension of credit. It does not include any charge of a type payable in a comparable cash transaction.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>With regard to credit card accounts, generally all transaction fees imposed on the account are treated as finance charges, even if the creditor imposes comparable transaction fees on asset accounts. Existing comment 4(a)-4 provides guidance on when transaction charges imposed on credit card accounts are finance charges under existing § 1026.4(a). (Transaction charges that are imposed on checking accounts or other transaction accounts are discussed in the section-by-section analyses of § 1026.4(b) and (b)(11) below.) Specifically, existing comment 4(a)-4 provides that any transaction charge imposed on a cardholder by a card issuer is a finance charge, regardless of whether the issuer imposes the same, greater, or lesser charge on withdrawals of funds from an asset account such as a checking or savings account. For example, any charge imposed on a credit cardholder by a card issuer for the use of an ATM to obtain a cash advance (whether in a proprietary, shared, interchange, or other system) is a finance charge, regardless of whether the card issuer imposes a charge on its debit cardholders for using the ATM to withdraw cash from a consumer asset account, such as a checking or savings account. In addition, any charge imposed on a credit cardholder for making a purchase or obtaining a cash advance outside the United States with a foreign merchant, or in a foreign currency, is a finance charge, regardless of whether a charge is imposed on debit cardholders for such transactions. This comment essentially provides that debit card transactions are not considered “comparable cash transactions” to credit card transactions with respect to transaction charges imposed by a card issuer on a credit cardholder when those fees are imposed on the credit card account.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The proposal would have added proposed comment 4(a)-4.iii to provide that any transaction charge imposed on a cardholder by a card issuer for credit accessed by a prepaid card is a finance charge regardless of whether the card issuer imposes the same, greater, or lesser charge on the withdrawal of funds from a prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau received substantial comment on the circumstances in which fees imposed on a prepaid account should be considered finance charges under § 1026.4. These comments are discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.4(b)(11) below. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.4(b)(11), new § 1026.4(b)(11) and related commentary set forth guidance regarding the circumstances in which a fee is a finance charge for credit offered in connection with a prepaid account. Thus, the Bureau is not revising existing comment 4(a)-4 to include the proposed prepaid card example discussed above.&lt;footnote ref="616"&gt;The proposal would have provided that the term “credit card” includes an account number that is not a prepaid card that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan that allows deposits directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. Proposed comment 4(a)-4 would have been revised to provide that any transaction charge imposed on a cardholder by a card issuer for credit accessed by such an account number is a finance charge regardless of whether the card issuer imposes the same, greater, or lesser charge on the withdrawal of funds from a prepaid account. For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) above, the final rule does not adopt the proposed changes to comment 4(a)-4 related to these account numbers.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             Instead, the final rule revises existing comment 4(a)-4 to provide that comment does not apply to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61. The comment also is revised to cross-reference new §§ 1026.4(b)(11) and 1026.61 for guidance on the circumstances in which a fee is a finance charge in connection with a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>4(b)(11)(i)</title>
      <analysisParagraph>New § 1026.4(b)(11)(i) provides that with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, as defined in new § 1026.61, any fee or charge described in final § 1026.4(b)(1) through (10) imposed on the covered separate credit feature is a finance charge, regardless of whether the separate credit feature is structured as a credit subaccount of the prepaid account or a separate credit account. Fees would be excluded from the definition of finance charge if they are described in final § 1026.4(c) through (e), as applicable, although as discussed in more detail below, the Bureau is narrowing certain of these existing exclusions as they are applied to credit in connection with prepaid accounts. This approach is similar to the approach to the definition of “finance charge” that currently applies to credit card accounts generally, except the Bureau is narrowing certain exclusions contained in § 1026.4(c)(3) and (4) as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.4(c) below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Comment 4(b)(11)(i)-1 provides further guidance on this framework. Specifically, it provides that any transaction charge imposed on a cardholder by a card issuer on a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card is a finance charge. This comment also provides that transaction charges that are imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account are subject to new § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) and related commentary, instead of new § 1026.4(b)(11)(i).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 4(b)(11)(i)-1 also clarifies that the treatment of transaction fees on the separate covered credit feature is consistent with the treatment of transaction fees on a credit card account, as specified in existing comment 4(a)-4. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.4(a) above, existing comment 4(a)-4 provides guidance on when transaction charges imposed on credit card accounts are finance charges under § 1026.4(a).&lt;footnote ref="619"&gt;Transaction charges that are imposed on checking accounts or other transaction accounts (other than prepaid accounts) are discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.4(b) above, and transaction charges imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card are discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) below.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             Specifically, existing comment 4(a)-4 provides that any transaction charge imposed on a cardholder by a card issuer is a finance charge, regardless of whether the issuer imposes the same, greater, or lesser charge on withdrawals of funds from an asset account, such as a checking or savings account. For example, any charge imposed on a credit cardholder by a card issuer for the use of an ATM to obtain a cash advance (whether in a proprietary, shared, interchange, or other system) is a finance charge regardless of whether the card issuer imposes a charge on its debit cardholders for using the ATM to withdraw cash from a consumer asset account, such as a checking or savings account. In addition, any charge imposed on a credit cardholder for making a purchase or obtaining a cash advance outside the United States with a foreign merchant, or in a foreign currency, is a finance charge, regardless of whether a charge is imposed on debit cardholders for such transactions. This comment essentially provides that debit card transactions are not considered “comparable cash transactions” to credit card transactions with respect to transaction charges imposed by a card issuer on a credit cardholder when those fees are imposed on the credit card account.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In the supplemental information accompanying the rule that adopted this comment, the Board noted the inherent complexity of distinguishing transactions that are “comparable cash transactions” to credit card transactions from transactions that are not.&lt;footnote ref="620"&gt;74 FR 5244, 5263 (Jan. 29, 2009).&lt;/footnote&gt;

             For example, the Board discussed the case where a card issuer imposes a transaction fee on the credit card account for a cash advance obtained through an ATM. The Board found that a transaction fee for a cash advance obtained through an ATM would not always be a finance charge if fees that are imposed on debit cards offered by the credit card issuer were considered in applying the “comparable cash transaction” exception. In particular, whether the transaction fee for the cash advance is a finance charge would depend on whether the credit card issuer provided asset accounts and offered debit cards on those accounts and whether the fee exceeds the fee imposed for a cash advance transaction through an ATM on such asset accounts. The Board believed this type of distinction was not helpful for consumers in understanding transaction fees imposed on their credit card accounts. Thus, the Board adopted existing comment 4(a)-4, which provides that any transaction charge imposed on a cardholder by a card issuer is a finance charge, regardless of whether the issuer imposes the same, greater, or lesser charge on withdrawals of funds from an asset account, such as a checking or savings account. The Board noted that it was not revising existing comment 4(b)(2)-1, which states that if a checking or transaction account charge imposed on an account with a credit feature does not exceed the charge for an account without a credit feature, the charge is not a finance charge. The Board further noted that existing comment 4(b)(2)-1 addresses situations distinct from those addressed by comment 4(a)-4.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>With respect to whether a per transaction charge imposed on the covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card should be a finance charge, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to follow the same rules that generally apply to credit cards, as set forth in existing comment 4(a)-4. Thus, consistent with existing comment 4(a)-4, any transaction charge imposed on a cardholder by a card issuer on a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card is a finance charge. With regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, transaction charges that are imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account are subject to new § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) and related commentary, instead of new § 1026.4(b)(11)(i).</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Overview of Final Changes to Definitions</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z&lt;/em&gt; section above and in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61 below, the Bureau is adopting a new definition of “hybrid prepaid-credit card” in new § 1026.61 &lt;footnote ref="593"&gt;Throughout the section-by-section analyses of Regulations E and Z, the term “hybrid prepaid-credit card” refers to a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             to describe the circumstances in which the Bureau has decided to regulate prepaid cards &lt;footnote ref="594"&gt;New § 1026.61(a)(5)(vii) defines “prepaid card” to mean “any card, code, or other device that can be used to access a prepaid account.” The term “prepaid card” includes a prepaid account number. &amp;lt;em data-original="E-03"&amp;gt;See&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; new comment 61(a)(5)(vii)-1. Consistent with final Regulation E, new § 1026.61(a)(5)(v) defines &amp;amp;#8220;prepaid account&amp;amp;#8221; to mean &amp;amp;#8220;a prepaid account as defined in Regulation E, 12 CFR 1005.2(b)(3).&amp;amp;#8221;&lt;/footnote&gt;

             as credit cards under Regulation Z when they can access credit offered in connection with a prepaid account. The Bureau also has decided to exclude prepaid cards from being covered as credit cards under Regulation Z when they access certain specified types of credit. A number of supporting definitions that help to distinguish hybrid prepaid-credit cards from prepaid cards that are not credit cards under Regulation Z are provided in new § 1026.61 as described further below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is making conforming changes to general Regulation Z definitions in both existing §§ 1026.2 and 1026.4 to effectuate and reflect these distinctions. For example, the Bureau is making amendments to the definition of “credit card” in existing § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) and related commentary to make clear that the term “credit card” includes a hybrid prepaid-credit card. The Bureau also is making several amendments to the commentary relating to several other terms that are defined in existing § 1026.2 that pertain to the general regulation of credit and credit cards under Regulation Z. Specifically, the Bureau is amending the commentary regarding such terms as “card issuer” in existing § 1026.2(a)(7), “open-end credit” in existing § 1026.2(a)(20), and “credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan” in existing § 1026.2(a)(15)(ii). Finally, the Bureau also is amending the definition of “finance charge” in existing § 1026.4 and related commentary with respect to credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards and with respect to other credit features that are accessible by prepaid cards that are not credit cards under Regulation Z. These changes are briefly summarized below before the more detailed discussion of specific amendments to specific subparagraphs of existing §§ 1026.2 and 1026.4, and their related commentary.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Definition of “credit card.”&lt;/em&gt; Regulation Z defines the term “credit card” in current § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) to mean “any card, plate, or other single credit device that may be used from time to time to obtain credit.” As discussed below, the Bureau is adopting a new definition of “hybrid prepaid-credit card” in new § 1026.61 which sets forth the circumstances in which a prepaid card is a credit card under Regulation Z. Accordingly, the Bureau is amending the general definition of “credit card” in existing § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) to state expressly that a prepaid card that is a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61 is a credit card under Regulation Z. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See also&lt;/em&gt; new § 1026.61(a)(1) and new comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.F. As described in new § 1026.61(a)(1), a prepaid card that is not a “hybrid prepaid-credit card” is not a credit card for purposes of Regulation Z. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See also&lt;/em&gt; new comment 2(a)(15)-2.ii.D.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>More specifically, as discussed in the &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z&lt;/em&gt; section above and in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61 below, the Bureau generally intends to cover under Regulation Z overdraft credit features in connection with prepaid accounts where the credit features are offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliates, or its business partners. New § 1026.61(b) generally requires that such credit features be structured as separate subaccounts or accounts, distinct from the prepaid asset account, to facilitate transparency and compliance with various Regulation Z requirements. New § 1026.61(a)(2)(i) provides that a prepaid card is a “hybrid prepaid-credit card” with respect to a separate credit feature if the card meets the following two conditions: (1) The card can be used from time to time to access credit from the separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; and (2) the separate credit feature is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. New § 1026.61(a)(2)(i) defines such a separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as a “covered separate credit feature.” Thus, the hybrid prepaid-credit card can access both the covered separate credit feature and the asset feature of the prepaid account, and the hybrid prepaid-credit card is a credit card under Regulation Z with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61 below, the Bureau also has decided to exclude prepaid cards from being covered as credit cards under Regulation Z when they access certain specified types of credit. First, new § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii) provides that a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a separate credit feature that does not meet both of the conditions above, for example, where the credit feature is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate or its business partner. Such credit features are defined as “non-covered separate credit features,” as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2). Second, under new § 1026.61(a)(4), a prepaid card also is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card when the prepaid card accesses incidental credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account where the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit.&lt;footnote ref="595"&gt;Throughout the section-by-section analyses of Regulations E and Z, the term “incidental credit” is used to refer to credit that meets the conditions of new § 1026.61(a)(4).&lt;/footnote&gt;
             A prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 or a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) when it accesses credit from these types of credit features. For more detailed explanations of when prepaid cards are not credit cards under Regulation Z, see the section-by-section analyses of § 1026.61(a)(2) and (4).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Definition of “card issuer.”&lt;/em&gt; The term “card issuer” is generally defined in existing § 1026.2(a)(7) to mean “a person that issues a credit card or that person's agent with respect to the card.” Under the general rules applicable to credit cards, card issuers are subject to certain direct regulation in their own right, and a card issuer that extends credit is a creditor under Regulation Z even if it does not meet the general definition of “creditor” under existing § 1026.2(a)(17)(i). Because under the final rule a hybrid prepaid-credit card is a credit card under Regulation Z, a prepaid account issuer is a “card issuer” under existing § 1026.2(a)(7) when it issues a hybrid prepaid-credit card. In addition, to further apply these concepts in the prepaid context, the Bureau is amending the commentary to existing § 1026.2(a)(7) to reflect that with respect to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61, an affiliate or business partner offering the credit feature (if applicable) also is a “card issuer” under Regulation Z. Accordingly, under existing § 1026.2(a)(17)(iii) and (iv), the person offering the covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card (whether that person is a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner) also is a creditor under Regulation Z.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Definition of “open-end credit” and “credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan.”&lt;/em&gt; As discussed further below, certain credit card rules only apply to credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan as defined in existing § 1026.2(a)(15)(ii). This definition in turn hinges largely on whether a credit card can access “open-end credit” as defined in existing § 1026.2(a)(20). The term “open-end credit” is defined to mean consumer “credit” extended by a “creditor” under a “plan” in which (1) the creditor reasonably contemplates repeated transactions; (2) the creditor may impose a “finance charge” from time to time on an outstanding unpaid balance; and (3) the amount of credit that may be extended to the consumer during the term of the plan (up to any limit set by the creditor) is generally made available to the extent that any outstanding balance is repaid.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card generally will meet the definition of “open-end credit,” and is amending the regulation text and commentary to facilitate the classification of a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as “open-end credit” and a “credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan.” A person that is offering a covered separate credit feature involving open-end (not home-secured) credit that is accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card will be subject to Regulation Z's open-end (not home-secured) rules and credit card rules in subparts B and G.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The open-end (not home-secured) rules in subpart B include account-opening disclosures, periodic statement disclosures, change-in-terms notices, provisions on promptly crediting payments, and billing error resolution procedures. The credit card rules in subpart B include provisions that restrict the unsolicited issuance of credit cards, limit the liability for unauthorized use of credit cards, and prohibit the offset of the credit card debt against funds held in asset accounts by the card issuer. The credit card rules in subpart G include provisions that prohibit credit card issuers from extending credit without assessing the consumer's ability to pay and restrict the amount of required fees that an issuer can charge during the first year after a credit card account is opened. Application of the particular rules is discussed further below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Definition of finance charge.&lt;/em&gt; As discussed above, whether a creditor may impose a finance charge from time to time on an outstanding balance is one of the elements that helps determine coverage as open-end credit. As discussed above, certain credit card rules apply only to open-end credit that is accessible by a credit card. The term “finance charge” generally is defined in existing § 1026.4(a) to mean “the cost of consumer credit as a dollar amount.” It includes any charge payable directly or indirectly by the consumer and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to or as a condition of the extension of credit. It generally does not include any charges of a type payable in a comparable cash transaction. Currently, certain fees or charges are specifically excluded from the term “finance charge” as part of the exclusion for overdraft services on checking accounts as discussed in the &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z&lt;/em&gt; section above. For example, existing § 1026.4(c)(3) excludes charges imposed by a financial institution for paying items that overdraw an account, unless the payment of such items and the imposition of the charge were previously agreed upon in writing. In addition, existing § 1026.4(c)(4) excludes fees charged for participation in a credit plan, whether assessed on an annual or other periodic basis.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is amending existing § 1026.4 and its commentary to provide that the exclusion in existing § 1026.4(c)(3) does not apply to credit offered in connection with a prepaid account as defined in new § 1026.61 and that the exclusion in existing § 1026.4(c)(4) does not apply to a fee to participate in a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61, regardless of whether this fee is imposed on the credit feature or on the asset feature of the prepaid account. As discussed further below, these amendments help to effectuate application of certain credit card rules to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards and to better reflect the full cost of credit. In addition, the Bureau is adding new provisions to final § 1026.4 and its commentary to provide additional clarification and guidance as to what types of fees and charges constitute “finance charges” related to credit offered in connection with a prepaid account. All of these changes are discussed in more detail below in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.4.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>61(a) Hybrid Prepaid-Credit Card</title>
      <analysisParagraph>TILA section 103(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;l&lt;/em&gt;) defines the term “credit card” to mean any card, plate, coupon book, or other credit device existing for the purpose of obtaining money, property, labor, or services on credit.&lt;footnote ref="696"&gt;15 U.S.C. 1602(&amp;lt;em data-original="E-03"&amp;gt;l&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;).&lt;/footnote&gt;
             Under Regulation Z, the term “credit card” is defined in existing § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) to mean “any card, plate, or other single credit device that may be used from time to time to obtain credit.”</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The proposal would have provided guidance on when the following devices related to prepaid accounts are “credit cards”: (1) Prepaid cards, as defined in proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(v) to mean any card, code, or other device that can be used to access a “prepaid account” as defined in proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(vi) consistent with proposed Regulation E; and (2) account numbers that are not prepaid cards that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan that allows deposits directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor but does not allow consumers to deposit directly extensions of credit from the plan into asset accounts other than particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor, as defined in proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(vii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Prepaid cards.&lt;/em&gt; The proposal would have covered a broad range of credit plans as credit card accounts under Regulation Z when they were accessed by a prepaid card. First, under the proposal, credit plans, including overdraft services and overdraft lines of credit, directly accessed by prepaid cards generally would have been credit card accounts under Regulation Z. Under the proposal, this would have applied where credit is “pulled” by a prepaid card, such as when the consumer uses the prepaid card at point of sale to access an overdraft plan to fund a purchase. In particular, proposed comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.F would have provided that the term “credit card” generally includes a prepaid card that is a single device that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The proposal intended broadly to capture a prepaid card as a credit card when it directly accessed a credit plan, regardless of whether that credit plan was structured as a separate credit plan or as negative balance to the prepaid account. The Bureau recognized that under the proposal, credit would have included: (1) Transactions that are authorized where the consumer has insufficient or unavailable funds in the prepaid account at the time of authorization; and (2) transactions on a prepaid account where the consumer has insufficient or unavailable funds in the prepaid account at the time the transaction is paid. Such transactions would have been credit accessed by a prepaid card that is a credit card under the proposal regardless of whether the person established a separate credit account to extend the credit or whether the credit was simply reflected as a negative balance on the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The proposal would not have applied the credit card rules in situations in which a prepaid card only assessed credit that is not subject to any finance charge, as defined in § 1026.4, or fee described in § 1026.4(c), and was not payable by written agreement in more than four installments. Specifically, the proposal provided that the prepaid card in such situations would not have been a credit card. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.4 above, the proposal also included revisions to the definition of “finance charge” in § 1026.4(a) and (b)(2) and their related commentary to delineate when a fee imposed in relation to credit accessed by a prepaid card that is a credit card would have been a finance charge under § 1026.4. In general, the proposal would have treated any transaction charges imposed on a cardholder by a card issuer on a prepaid account in connection with credit accessed by a prepaid card as a finance charge, regardless of how the amount of the fees compared to fees the issuer charged on non-credit transactions or accounts that did not involve credit access. The Bureau recognized that, under the proposal, if a prepaid account issuer would have imposed a per transaction fee on a prepaid account for any transactions authorized or settled on the prepaid account, the prepaid account issuer would have needed to waive that per transaction fee imposed on the prepaid account when the transaction accessed credit in order to take advantage of the proposed exception for when a prepaid card would not be a credit card under the proposal.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Account numbers that are not prepaid cards.&lt;/em&gt; As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) above, proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(vii) would have included within the definition of credit card “an account number where extensions of credit are permitted to be deposited directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor.” As used in the proposal, this term would have meant an account number that was not a prepaid card that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan that allowed deposits directly into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor but did not allow the consumer to deposit directly extensions of credit from the plan into asset accounts other than particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. Proposed comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.G would have provided that these account numbers were credit cards under the proposal.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>This proposal language would have covered credit plans that are not accessed directly by prepaid cards but instead are structured as “push” accounts. Under such a credit plan, a person would provide credit accessed by an account number where such extensions of credit may only be deposited directly into particular prepaid accounts specified by the person and cannot be deposited directly into another asset account, such as a deposit account. For example, such a credit plan may allow a consumer to use an account number to request that an extension of credit be deposited directly into a particular prepaid account specified by the creditor when the consumer does not have adequate funds in the prepaid account to cover the full amount of a transaction using the prepaid card. In the proposal, the Bureau expressed concern that these types of credit plans could act as substitutes for credit plans directly accessed by a prepaid card. The Bureau did not, however, propose to cover general purpose lines of credit where a consumer has the freedom to choose where to deposit directly the credit funds.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received on Prepaid Cards Accessing Credit From Separate Credit Features</title>
        <analysisParagraph>In response to the proposal, several commenters expressed concern about the way the proposal would have applied the credit card rules to credit products that were structured as standalone plans or products, rather than as negative balances on the prepaid account. An issuing credit union requested clarification that the proposal would have applied the credit card rules to situations in which a prepaid card could be used to initiate the load or transfer of credit to a prepaid account, but this load or transfer could not occur in course of processing transactions conducted with the card when there were insufficient funds in the prepaid account to cover the amount of the transaction. This commenter noted that consumers can consciously load value to their prepaid account using their debit card or credit card, where this load is not occurring as part of an overdraft feature in connection with the prepaid account. When using the debit card, the consumer may consciously load funds from an overdraft or line of credit product that is linked to a traditional checking account. When using a credit card, the consumer is loading credit from an available credit card balance to fund the prepaid account. This commenter urged the Bureau to clarify that such loads do not make the prepaid card into a credit card under Regulation Z.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>On the other hand, as discussed above, several consumer group commenters suggested that the credit card rules should apply to a credit account even if the credit account did not function as an overdraft credit feature with respect to a prepaid account, so long as credit from the credit account was deposited into the prepaid account. These commenters urged the Bureau to apply the credit card rules to all credit transferred to a prepaid account, even if there is another way to access the credit.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Another consumer group commenter suggested that the Bureau should apply the credit card rules to all open-end lines of credit where credit is deposited or transferred to prepaid accounts if either (1) the creditor is the same institution as or has a business relationship with the prepaid issuer; or (2) the creditor reasonably anticipates that a prepaid card will be used as an access device for the line of credit. Nonetheless, this commenter said that the final rule should not impact a completely unrelated credit account that has no connection to prepaid issuers or consumers identified as prepaid card users, even though the creditor allows credit to be transferred from the credit account through the ACH system.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Two industry trade associations said the Bureau should not consider a prepaid card to be a credit card with respect to a separate credit feature when the credit feature is offered by an unrelated third party rather than the prepaid account issuer or an associated company. These commenters indicated that such unrelated third-party creditors are not in a position to know that they have additional obligations under Regulation Z at the point in time that a prepaid account issuer or a consumer chooses to use a credit feature offered by the unrelated third-party creditor as a form of overdraft credit feature in relation to a prepaid account. Several other commenters, including an industry trade association, a program manager, and several issuing banks, requested clarification that a prepaid card would not be a credit card under the proposal where it accesses credit deposited into the prepaid account from a separate credit feature offered by an unrelated third-party creditor. These commenters argued that prepaid account issuer may not know that the deposited funds are credit.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>On the other hand, several consumer groups supported the proposed rule's approach in considering a third party that offers an open-end credit feature accessed by a prepaid card to be an agent of the prepaid account issuer and thus a credit card issuer with responsibilities under Regulation Z. They believed the proposed rule would deter evasion by third-party creditors that allow their credit features to be used as an overdraft credit feature accessed by prepaid cards.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received on Prepaid Cards Accessing Credit Through a Negative Balance on the Asset Feature of a Prepaid Account</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also received comments on the proposal regarding when a prepaid card is a credit card when it accesses credit extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account. As discussed above, the proposal would have provided that a prepaid card would not have been a credit card under existing § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) if the prepaid card only accesses credit that is not subject to any finance charge, as defined in § 1026.4, or fee described in § 1026.4(c), and is not payable by written agreement in more than four installments.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters argued that the Bureau should not regulate overdraft credit features in connection with prepaid accounts under Regulation Z except where there is an agreement to extend credit, consistent with how overdraft credit is treated currently with respect to checking accounts. These commenters said that the Bureau should instead subject overdraft credit programs where there is not an agreement to the opt-in regime in Regulation E § 1005.17, which currently applies to overdraft services provided for ATM and one-time debit card transactions. Several commenters, including industry trade associations, a credit union service organization, a credit reporting agency, and a program manager, also asserted that overdraft credit does not meet the definition of “credit” under TILA because with respect to overdraft credit, there is no right to defer payment and/or no right to incur debt. These comments are discussed in more detail in the &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z&lt;/em&gt; section and in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(14) above.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In commenting on the specifics of the Regulation Z proposal, many industry commenters were concerned that because of the breadth of the fees that would be considered finance charges under the proposal, a prepaid account issuer either could not charge general transactional fees on the prepaid account or would have to waive certain fees on any transaction that happened to have involved credit, as defined under the proposal, in order to avoid triggering the credit card rules.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For example, one payment network indicated that a prepaid card should not be a credit card when it accesses credit extended through a negative balance on the asset balance of the prepaid account if the &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; fees charged on the prepaid account in connection with the extension of credit are the &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;very same&lt;/em&gt; fees that would apply to the same transaction on the prepaid card without an extension of credit. Similarly, two industry trade associations urged that a prepaid card should be a credit card when it accesses credit extended through a negative balance on the asset balance of the prepaid account only if the prepaid account issuer charges fees directly correlated with the overdraft in question. These commenters argued that a prepaid card should not be a credit card when it accesses credit extended through a negative balance on the asset balance of the prepaid account if the prepaid account issuer only imposes on the prepaid account fees or charges that are wholly unrelated to an overdraft, such as a fee to make a balance inquiry at an ATM. These commenters also indicated that a prepaid card should not be a credit card when the prepaid account issuer only imposes unrelated fees or charges on the prepaid account, even when these unrelated fees or charges are imposed when the prepaid account balance is negative.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Another industry trade association indicated that a monthly fee to hold the prepaid account should not be a “finance charge” simply because it may be imposed when the balance on the prepaid account is negative or because negative balances can occur on the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A program manager indicated that the Bureau should clarify that a prepaid card is not a credit card simply because the prepaid account issuer charges reasonable debt collection costs (including attorney's fees) related to collecting the overdraft credit from a consumer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters were particularly concerned that under the proposal, a prepaid account issuer would need to waive per transaction fees in certain circumstances to avoid triggering the credit card rules. The circumstances raised by industry commenters centered on: (1) Force pay transactions; (2) payment cushions; and (3) transactions that take the account negative when a load of funds from an asset account is pending. These comments are discussed below and in further detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(4).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Force pay transactions.&lt;/em&gt; “Force pay” transactions occur where the prepaid account issuer is required by card network rules to pay a transaction even though there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the transaction at settlement. This can occur, for example, where a transaction is either not authorized in advance, or where there were sufficient or available funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account at the time the transaction is authorized, but there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature at the time the transaction is settled, and a negative balance results on the asset feature when the transaction is paid. Because the proposal's definition of finance charge was broad, a force pay transaction would have triggered application of the credit card rules unless the prepaid account issuer would have waived transaction fees. Industry commenters were nearly universally concerned about this outcome, arguing that the credit card rules should not apply so long as the same fee amount applies regardless of whether the transaction is paid entirely from funds in the prepaid account or is paid in whole or in part by credit. Industry commenters said requiring prepaid account issuers to waive per transaction fees to avoid triggering the credit card rules on all force pay transactions would be complicated and thus would impose substantial compliance costs. These commenters indicated that similar issues also may arise with other per transaction fees, such as currency conversion fees when assessed on force pay transactions.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One payment network predicted that if the proposal were finalized, rather than create complex waiver rules, a prepaid account issuer might instead impose much stricter authorization rules in order to prevent inadvertent overdrafts. This commenter indicated that this could make it more difficult for prepaid cardholders to use their cards at gas pumps, restaurants, hotels, or other locations where these overdrafts from force pay transactions are most likely to occur.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One program manager also indicated that while issuers of other prepaid products could possibly avoid being subject to the credit rules by changing their fee structure (&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; charging a monthly fee to hold the prepaid account instead of charging a per transaction fee), such an option is not available in the payroll card context because State wage and hour laws prohibit periodic fees on payroll card accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to force pay transactions, one consumer group commenter supported requiring a prepaid account issuer to waive the per transaction fee imposed on a credit transaction where credit is extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account in order to avoid triggering the credit card rules under the proposal. Nonetheless, this commenter indicated that if the Bureau decides to make any exceptions with respect to force pay transactions, these exceptions should be limited to prepaid account issuers who do everything possible to prevent overdrafts, have overdrafts in only very rare and unpreventable situations, and do not charge penalty fees related to declined transactions, overdrafts, or negative balances.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Another consumer group commenter similarly urged that if the Bureau decides to provide an exception for force pay transactions, the exception should only be allowed if the prepaid account issuer does not charge a fee to account holders who have a negative balance, and the exception should only be provided to those prepaid account issuers that take reasonable steps to minimize unpreventable overdrafts. In this case, the commenter said that the Bureau also should allow prepaid account issuers to recoup no more than 5 percent of funds deposited each month until all debts caused by unpreventable overdrafts are paid.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Payment cushions.&lt;/em&gt; One program manager also raised a concern about its de minimis purchase cushion, whereby it will authorize transactions for some consumers that result in a negative account balance so long as the shortfall is less than $10. For prepaid accounts where a per transaction fee is imposed on the prepaid account on all transactions regardless of whether the transaction is paid entirely with funds from the prepaid account or is paid with credit, a prepaid card would have been a credit card under the proposal unless the prepaid account issuer waived its per transaction fees on transactions that trigger the purchase cushion. This commenter said that it may not continue to offer its de minimis purchase cushion if it were required to waive these per transaction fees.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One consumer group commenter supported not triggering the credit card rules where a prepaid card can only access a de minimis amount of credit, using $10 as a safe harbor, if such credit is not promoted or disclosed.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Transactions that take the account negative when a load of funds from an asset account is pending.&lt;/em&gt; One digital wallet provider raised concerns that a prepaid card could be subjected to the credit card rules under the proposal where credit could be extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account for transactions that occur after a consumer has requested a load transaction from another asset account to pay for the transaction but the load transaction has not yet settled. In this case, transactions on the prepaid account may take the account balance negative until the load transaction from the asset account has settled. This can occur, for example, when a consumer authorizes a remittance through a mobile wallet which is linked to a checking account, the consumer requests that funds be taken from the consumer's checking account to pay for the remittance, and the remittance is sent before the incoming transfer of funds from the checking account is complete. In this case, the prepaid account issuer is extending credit through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account until the incoming transfer of funds from the checking account is complete.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The commenter indicated that in all its multi-currency transactions, it charges a currency conversion fee for the transaction, including on transactions where credit is extended as described above. Nonetheless, this currency conversion fee for a credit transaction as described above is the same amount as the fee charged for transactions that are paid entirely with funds from the prepaid account. This commenter indicated that under the proposal, it would need to waive this currency conversion fee for transactions where credit is extended to prevent the prepaid card from becoming a credit card under the proposal, even though the currency conversion fee it charges for these transactions is the same amount as the current conversion fee it charges for transactions entirely paid from funds from the prepaid account. This commenter said that if a prepaid card would be a credit card in this scenario and it was required to waive these fees in order to avoid triggering the credit card rules, it would likely stop processing transactions that take the prepaid account negative (such as remittances discussed above) before the incoming transfer of funds from the checking account is complete.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received on Prepaid Cards That Access Credit When No Fees for Credit Are Imposed</title>
        <analysisParagraph>One consumer group commenter expressed concern that the proposal to exclude prepaid cards from the definition of credit card if the prepaid card only accesses credit that is not subject to a finance charge, as defined in § 1026.4, or a fee described § 1026.4(c) would lead to evasions. For example, this commenter was concerned that a prepaid issuer could offer a “deluxe” prepaid card that comes with $100 in “free” overdraft protection, but the prepaid account issuer recovers the costs for the credit through other fees charged on the credit account that are not finance charges or fees described in § 1026.4(c), such as higher fees for “voluntary” credit insurance that is not a finance charge or fee described in § 1026.4(c). This commenter urged the Bureau to cover all prepaid cards as credit cards when the prepaid card accesses credit, regardless of whether a finance charge or a fee described under § 1026.4(c) is imposed for the credit. This commenter recognized, however, that exceptions for force pay transactions and payment cushions as discussed above may be necessary.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received on Account Numbers That Are Not Prepaid Cards</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) above, consumer group commenters indicated that the proposal with respect to push accounts was too limited. Several consumer group commenters suggested that the credit card rules should apply to a credit account even if the credit account did not function as an overdraft credit feature with respect to a prepaid account, so long as credit from the credit account was deposited into the prepaid account. These consumer group commenters indicated that the Bureau should apply the credit card rules to all credit transferred to a prepaid account, even if there is another way to access the credit.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Another consumer group commenter indicated that the Bureau should apply the credit card rules to all open-end lines of credit where credit may be deposited or transferred to prepaid accounts if either (1) the creditor is the same institution as or has a business relationship with the prepaid issuer; or (2) the creditor reasonably anticipates that a prepaid card will be used as an access device for the line of credit. Nonetheless, this commenter said that the final rule should not impact a completely unrelated credit account that has no connection to prepaid issuers or consumers identified as prepaid card users, even though the creditor allows credit to be transferred from the credit account through the ACH system.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One issuing bank and one law firm writing on behalf of a coalition of prepaid issuers did not support subjecting push accounts to credit card rules. One of these industry commenters indicated that attempting to cover push accounts as credit card accounts under the proposal created an overly complex regulatory regime to address the perceived risk of circumvention or evasion of the rules for overdraft plans set forth in the proposal.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One industry trade association commenter indicated that for arrangements where the consumer has the choice of whether to use the line of credit to cover specified overdrafts or to use the line of credit funds for other purposes, this commenter believes it would be inappropriate to treat the line of credit (or its associated account number) as a credit card. This commenter believed that consumer choice makes it clear that the line of credit is a general use line of credit and not a substitute for an overdraft line of credit.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Based on the comments received as discussed above, the Bureau is making substantial changes from the proposal to narrow the circumstances in which a prepaid card is a credit card (&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;i.e.,&lt;/em&gt; hybrid prepaid-credit card) under Regulation Z. A summary of these changes are discussed below. A more detailed description of the changes in the final rule based on the above comments is contained in the section-by-section analyses of § 1026.61(a)(1), (2) and (4).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Under the final rule, new § 1026.61(a) sets forth when a prepaid card is a credit card under the regulation. New § 1026.61(a)(1)(i) provides that credit offered in connection with a prepaid account is subject to new § 1026.61 and the regulation as specified in that section. New § 1026.61(a)(1)(ii) provides generally that a prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a separate credit feature, as described in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i), or with respect to a credit feature structured as a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account as described in new § 1026.61(a)(3). New § 1026.61(a)(1)(ii) also provides that a hybrid prepaid-credit card is a credit card for purposes of Regulation Z with respect to those respective credit features. New § 1026.61(a)(1)(iii) specifies that a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card—and thus not a credit card for purposes of Regulation Z—if the only credit offered in connection with the prepaid account is incidental credit meeting the conditions set forth in new § 1026.61(a)(4).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Separate credit features.&lt;/em&gt; As discussed in more detail below in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2), under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i), the term “covered separate credit feature” means a separate credit feature that is accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. Under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i), a prepaid card is a “hybrid prepaid-credit card” with respect to a separate credit feature (and thus the separate credit feature is a covered separate credit feature) if the card meets the following two conditions: (1) The card can be used from time to time to access credit from the credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; and (2) the credit feature is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. The hybrid prepaid-credit card can access both the covered credit feature and the asset feature of the prepaid account, and is a credit card under Regulation Z with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New § 1026.61(a)(2)(i) also provides that a separate credit feature that meets the two conditions set forth above is a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card even with respect to credit that is drawn or transferred, or authorized to be drawn or transferred, from the credit feature outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New § 1026.61(a)(2)(i) would capture overdraft credit features that are separate credit features offered by prepaid account issuers, their affiliates, or their business partners in connection with a prepaid account. For example, a prepaid card is a “hybrid prepaid-credit card” with respect to a separate credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner in cases where transactions can be initiated using a prepaid card when there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature in the prepaid account at the time the transaction is initiated, and credit can be drawn, transferred, or authorized to be drawn or transferred, from the credit feature at the time the transaction is authorized to complete the transaction. In addition, a prepaid card is a “hybrid prepaid-credit card” with respect to such a credit feature in cases related to settlement of transactions where credit can be automatically drawn, transferred, or authorized to be drawn or transferred, from the credit feature to settle transactions made with the card where there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account at the time the transaction is settled.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New § 1026.61(a)(2)(i) also captures situations where transactions can be initiated using a prepaid card where the card is a traditional “dual purpose” card. In this case, the card can be used both to access the asset feature of a prepaid account and to draw on the covered separate credit feature independent of whether there are sufficient or available funds in the asset feature to complete the transaction. For example, assume that a consumer has $50 in available funds in her prepaid account. The consumer initiates a $25 transaction with the card to purchase goods and services. If the consumer chooses at the time the transaction is initiated to use the card to access the asset feature of the prepaid account, the card will draw on the funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account to complete the transaction. If the consumer chooses at the time the transaction is initiated to use the card to access the covered separate credit feature, the card will draw on credit from the covered separate credit feature to complete the transaction, regardless of the fact that there were sufficient or available funds in the prepaid account to complete the transaction.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail below in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2), new § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii) defines the term “non-covered separate credit feature” to mean a separate credit feature that does not meet the two conditions set forth in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i). A prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a non-covered separate credit feature, even if the prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a covered separate credit feature as described in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i). A non-covered separate credit feature is not subject to the rules in Regulation Z applicable to hybrid prepaid-credit cards; however, it typically will be subject to Regulation Z depending on its own terms and conditions, independent of the connection to the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>First, a separate credit feature is a “non-covered separate credit feature” when the separate credit feature is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. This is true even if the separate credit feature functions as an overdraft credit feature with respect to the prepaid account. For example, if a consumer links her prepaid account to a credit card issued by a card issuer, where the card issuer is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner, and credit is drawn automatically into the prepaid account in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the prepaid card for which there are insufficient funds in the prepaid account, the prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to the separate credit feature offered by the unrelated third party.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Second, a separate credit feature is a “non-covered separate credit feature” if a prepaid card cannot access the separate credit feature during the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. This is true even if the separate credit feature is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. For example, assume that a consumer can only conduct a draw or transfer of credit, or authorization of either, from a separate credit feature to a prepaid account at the prepaid account issuer's Web site, and these draws, transfers, or authorizations cannot occur in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction at the Web site to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For this type of “non-covered separate credit feature,” the credit feature would not be functioning as an overdraft credit feature with respect to the prepaid account. In addition, the prepaid card also is not functioning as a traditional “dual purpose” card where the card can be used both to access the asset feature of a prepaid account and to draw on a credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers independent of whether there are sufficient or available funds in the asset feature to complete the transaction. Instead, the prepaid card can only be used to draw or transfer credit from a separate credit feature outside the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As described above, under new § 1026.61(a)(1)(i) and final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i), a prepaid card is a credit card (&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;i.e.,&lt;/em&gt; a hybrid prepaid-credit card) for purposes of this regulation with respect to a covered separate credit feature. The Bureau is using its interpretive authority under TILA section 105(a) to define such prepaid cards as credit cards under TILA section 103(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;l&lt;/em&gt;). The Bureau believes that defining such prepaid cards as credit cards under § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) is consistent with the definition of “credit card” in TILA section 103(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;l&lt;/em&gt;). TILA section 103(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;l&lt;/em&gt;) defines the term “credit card” to mean any card, plate, coupon book, or other credit device existing for the purpose of obtaining money, property, labor, or services on credit.&lt;footnote ref="697"&gt;15 U.S.C. 1602(&amp;lt;em data-original="E-03"&amp;gt;l&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;).&lt;/footnote&gt;

             The Bureau believes that such a prepaid card meets this TILA definition of “credit card” because it can be used from time to time to obtain credit from the separate credit feature in the course of completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For the reasons set forth in the &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z&lt;/em&gt; section, the Bureau believes that most overdraft credit features offered in connection with prepaid accounts should be treated as credit card accounts under Regulation Z, except in limited circumstances as discussed below and in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(4). As discussed further below, however, the Bureau is concerned about covering prepaid cards as credit cards when the cards can access separate credit features offered by unrelated third parties that have no affiliation or business arrangement with the prepaid account issuer, even if the separate credit feature functions as an overdraft credit feature in relation to the prepaid account. In this case, the unrelated third party may not be aware when its credit feature is used as an overdraft credit feature with respect to a prepaid account. If unrelated third parties were subject to the provisions applicable to hybrid prepaid-credit cards, these third parties would face additional compliance risk in connection with the prepaid card becoming a new access device for the credit account. The Bureau is concerned that such third parties might take steps to try to mitigate these kinds of risks, which would make prepaid accounts less widely usable by consumers. Thus, as discussed above and in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, the final rule does not cover a prepaid card as a credit card under Regulation Z when it accesses separate credit features offered by these unrelated third parties. In order to facilitate compliance with TILA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its exception authority under TILA section 105(a) to exclude such prepaid cards from the definition of “credit card” under TILA section 103(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;l&lt;/em&gt;) and final Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(15)(i). The exception would facilitate compliance by allowing an unrelated third party to comply with the rules in Regulation Z that already apply to the separate credit feature without having to comply with additional Regulation Z provisions that would apply if the prepaid card were covered as a credit card with respect to the credit feature. Under this exception, third parties would not face additional compliance risk in connection with the prepaid card becoming a new access device for the credit account, where the prepaid card may be linked to the separate credit feature without the knowledge of the unrelated third party.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above and in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, the Bureau also is clarifying that a prepaid card is not a credit card when the prepaid card accesses a separate credit feature that is not functioning as an overdraft credit feature, and the card is not a traditional “dual purpose” card as discussed above. In this case, the prepaid card only can access the separate credit feature outside the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. Pursuant to its interpretive authority under TILA section 105(a), the Bureau is defining “credit card” in current TILA section 103(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;l&lt;/em&gt;) and final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) to exclude a prepaid card from being covered as a credit card with respect to a separate credit feature when it only can access credit from the separate credit feature outside the course of completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. The Bureau does not interpret TILA section 103(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;l&lt;/em&gt;) to encompass an account number for a prepaid account to be a “credit card” under TILA section 103(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;l&lt;/em&gt;) when the prepaid account number can only be used as a destination for the transfer of money from a separate credit account, and cannot be used to obtain credit within the course of a transaction to obtain goods or service, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. The Bureau believes that when credit is accessed outside of the course of a transaction on a prepaid account, it is somewhat less risky for consumers because consumers would be required to make a deliberate decision to access the credit outside the course of a transaction, and thus can separately evaluate the tradeoffs involved. In addition, as discussed further below, this approach is consistent with regard to how lines of credit that can be accessed by debit cards are treated under the credit card rules in Regulation Z. Thus, consistent with this current definition of “credit card,” the Bureau is clarifying that a prepaid card is not a credit card with respect to a separate credit feature when it can only access the separate credit feature outside the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. The Bureau also believes that this clarification is consistent with the proposal's general focus on covering overdraft credit features offered in connection with prepaid accounts as credit card accounts under Regulation Z.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Credit extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account.&lt;/em&gt; As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(3) below, under new § 1026.61(a)(3), a prepaid card that can access credit extended through a negative balance on the asset balance of the prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card unless the card can only access incidental credit as described in new § 1026.61(a)(4). This provision is intended to trigger coverage under the credit card rules with respect to such overdraft credit features. Thus, for purposes of coverage, a person offering such an overdraft credit feature is a “card issuer” under final § 1026.2(a)(7) that is subject to Regulation Z, including § 1026.61(b).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In terms of triggering coverage under Regulation Z, under new § 1026.61(a)(1)(i) and (3)(i) and final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i), a prepaid card is a credit card (&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;i.e.,&lt;/em&gt; hybrid prepaid-credit card) for purposes of this regulation when it is a single device that can be used from time to time to access credit extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account, unless the card can only access incidental credit as described in new § 1026.61(a)(4). The Bureau is using its interpretive authority under TILA section 105(a) to define such prepaid cards as credit cards under TILA section 103(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;l&lt;/em&gt;). The Bureau believes that classifying such prepaid cards as credit cards under § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) is consistent with the definition of “credit card” in TILA section 103(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;l&lt;/em&gt;). TILA section 103(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;l&lt;/em&gt;) defines the term “credit card” to mean any card, plate, coupon book, or other credit device existing for the purpose of obtaining money, property, labor, or services on credit.&lt;footnote ref="698"&gt;15 U.S.C. 1602(&amp;lt;em data-original="E-03"&amp;gt;l&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;).&lt;/footnote&gt;
             The Bureau believes that such a prepaid card meets this TILA definition of “credit card” because it can be used from time to time to access credit that is extended as a negative balance on the prepaid account in the course of completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>However, as discussed further below, new § 1026.61(b) prohibits a card issuer from structuring an overdraft credit feature as a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account, unless the program is structured to involve only incidental credit as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4). The Bureau believes that this rule is necessary to promote transparency and compliance with the credit card requirements. Thus, under new § 1026.61(b), a card issuer must structure an overdraft credit feature in connection with a prepaid account as a separate credit feature, such as a credit account or credit subaccount to the prepaid account that is separate from the asset feature of the prepaid account, except for overdraft credit features described in new § 1026.61(a)(4). This separate credit feature is a “covered separate credit feature” under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As described in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(4) below, new § 1026.61(a)(4) provides that an overdraft credit feature structured as a negative balance on the asset feature of a prepaid account is not accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card where: (1) The prepaid card cannot access a covered separate credit feature as defined in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i); (2) with respect to the prepaid account accessible by the prepaid card, the prepaid account issuer generally has a policy and practice of declining to authorize transactions made with the card when there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the amount of the transactions, or the prepaid account issuer only authorizes those transactions in circumstances related to certain payment cushions and delayed load cushions; and (3) with respect to the prepaid account that is accessible by the prepaid card, the prepaid account issuer does not charge credit-related fees for any credit extended on the asset feature of the prepaid account, except for fees or charges for the actual costs of collecting the credit extended if otherwise permitted by law.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Under this exception, a prepaid account issuer may extend credit through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account in certain situations, such as force pay transactions, without having to waive general transaction fees, as would have been required under the proposal to avoid triggering the credit card rules. As discussed above, force pay transactions occur where the prepaid account issuer is required by card network rules to pay a transaction even though there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the transaction at settlement. This can occur, for example, where a transaction is either not authorized in advance, or where there were sufficient or available funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account at the time the transaction is authorized, but there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature at the time the transaction is settled, and a negative balance results on the asset feature when the transaction is paid.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The exception in new § 1026.61(a)(4) also would allow a prepaid account issuer to adopt a payment cushion where the issuer could authorize transactions that would take the account balance negative by no more than $10 at the time the transaction is authorized. In addition, the exception would allow a prepaid account issuer to adopt a delayed load cushion. Specifically, in cases where the prepaid account issuer has received an instruction or confirmation for an incoming EFT originated from a separate asset account to load funds to the prepaid account or where the prepaid account issuer has received a request from the consumer to load funds to the prepaid account from a separate asset account but in either case the funds from the separate asset account have not yet settled, the final rule allows a prepaid account issuer to authorize transactions that take the prepaid account negative, so long as the transactions will not cause the account balance to become negative at the time of the authorization by more than the incoming or requested load amount, as applicable.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Thus, the Bureau is intending to exempt overdraft credit features that are structured as a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account under Regulation Z where the prepaid account issuer generally is not authorizing transactions that will take the asset feature of the prepaid account negative and the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees on credit extended on the asset feature of the prepaid account. As discussed in more detail below, the Bureau believes that this exception will address a substantial number of the concerns expressed by industry commenters about situations in which the proposal would have required them to waive general transaction fees on incidental credit to avoid triggering the credit card rules. In light of the very limited nature of the incidental credit at issue, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to exclude this incidental credit from coverage under Regulation Z. Thus, to facilitate compliance with TILA, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its exception authority under TILA section 105(a), to exclude such prepaid cards that qualify for the exception under new § 1026.61(a)(4) from the definition of “credit card” under TILA section 103(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;l&lt;/em&gt;) and final Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(15)(i).&lt;footnote ref="699"&gt;15 U.S.C. 1602(&amp;lt;em data-original="E-03"&amp;gt;l&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;).&lt;/footnote&gt;
             The exception in new § 1026.61(a)(4) would facilitate compliance by allowing a prepaid account issuer to comply only with Regulation E with respect to the prepaid account and this incidental credit, instead of also complying with Regulation Z with respect to the incidental credit.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Given that a prepaid account issuer can only extend credit through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account in limited circumstances under the exception in new § 1026.61(a)(4), and credit-related fees generally may not be imposed for the credit extended, the Bureau anticipates that the credit extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of a prepaid account that qualifies for the exception would be limited. The Bureau believes that certain harms to consumers, such as becoming overextended in using this credit, would be limited. Thus, to facilitate compliance, the Bureau believes that this type of credit is more properly regulated under Regulation E as credit incidental to the prepaid card transaction. For example, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation E § 1005.12(a) above, Regulation E's provisions in final §§ 1005.11 and 1005.18(e) regarding error resolution would apply to extensions of this credit. In addition, such credit extensions would be disclosed on Regulation E periodic statements under existing § 1005.9(b) or, if the financial institution follows the periodic statement alternative in final § 1005.18(c)(1), on the electronic and written histories of the consumer's prepaid account transactions.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Also, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation E § 1005.17 above, although this incidental credit generally is governed by Regulation E, the Bureau is exempting this incidental credit from the opt-in rule in final § 1005.17. Existing § 1005.17 sets forth requirements that financial institutions must follow in order to provide “overdraft services” to consumers related to consumers' accounts. Under existing § 1005.17, financial institutions must provide consumers with notice of their right to opt-in, or affirmatively consent, to the institution's overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions, and obtain the consumer's affirmative consent before fees or charges may be assessed on the consumer's account for paying such overdrafts. For the reasons discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation E § 1005.17 above, the Bureau is adding new § 1005.17(a)(4) to provide that credit accessed from an overdraft credit feature that is exempt from Regulation Z under § 1026.61(a)(4) is not an overdraft service under final § 1005.17(a) and thus would not be subject to the opt-in requirements in final § 1005.17. This is true even though the prepaid account issuer may be charging per transaction fees that are permitted under new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B) with respect to credit accessed from the overdraft credit feature. The Bureau does not believe that the opt-in requirements in final § 1005.17 are appropriate for these types of overdraft credit features given that these overdraft credit features may not charge higher per transaction fees for credit extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account than the per transaction fees charged when the transaction only accesses funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Account numbers that are not prepaid cards.&lt;/em&gt; As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) above, upon review of the comments and its own analysis, the Bureau has decided not to adopt the proposal to provide that an account number for a credit account would be a credit card where extensions of credit are permitted to be deposited directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. In proposing these provisions, the Bureau was concerned that a prepaid account issuer and a creditor could design arrangements to circumvent the proposed rules in Regulation Z applicable to prepaid cards that are credit cards. In this case, a third-party creditor could have an arrangement with the prepaid account issuer such that credit from the credit account is pushed from the credit account to the prepaid account during the course of a particular prepaid account transaction to prevent the transaction from taking the prepaid account balance negative. These provisions related to account numbers of the credit account were designed to prevent this type of evasion of the rules applicable to prepaid cards that are credit cards.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is addressing this type of evasion by generally covering a prepaid card as a credit card (&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;i.e.,&lt;/em&gt; “hybrid prepaid-credit card”) when the card can access a separate credit feature that is functioning as an overdraft credit feature and is offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner.&lt;footnote ref="700"&gt;One consumer group commenter urged the Bureau to include an anti-evasion provision in the final rule. This commenter believed that the Bureau should be able to rely on an anti-evasion rule to prohibit conduct that clearly is against the spirt of the rules, even if the final rule does not specifically prohibit that activity. The Bureau is not adopting such an anti-evasion rule at this time. The Bureau in various ways has crafted the final rule to address potential areas of evasion that could arise with respect to the application of the rules in Regulation Z to overdraft credit features offered by prepaid account issuers, their affiliates, or their business partners in connection with prepaid accounts. &amp;lt;em data-original="E-03"&amp;gt;See, e.g.,&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; the section-by-section analyses of &amp;amp;#167;§ 1026.2(a)(7) and (a)(15)(i) and 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) above, and 1026.61(a)(4) and (a)(5)(iii) below.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             Specifically, new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i) provides that a prepaid card is a “hybrid prepaid-credit card” with respect to a separate credit feature if the card meets the following two conditions: (1) The card can be used from time to time to access credit from the separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; and (2) the separate credit feature is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. New § 1026.61(a)(2)(i) defines such a separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as a “covered separate credit feature.” Thus, the hybrid prepaid-credit card can access both the covered separate credit feature and the asset feature of the prepaid account, and the hybrid prepaid-credit card is a credit card under Regulation Z with respect to the covered separate credit feature. In this case, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, the final rule provides that a prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to the covered separate credit feature regardless of whether (1) the credit is pushed from the covered separate credit feature to the asset feature of the prepaid account in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; or (2) the credit is pulled from the covered separate credit feature to the asset feature of the prepaid account in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, the final rule also provides that a prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a covered separate credit feature regardless of whether the covered separate credit feature can only be used as an overdraft credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card, or whether it is a general line of credit that can be accessed in other ways than through the hybrid prepaid-credit card. For the reasons set forth in the &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z&lt;/em&gt; section, the Bureau believes that consumers will benefit from the application of the credit card rules generally to a credit account that functions as an overdraft credit feature in connection with a prepaid account when that overdraft feature is offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner, regardless of whether the credit account can only be used as an overdraft credit feature. In addition, the Bureau is concerned about potential evasion if the provisions set forth in the final rule applicable to overdraft credit features described above could be avoided simply by providing other uses for the credit account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that the provisions in the final rule described above with respect to a covered separate credit feature adequately capture situations where a separate credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner functions as an overdraft credit feature in relation to a prepaid account. Thus, the Bureau believes that it is no longer necessary to treat an account number of the credit account as a credit card to capture situations when the credit account may function as an overdraft credit feature in relation to the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above and in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, the Bureau generally intends to cover under Regulation Z overdraft credit features in connection with prepaid accounts where the credit features are offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliates, or its business partners. As discussed above and in more detail in the section-by-section analyses of § 1026.61(a)(2) and (4) below, the Bureau also has decided to exclude prepaid cards from being covered as credit cards under Regulation Z when they access certain specified types of credit. First, under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii), a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a “non-covered separate credit feature,” which means that the separate credit feature either (1) cannot be accessed in the course of a prepaid card transaction to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers, or (2) is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. Second, under new § 1026.61(a)(4), a prepaid card also is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card when the prepaid card accesses incidental credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account where the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit. A prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 or a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) when it accesses credit from these types of credit features. For more detailed explanations of when prepaid cards are not credit cards under Regulation Z, see the section-by-section analyses of § 1026.61(a)(2) and (4) below.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.12(a) above, credit cards generally may not be issued on an unsolicited basis. Thus, TILA section 132 and existing § 1026.12(a) prevent a card issuer from issuing on an unsolicited basis a prepaid card that also is a credit card at the time of issuance. For example, prepaid cards that are sold in retail locations could not access automatically an overdraft credit feature that would make the prepaid card into a credit card at the time the prepaid card is sold. Under TILA section 132 and existing § 1026.12(a), a card issuer could add a credit card feature to a prepaid card only in response to a consumer's explicit request or application.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to use its authority in TILA section 105(a) and Dodd-Frank Act section 1032(a) to add new proposed § 1026.12(h)(1) that would have required card issuers to wait at least 30 days after a prepaid account is registered before the card issuer may make a solicitation or provide an application to the holder of the prepaid account to open a credit or charge card account that would be accessed by a prepaid card. In addition, card issuers would have been required to wait until at least 30 days after registration to open a credit card account for the holder of a prepaid account that would be accessed by the prepaid card. Moreover, if a card issuer has established an existing credit or charge card account with a holder of a prepaid account that is accessed by a prepaid, the card issuer would have been prevented from allowing an additional prepaid card obtained by the consumer from the card issuer to access the credit or charge card account, until at least 30 days after the consumer has registered the additional prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1026.12(h)(2) would have defined “solicitation” for purposes of § 1026.12(h)(1) to mean an offer by the card issuer to open a credit or charge card account that does not require the consumer to complete an application. This proposed definition of “solicitation” would have been the same as one used with respect to credit card disclosures set forth in existing § 1026.60(a)(1) that must be provided on or with credit card applications and solicitations. See the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.60 above. Consistent with existing § 1026.60, proposed § 1026.12(h)(2) also would have specified that a “firm offer of credit,” as defined in section 603(l) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act &lt;footnote ref="712"&gt;15 U.S.C. 1681a(l).&lt;/footnote&gt;
             for a credit or charge card, would be a solicitation for purposes of proposed § 1026.12(h).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 12(h)-1 would have explained that a prepaid card or prepaid account is registered, such that the 30-day timing requirement required by proposed § 1026.12(h) begins, when the issuer of the prepaid card or prepaid account successfully completes its collection of consumer identifying information and identity verification in accordance with the requirements of applicable Federal and State law. The beginning of the required 30-day timing requirement would have been triggered by successful completion of collection of consumer identifying information and identity verification, not by the consumer's mere purchase or obtaining of the card.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 12(h)-2 would have provided a cross-reference to existing § 1026.12(a)(1) and proposed comment 12(a)(1)-7 for additional rules that would apply to the addition of a credit or charge card account to a previously-issued prepaid account. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.12(a)(1) above, proposed comment 12(a)(1)-7 would have provided that a credit card feature may be added to a previously issued prepaid card only upon the consumer's specific request and only in compliance with proposed § 1026.12(h). Proposed comment 12(h)-2 also would have cross-referenced § 1026.60 and related commentary for disclosures that generally must be provided on or with applications or solicitations to open a credit or charge card account.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Several consumer group commenters urged the Bureau to extend the 30-day waiting period to 90 days. They noted that in 30 days, the consumer will only have completed one monthly cycle and will not have time to explore all the card's features. They believed that more time would help the consumer see whether she can manage her finances without resorting to credit at the end of the month. They also believed that a 90 day waiting period would help creditors to determine whether the consumer has the ability to repay credit.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several commenters, including industry trade associations, an issuing bank, and a payment network, indicated that the Bureau should not adopt a waiting period. For example, one payment network said that this approach may create burdens and frustration for consumers who are explicitly seeking a prepaid account that has credit features. This commenter believed that the risks identified by the Bureau are more appropriately mitigated by requiring an affirmative consumer opt-in for any prepaid card to be linked with a credit feature, and that this opt-in can be given only after disclosures about the credit have been provided.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One digital wallet provider suggested that the Bureau clarify that this restriction does not apply to a digital wallet's funding sources. This commenter was concerned that applying the 30-day waiting period to digital wallets would effectively ban new consumers from linking a credit card as a funding source for their digital wallet.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>After consideration of the comments, the Bureau is adopting the 30-day waiting period largely as proposed. Specifically, the Bureau is moving proposed § 1026.12(h) to new § 1026.61(c) and is revising it to clarify the intent of the provision and to be consistent with new § 1026.61(a).&lt;footnote ref="713"&gt;The proposal would have provided that the term “credit card” includes an account number that is not a prepaid card that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan that allows deposits directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. The proposal also would have applied the provisions in proposed § 1026.12(h) to credit card accounts accessed by such accounts numbers. For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) above, the final rule does not adopt the provisions in proposed § 1026.12(h) (renumbered as new § 1026.61(c)) related to these account numbers.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             Specifically, new § 1026.61(c)(1) provides that with respect to a covered separate credit feature that could be accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card at any point, a card issuer must not do any of the following until 30 days after the prepaid account has been registered: (1) Open a covered separate credit feature that could be accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card; (2) make a solicitation or provide an application to open a covered separate credit feature that could be accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card; or (3) allow an existing credit feature that was opened prior to the consumer obtaining the prepaid account to become a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New § 1026.61(c)(2) provides that for purposes of new § 1026.61(c), the term “solicitation” has the same meaning set forth in § 1026.60(a)(1). The term “solicitation” in existing § 1026.60(a)(1) means an offer by the card issuer to open a credit or charge card account that does not require the consumer to complete an application. In addition, existing § 1026.60(a)(1) provides that a “firm offer of credit” as defined in section 603(l) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act &lt;footnote ref="714"&gt;15 U.S.C. 1681a(l).&lt;/footnote&gt;
             for a credit or charge card is a solicitation for purposes of existing § 1026.60(a)(1). The definition of “solicitation” in new § 1026.61(c)(2) is the same as the proposed definition of “solicitation” in proposed § 1026.12(h). The final rule cross-references the definition of “solicitation” in existing § 1026.60(a)(1) rather than repeating the same definition in new § 1026.61(c).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is moving proposed comment 12(h)-1 to comment 61(c)-1 and is revising it to provide additional clarification. Consistent with the proposal, new comment 61(c)-1 provides that a prepaid card or prepaid account is registered, such that the 30-day timing requirement required by new § 1026.61(c) begins, when the issuer of the prepaid card or prepaid account successfully completes its collection of consumer identifying information and identity verification in accordance with the requirements of applicable Federal and State law. The beginning of the required 30-day timing requirement is triggered by successful completion of collection of consumer identifying information and identity verification, not by the consumer's mere purchase or obtaining of the card. New comment 61(c)-1 is revised from the proposal to provide guidance on situations where customer identification and verification are completed on a prepaid account before the account is opened. In that case, new comment 61(c)(1)-1 provides that the 30-day timing requirement begins on the day the prepaid account is opened.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is moving proposed comment 12(h)-2 to new comment 61(c)-2 and is adopting it as proposed. The Bureau also is adding new comment 61(c)-3 to address situations where a hybrid prepaid-credit card is replaced or substituted for another hybrid prepaid-credit card. Specifically, new comment 61(c)-3 provides that a card issuer is not required to comply with new § 1026.61(c) when a hybrid prepaid-credit card is permitted to be replaced, or substituted, for another hybrid prepaid-credit card without a request or application under final § 1026.12(a)(2) and related commentary. For example, new § 1026.61(c) does not apply to situations where a prepaid account or credit feature that is accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card is replaced because of security concerns, and a new hybrid prepaid-credit card is issued to access the new prepaid account or credit feature without a request or application under final § 1026.12(a)(2).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With regard to comments urging the Bureau to clarify that the 30-day restriction does not apply to a digital wallet's funding sources, the Bureau is adding new comment 61(a)(1)-4 to provide guidance on the circumstances in which a prepaid account number for a digital wallet that is a prepaid account is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61(a).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Specifically, new comment 61(a)(1)-4.i states that a digital wallet that is capable of being loaded with funds is a prepaid account under final Regulation E § 1005.2(b)(3). &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; final Regulation E § 1005.2(b)(3) and comment 2(b)(3)(i)-6. The comment explains that a prepaid account number that can access such a digital wallet is a hybrid prepaid-credit card if it meets the conditions set forth in new § 1026.61(a). See new comment 61(a)(1)-4 for illustrations of this rule.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Thus, new § 1026.61(c) applies to a digital wallet that is capable of being loaded with funds (and thus is a prepaid account under final Regulation E § 1005.2(b)(3)), where the prepaid account number that can access such a digital wallet is a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61(a). The Bureau believes that this additional guidance will help relieve any concerns that the 30-day period would effectively ban new consumers from linking a credit card as a funding source for their digital wallet, except where the linked credit feature is a covered separate credit feature as defined in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With regard to the two conflicting sets of comments urging the Bureau to drop the 30-day waiting period entirely and conversely to expand it to 90 days, the Bureau has concluded based on additional consideration to adopt the 30-day waiting period as proposed. The Bureau continues to believe the 30-day waiting period would benefit consumers by separating the decisions to obtain and register the prepaid account from the decision to obtain a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card. Nonetheless, the Bureau believes that extending the waiting period to 90 days seems unnecessary to ensure that a consumer can make an informed decision regarding whether to link the account to a covered separate credit feature. The Bureau believes that a longer waiting period may restrict consumers who are seeking prepaid accounts with covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that if the prepaid account issuer offers the covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card, the prepaid account issuer is the “card issuer” for purposes of Regulation Z, including new § 1026.61(c). This is because the hybrid prepaid-credit card accessing the covered separate credit feature is a credit card, and existing § 1026.2(a)(7) defines “card issuer” as a person that issues a credit card or that person's agent with respect to the card. If the prepaid account issuer's affiliate or business partner offers the covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, both the person offering the covered separate credit feature and the prepaid account issuer are card issuers for purposes of new § 1026.61(c). In this case, under new comment 2(a)(7)-1.ii, the person offering the covered separate credit feature would be an agent of the prepaid account issuer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that use of its authority under TILA section 105(a) to add the provisions in new § 1026.61(c) is necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of TILA to help ensure the informed use of the credit or charge card account when it is opened. Specifically, TILA section 102 provides that one of the main purposes of TILA is to promote the informed use of credit by ensuring meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that consumers will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available and avoid the uninformed use of credit.&lt;footnote ref="715"&gt;15 U.S.C. 1601.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             Furthermore, TILA section 132 requires that no credit card shall be issued except in response to a request or application therefor.&lt;footnote ref="716"&gt;15 U.S.C. 1642.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             In addition, the Bureau believes that the waiting period will, consistent with Dodd-Frank Act section 1032(a), ensure that the features of the covered separate credit feature offered in connection with the prepaid account are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits the consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that the requirement in new § 1026.61(c) of a 30-day waiting period for a prepaid card to access a covered separate credit feature will promote the informed and voluntary use of credit. Under new § 1026.12(c)(1), a card issuer must not do any of the following until 30 days after the prepaid account has been registered: (1) Open a covered separate credit feature that could be accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card; (2) make a solicitation or provide an application to open a covered separate credit feature that could be accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card; or (3) allow an existing credit feature that was opened prior to the consumer obtaining the prepaid account to become a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card. The Bureau believes that it would promote the informed use of the credit to separate the decision to purchase and register a prepaid account from the decision to accept an offer to add a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. The Bureau believes that consumers may be able to focus more effectively on the credit terms of the covered separate credit feature, and make a more informed decision whether to request such a credit feature, if the decision to accept the credit feature occurs apart from the process to register the card. Without these protections, card issuers may attempt to market the covered separate credit feature to prepaid cardholders at the time they purchase the prepaid card or at registration. The Bureau believes that without this provision, prepaid account issuers would be likely to provide solicitations or applications to the prepaid cardholder to open a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, or suggest that the prepaid cardholder allow an existing credit feature held by the prepaid cardholder to become a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, at the time the prepaid accounts are registered because prepaid account issuers will already be collecting information from the cardholders in order to register the prepaid accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Without the waiting period, consumers may feel pressured to decide whether to add the covered separate credit feature without having the opportunity to fully consider the terms of the credit feature and the consequences of obtaining the credit feature. Therefore, the Bureau believes that a consumer's decision to add a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card to the prepaid account should be distinct from the decision to obtain or register the prepaid card.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau believes that separating these decisions would better allow consumers to focus on the terms and conditions that apply to the prepaid account at the time of purchase and registration, which may enable the consumer to better understand those terms and conditions. This is consistent with EFTA section 905(a), which requires financial institutions to disclose the terms and conditions of EFTs involving a consumer's account. The Bureau also believes that requiring at least 30 days to elapse between the registration of a prepaid account and any offer of a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card would enhance consumer understanding of the terms of the prepaid account and would help consumers to make more informed decisions regarding linking a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card to the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation E § 1005.18(e)(3) above, existing customer identification requirements limit the functionality of most prepaid accounts prior to registration. In addition, the registration process is critical for application of full Regulation E protections under this final rule. For example, Regulation E § 1005.18(e)(3) provides that for all prepaid accounts, other than payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts, with respect to which the financial institution has not completed its identification and verification process (or for which the financial institution has no process), the financial institution is not required to provisionally credit the consumer's account in the event the financial institution takes longer than 10 or 20 business days, as applicable, to investigate and determine whether an error occurred.&lt;footnote ref="717"&gt;See also new Regulation E § 1005.18(c)(2), which provides a modified version of the periodic statement alternative for prepaid accounts that cannot be or have not been verified by the financial institution.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             If a card issuer were allowed to market covered separate credit features to consumers at the time of prepaid account registration, the Bureau is concerned that that consumers could believe that they are required to request that the covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card be linked to the prepaid account in order to register or access the prepaid account. This could cause some consumers to not register their prepaid accounts and lose important protections under Regulation E.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>61(b) Structure of Credit Features Accessible by Hybrid Prepaid-Credit Cards</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Under the proposal, credit plans, including overdraft services and overdraft lines of credit, that are directly accessed by certain prepaid cards would have been subject to the rules for credit cards under Regulation Z. In particular, proposed comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.F would have provided that the term “credit card” includes a prepaid card (including a prepaid card that is solely an account number) that is a single device that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan, except if that prepaid card only accesses credit that is not subject to any finance charge, as defined in § 1026.4, or any fee described in § 1026.4(c), and is not payable by written agreement in more than four installments.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The proposal made clear that the Bureau intended that the credit card rules apply broadly to a range of product structures. In the proposal, for instance, the Bureau specifically stated that the proposal was intended to cover: (1) Transactions that are authorized where the consumer has insufficient or unavailable funds in the prepaid account at the time of authorization; and (2) transactions on a prepaid account where the consumer has insufficient or unavailable funds in the prepaid account at the time the transaction is paid. Such transactions would have been credit accessed by a prepaid card that is a credit card under the proposal, regardless of whether the person established a separate credit account to extend the credit or whether the credit was simply reflected as a negative balance on the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition to proposing a broad scope of coverage, the Bureau sought to explore practical considerations regarding product structure and operations for credit that would be subject to the credit card rules. Specifically, in the proposal, the Bureau stated its belief that creditors would tend to establish separate credit accounts to extend credit accessed by the prepaid card that is a credit card, instead of having the credit balance be reflected as a negative balance on the prepaid account, because creditors generally would find that separate credit accounts aid compliance with the periodic statement requirements in proposed §§ 1026.5(b)(2)(ii) and 1026.7(b)(11) and the offset provisions in proposed § 1026.12(d)(3) that would apply to credit card accounts accessed by prepaid cards. The Bureau solicited comment on whether creditors would likely establish separate credit accounts, instead of reflecting the credit balance as a negative balance on the prepaid account. The Bureau also solicited comment on any implications for compliance depending on how the account is structured (&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;i.e.,&lt;/em&gt; whether a separate credit account is created or whether the credit balance is reflected as a negative balance on the prepaid account) and whether any differentiation in regulation or guidance would be useful.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The commenters that responded to the Bureau's questions on this issue universally supported separate account structures. Specifically, one industry trade association stated that it believed a credit feature that is accessed by a prepaid card that is a credit card under the proposal should not be structured as a negative prepaid account balance. This commenter pointed out that, if an account is a “dual” account, the overdraft line of credit would only be accessed if a transaction amount were more than the amount in the prepaid account, and such a transaction would create two distinct balances. Similarly, one consumer group commenter stated with respect to credit accessed by a prepaid card that is a credit card, the Bureau should require the credit feature to be structured as a separate account, rather than reflected as a negative balance on the prepaid account. This commenter indicated that allowing credit to be reflected solely as a negative balance on the prepaid account would be confusing to consumers and would undercut the message that the consumer is being given credit, and being charged for credit.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>After consideration of these comments and additional internal analysis regarding transparency and compliance concerns, in the final rule, the Bureau requires that credit features that are accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card be structured as a separate credit feature—either a separate sub-account or account—rather than as a negative balance on the asset feature of a prepaid account. While a negative balance structure would be permissible where an issuer only offers incidental credit pursuant to new § 1026.61(a)(4),&lt;footnote ref="707"&gt;If a prepaid account issuer complies with the exception in § 1026.61(a)(4) with respect to a prepaid account that is accessed by a prepaid card, the prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under Regulation Z, and thus is not a credit card under Regulation Z. The prepaid account issuer is not a card issuer under § 1026.2(a)(7) and thus, § 1026.61(b) does not apply to the overdraft credit feature accessed by the prepaid card.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             an issuer that offers more extensive credit or charges credit-related fees using a negative balance structure would be subject to the credit card rules, pursuant to new § 1026.61(a)(3), and would be in violation of the rule on account structure specified in new § 1026.61(b). Instead, under the final rule, a card issuer must structure the credit feature as a separate credit feature, either as a separate credit account, or as a credit subaccount of a prepaid account that is separate from the asset feature of the prepaid account. The separate credit feature is a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that this structural requirement will make it substantially easier for creditors and consumers alike to implement and understand credit accessible via a hybrid prepaid-credit card under a credit card regime. Regulation Z's open-end rules are generally drafted with the assumption that the product in question is a pure credit product, without substantial positive funds. For example, existing § 1026.11(a) generally provides that creditors must refund any positive balances on the credit account to the consumer within six months. And, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.4(a) above, the rules for defining finance charges in the credit card context generally treat all transaction charges as finance charges, which makes sense when all transactions are generally assumed to involve use of credit.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>But because hybrid prepaid-credit cards by their nature involve consumer assets as well as use of credit, bifurcating the asset feature from the credit feature makes application of the credit card rules more intuitive in a number of respects. For example, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) above, it provides a structure by which general transaction fees that are imposed in the same amount for any transaction conducted on the prepaid account—regardless of whether there are sufficient positive funds in the account—to be excluded from the finance charge. This both makes the program easier for the prepaid account issuer to operate and easier for the consumer to understand, so that the finance charge reflects the costs associated with the use of credit. As discussed above, this implementation is also more generally consistent with comments received in response to the proposed rule that urged the Bureau to include only differentiated and unique fees imposed when credit is extended in the definition of finance charge, rather than also including fees that are the same for purely positive balance transactions.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Bifurcating the two features also will make it easier to apply standard credit card requirements, such as periodic statements requirements and no-offset rules in the prepaid context. Specifically, the periodic statement requirements in § 1026.7(b)(1) and (10) (which implement TILA section 127(b)(1) and (8) respectively) require card issuers to disclose for each billing cycle both the outstanding balance in the account at the beginning of statement period and the outstanding balance in the account at the end of the period.&lt;footnote ref="708"&gt;15 U.S.C. 1637(b)(1) and (8).&lt;/footnote&gt;
             In addition, because of the offset restrictions in final § 1026.12(d) (which implements TILA section 169) &lt;footnote ref="709"&gt;15 U.S.C. 1666h(a).&lt;/footnote&gt;
             and the due date and 21-day timing requirements for periodic statements in final § 1026.7(b)(11)and in final § 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A) (which implement TILA sections 127(b)(12) and (o) and TILA section 163 respectively),&lt;footnote ref="710"&gt;15 U.S.C. 1637(b)(12), and (o) and 1666b.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             incoming deposits to the asset feature of the prepaid account could not be applied automatically to repay the negative balance on the asset balance of the prepaid account when those incoming deposits are received. Instead, with respect to a covered separate credit feature accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit card, a card issuer (1) is required to adopt reasonable procedures designed to ensure that periodic statements for the covered separate credit features are mailed or delivered at least 21 days prior to the payment due date disclosed on the periodic statement, and the due date disclosed must be the same day of the month for each billing cycle; and (2) can move funds automatically from the asset account held by the card issuer to the covered separate credit feature held by the card issuer to pay some or all of the credit card debt on the covered separate credit feature no more frequently than once per month, such as on the payment due date (pursuant to the consumer's signed, written agreement that the issuer may do so). Even if card issuers were able to identify methods of satisfying those requirements that were technically compliant with the credit card rules using a negative balance account structure, the Bureau believes that consumers would have a harder time understanding the operation of their accounts and their rights under such a system.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, the Bureau believes that use of its authority under TILA section 105(a) to add the provisions in new § 1026.61(b) is necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of TILA to help ensure the informed use of the credit or charge card account. Specifically, TILA section 102 provides that one of the main purposes of TILA is to promote the informed use of credit by ensuring meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that consumers will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available and avoid the uninformed use of credit.&lt;footnote ref="711"&gt;15 U.S.C. 1601.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             The Bureau believes that requiring credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards to be structured as separate credit features will promote the purposes of TILA by ensuring that Regulation Z's periodic statement disclosures are clear to consumers and that card issuers are complying with the offset restrictions and due date requirements in TILA in a manner that is transparent to consumers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau recognizes under this requirement, card issuers will be required after the final rule becomes effective to structure any overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner as a separate credit feature, except to the extent that overdraft credit feature meets the conditions set forth in new § 1026.61(a)(4). To the extent a prepaid account issuer has been offering overdraft credit as a negative balance on prepaid accounts prior to these rules becoming effective, the prepaid account issuer will need to restructure its overdraft credit feature as a separate credit feature if the overdraft credit feature does not meet the conditions set forth in new § 1026.61(a)(4). Nonetheless, as discussed above, the Bureau believes that bifurcating the two accounts is likely to make it easier for card issuers to comply with the Regulation Z requirements, such as the periodic statement and offset provisions discussed above, that will apply to the overdraft credit feature once the final rule becomes effective and facilitate consumers' understanding of the operation of their accounts and their rights with respect to each account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>To provide additional clarity on the provisions in new § 1026.61(b), new comment 61(b)-1 provides that if a credit feature that is accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card is structured as a subaccount of the prepaid account, the credit feature must be set up as a separate balance on the prepaid account such that there are at least two balances on the prepaid account—the asset account balance and the credit account balance.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 61(b)-2 provides guidance on how a card issuer may comply with the requirement in new § 1026.61(b). New comment 61(b)-2.i provides that if at the time a prepaid card transaction is initiated there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account to complete the transaction, credit must be drawn, transferred, or authorized to be drawn or transferred from the covered separate credit feature at the time the transaction is authorized. The card issuer may not allow the asset feature on the prepaid account to become negative and draw or transfer the credit from the covered separate credit feature at a later time, such as at the end of the day. The card issuer must comply with the applicable provisions of this regulation with respect to the credit extension from the time the prepaid card transaction is authorized. Because of the offset prohibition set forth in final § 1026.12(d) and the due date and 21-day timing requirements for periodic statements in final § 1026.7(b)(11) and in final § 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A) respectively, incoming deposits to the asset feature of the prepaid account could not be applied automatically to repay the negative balance on the asset balance of the prepaid account when those incoming deposits are received. Thus, new comment 61(b)-2.i makes clear that a card issuer may not allow the asset feature on the prepaid account to become negative and draw or transfer the credit from the covered separate credit feature at a later time, such as at the end of the day, to ensure that the card issuer is complying with these Regulation Z provisions in a manner that is clear to consumers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 61(b)-2.ii provides that for transactions where there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the transaction at the time it settles, and the prepaid transaction either was not authorized in advance or the transaction was authorized and there were sufficient or available funds in the prepaid account at the time of authorization to cover the transaction, credit must be drawn from the covered separate credit feature to settle these transactions. The card issuer may not allow the asset feature on the prepaid account to become negative. The card issuer must comply with the applicable provisions of this regulation from the time the transaction is settled.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 61(b)-2.iii provides that if a negative balance would result on the asset feature in circumstances other than those described in new comment 61(b)-2.i and ii, credit must be drawn from the covered separate credit feature to avoid the negative balance. The card issuer may not allow the asset feature on the prepaid account to become negative. The card issuer must comply with the applicable provisions in this regulation from the time credit is drawn from the covered separate credit feature. For example, assume that a fee for an ATM balance inquiry is imposed on the prepaid account when there are insufficient or unavailable funds to cover the amount of the fee when it is imposed. Credit must be drawn from the covered separate credit feature to avoid a negative balance. The Bureau expects that the card issuer will make it clear to consumers in the credit arrangement that credit will be drawn from the covered separate credit feature to avoid a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account, including if applicable for fees imposed on the prepaid account where there are insufficient or unavailable funds to cover the amount of the fee when it is imposed.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1026.60(a)(5) provides several exceptions to the requirements in existing § 1026.60 to provide cost disclosures on or with credit or charge card applications or solicitations. Specifically, existing § 1026.60(a)(5) provides that existing § 1026.60 does not apply to: (1) Home-equity plans accessible by a credit or charge card that are subject to the requirements of existing § 1026.40; (2) overdraft lines of credit tied to asset accounts accessed by check-guarantee cards or by debit cards; (3) lines of credit accessed by check-guarantee cards or by debit cards that can be used only at ATMs; (4) lines of credit accessed solely by account numbers; (5) additions of a credit or charge card to an existing open-end plan; (6) general purpose applications, unless the application, or material accompanying it, indicates that it can be used to open a credit or charge card account; or (7) consumer-initiated requests for applications. These exemptions are not specifically listed in TILA section 127(c).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In 1989, to implement the disclosure provisions in TILA section 127(c) as amended by the Fair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act of 1988,&lt;footnote ref="686"&gt;Public Law 100-583, 102 Stat. 2960.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             the Board exempted the following credit card accounts from the disclosure requirements set forth in its § 226.5a (which are contained in the Bureau's existing Regulation Z § 1026.60): (1) Home equity plans accessible by a credit or charge card that are subject to the Home Equity Loan Consumer Protection Act of 1988, Public Law 100-709; (2) overdraft lines of credit tied to asset accounts accessed by check guarantee cards or by debit cards; or (3) lines of credit accessed by check guarantee cards or by debit cards that can be used only at ATMs.&lt;footnote ref="687"&gt;54 FR 13855, 13857 (Apr. 6, 1989).&lt;/footnote&gt;
             In the supplemental information to that rulemaking, the Board indicated that a number of commenters raised issues concerning coverage of the proposed rule given the broad definition of the term “credit card” in the regulation.&lt;footnote ref="688"&gt;&amp;lt;em data-original="E-03"&amp;gt;Id.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&lt;/footnote&gt;
             Among other things, the Board reported that commenters argued that congressional intent was to require disclosures only for “traditional” credit card accounts used primarily to purchase goods and services, and not for other types of accounts that do not fall within such a category or for which the use of a credit or charge card as an access device is merely incidental to the product being offered.&lt;footnote ref="689"&gt;&amp;lt;em data-original="E-03"&amp;gt;Id.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&lt;/footnote&gt;
          </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In 1990, the Board added commentary to its Regulation Z § 226.5a (now existing § 1026.60) to provide that the disclosures set forth in its Regulation Z § 226.5a also did not apply to: (1) Lines of credit accessed solely by account numbers; (2) the addition of a credit or charge card to an existing open-end plan; (3) general purpose applications unless the application, or material accompanying it, indicates that it can be used to open a credit or charge card account; or (4) consumer-initiated requests for applications.&lt;footnote ref="690"&gt;&amp;lt;em data-original="E-03"&amp;gt;See&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; 55 FR 13103, 13107 (Apr. 9, 1990).&lt;/footnote&gt;
             In the supplemental information to the 1990 rulemaking, the Board did not explain why it was including these exemptions.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, existing § 1026.60(a)(5)(iv) currently provides that the disclosure requirements in existing § 1026.60 do not apply to lines of credit accessed solely by account numbers. The proposal would have amended existing § 1026.60(a)(5)(iv) to provide that this exception does not apply where the account number is a credit card where extensions of credit are permitted to be deposited directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. Under the proposal, these account numbers would have been credit cards. Thus, under the proposal, a card issuer would have been required to provide the disclosures required by existing § 1026.60 on or with a solicitation or application to open a credit or charge card account that would have been accessed by an account number that is a credit card where extensions of credit are permitted to be deposited directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive any comments on proposed § 1026.60(a)(5)(iv). As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) above, the Bureau is not adopting proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(vii) and proposed comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.G, which would have made these account numbers into credit cards under Regulation Z.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Nonetheless, the Bureau is revising the proposed changes to § 1026.60(a)(5)(iv) to refer to an account number that is a hybrid prepaid-credit card, rather than an account number where extensions of credit are permitted to be deposited directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. Specifically, the Bureau is revising the exemption in existing § 1026.60(a)(5)(iv) that relates to lines of credit accessed solely by account numbers so that this exception would not apply to a covered separate credit feature solely accessible by an account number that is a hybrid prepaid-credit card, as defined in new § 1026.61.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau noted in the proposal that a card issuer generally would be required to provide the cost disclosures in existing § 1026.60 on or with solicitations or applications to open a credit or charge card account that is accessed by a prepaid card that is a credit card. Consistent with the intent of the proposal, the Bureau is revising the exemption in existing § 1026.60(a)(5)(iv) to make clear that the cost disclosures in existing § 1026.60 must be provided on or with solicitations or applications to open a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card even when that hybrid prepaid-credit card is solely an account number.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 and a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau does not believe that it is appropriate to except a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card that is solely an account number from the disclosure requirements set forth in TILA section 127(c). The Bureau believes that the cost disclosures in final § 1026.60 would be helpful to consumers in deciding whether to open such a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>12(a)(2)</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1026.12(a) provides that regardless of the purpose for which a credit card is to be used, including business, commercial, or agricultural use, no credit card shall be issued to any person except: (1) In response to an oral or written request or application for the card; or (2) as a renewal of, or substitute for, an accepted credit card. Existing comments 12(a)(2)-5 and -6 provide guidance on the exception to the unsolicited issuance rule when a card is issued as a renewal of, or substitute for, an accepted credit card.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Specifically, existing comment 12(a)(2)-5 (the so-called “one for one” rule) provides that an accepted card generally may be replaced by no more than one renewal or substitute card. For example, the card issuer may not replace a credit card permitting purchases and cash advances with two cards, one for the purchases and another for the cash advances. Existing comment 12(a)(2)-6 provides, however, two exceptions to this general “one for one” rule. First, existing comment 12(a)(2)-6.i provides that the unsolicited issuance rule in existing § 1026.12(a) does not prohibit the card issuer from replacing a debit/credit card with a credit card and another card with only debit functions (or debit functions plus an associated overdraft capability) because the latter card could be issued on an unsolicited basis under Regulation E. Existing comment 12(a)(2)-6.ii also provides that existing § 1026.12(a) does not prohibit a card issuer from replacing an accepted card with more than one renewal or substitute card, provided that: (1) No replacement card accesses any account not accessed by the accepted card; (2) for terms and conditions required to be disclosed in account-opening disclosures under existing § 1026.6, all replacement cards are issued subject to the same terms and conditions, except that a creditor may vary terms for which no change-in-terms notice is required under existing § 1026.9(c); and (3) under the account's terms the consumer's total liability for unauthorized use with respect to the account does not increase.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Under the proposal, the example in existing comment 12(a)(2)-6.ii would have been moved to proposed comment 12(a)(2)-6.iii. The proposal also would have added comment 12(a)(2)-6.ii to explain that the one-for-one rule would not prevent an issuer from replacing a single card that is both a prepaid card and a credit card with two cards—one card that is a credit card and another card that is a separate prepaid card, where the latter card is not a credit card. In addition, under the proposal, the example in comment 12(a)(2)-6.i related to debit cards would have been revised for clarity; no substantive changes would have been intended.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comments on the proposed revision to existing comment 12(a)(2)-6. The Bureau is adopting this comment as proposed, with revisions as discussed below. First, the Bureau is revising the example in existing comment 12(a)(2)-6.i related to debit cards for clarity; no substantive changes are intended. Second, the Bureau is moving existing comment 12(a)(2)-6.ii to final comment 12(a)(2)-6.iii.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Third, the Bureau is adopting comment 12(a)(2)-6.ii as proposed with revisions to use consistent terminology with new § 1026.61. Specifically, the Bureau is adding new comment 12(a)(2)-6.ii to provide that the one-for-one rule does not prevent an issuer from replacing a single card that is both a prepaid card and a credit card with two cards—one card that is a credit card and one card that is a separate prepaid card where the latter card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 and a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>12(a)(1) Addition of a Credit Feature</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Under the proposal, a prepaid card could not have accessed automatically a credit feature that would make the prepaid card into a credit card at the time the card is purchased by the consumer at point of sale. A card issuer could have added a credit card feature to a prepaid card only in response to a consumer's explicit request or application.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The proposal would have modified existing comment 12(a)(1)-2 specifically to explain that the addition of a credit card feature to an existing prepaid card constitutes “issuance” for purposes of unsolicited issuance under existing § 1026.12(a). Specifically, the existing comment 12(a)(1)-2 provides that if the consumer has a non-credit card, the addition of credit features to the card (for example, the granting of overdraft privileges on a checking account when the consumer already has a check guarantee card) constitutes issuance of a credit card. The proposal would have revised existing comment 12(a)(1)-2 to provide guidance relating to prepaid cards. Specifically, proposed comment 12(a)(1)-2 would have provided that if the consumer has a non-credit card, including a prepaid card, the addition of a credit feature or plan to the card that would make the card into a credit card under § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) constitutes issuance of a credit card. The proposal also would have added an example related to prepaid cards. Specifically, the proposal would have added proposed comment 12(a)(1)-2.ii to provide that allowing a prepaid card to access a credit plan that would make the card into a credit card under § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) would constitute issuance of a credit card. The existing example relating to check guarantee cards would have been moved to proposed comment 12(a)(1)-2.i.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive any specific comments on the proposed revisions to existing comment 12(a)(1)-2. The Bureau is adopting comment 12(a)(1)-2 as proposed, with revisions to be consistent with new § 1026.61. Consistent with the proposal, the final rule revises existing comment 12(a)(1)-2 to provide that if the consumer has a non-credit card, including a prepaid card, the addition of a credit feature or plan to the card that would make the card into a credit card under § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) constitutes issuance of a credit card. The final rule also moves the existing example related to check guarantee cards to final comment 12(a)(1)-2.i. The final rule also adds a new example in final comment 12(a)(1)-2.ii to provide that issuance of a credit card includes allowing a prepaid card to access a covered separate credit feature that would make the card into a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61 with respect to the covered separate credit feature. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 and a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Issuance of a Non-Credit Card</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Existing comment 12(a)(1)-7.i explains that a non-credit card may be sent on an unsolicited basis by an issuer that does not propose to connect the card to any credit plan.&lt;footnote ref="642"&gt;The Bureau notes that a prepaid card is an access device under Regulation E, as that term is defined in existing Regulation E § 1005.2(a)(1), and is subject to the issuance rules set forth in existing Regulation E § 1005.5. See also the commentary to final § 1005.18(a).&lt;/footnote&gt;
             The comment states that a credit feature may be added to a previously issued non-credit card only upon the consumer's specific request. Existing comment 12(a)(1)-7.ii provides as an example, that a purchase-price discount card may be sent on an unsolicited basis by an issuer that does not propose to connect the card to any credit plan. The comment further explains that an issuer demonstrates that it proposes to connect the card to a credit plan by, for example, including promotional materials about credit features or account agreements and disclosures required by § 1026.6. The comment also states that the issuer violates the rule against unsolicited issuance if, for example, at the time the card is sent a credit plan can be accessed by the card or the recipient of the unsolicited card has been preapproved for credit that the recipient can access by contacting the issuer and activating the card.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Under the proposal, the current language of existing comment 12(a)(1)-7.i and ii would have been moved to proposed comment 12(a)(1)-7.i.A and B respectively and would have been limited to the issuance of non-credit cards that are not prepaid cards. The proposal also would have added comment 12(a)(1)-7.ii to provide guidance on when the issuance of a prepaid card would be viewed as the issuance of a credit card. Specifically, proposed comment 12(a)(1)-7.ii would have provided that existing § 1026.12(a)(1) would not apply to the issuance of a prepaid card where an issuer does not connect the card to any credit plan that would make the prepaid card into a credit card at the time the card is issued and only opens a credit card account, or provides an application or solicitation, to open a credit or charge card account, that would be accessed by that card in compliance with proposed § 1026.12(h) (which has been moved to new § 1026.61(c) in the final rule). As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(c) below, the Bureau proposed to add § 1026.12(h) to require a card issuer to wait at least 30 days after the prepaid account has been registered before opening a credit card account for the holder of the prepaid account that will be accessed by the prepaid card, or providing a solicitation or an application to the holder of the prepaid account to open a credit or charge card account that will be accessed by the prepaid card. Proposed comment 12(a)(1)-7.ii also would have explained that a credit feature may be added to a previously issued prepaid card only upon the consumer's specific request and only in compliance with proposed § 1026.12(h).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 12(a)(1)-7.ii further would have explained, however, that an issuer does not make a prepaid card into a credit card simply by providing the disclosures required by proposed Regulation E § 1005.18(b)(2)(i)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;9&lt;/em&gt;) and (ii)(B) with the prepaid card. As discussed in the section-by-section analyses of Regulation E § 1005.18(b)(2)(x) and (4)(vii) above, under the proposal, a financial institution would have been required to provide certain disclosures about credit card accounts that may be offered in connection with prepaid accounts. Under the proposal, a financial institution would have been required to disclose in the short form and long form disclosures provided in connection with the prepaid account certain information about any credit plan that may be offered at any point to the holder of the prepaid account where the credit plan would be accessed by a credit card that also is a prepaid card. These disclosures would have enabled consumers to shop more effectively for prepaid accounts by informing them of both whether a credit card account may be offered in connection with the prepaid account and some of the terms of such a credit card account. Proposed comment 12(a)(1)-7.ii would have provided guidance that providing these disclosures would not have violated the rule against unsolicited issuance of a credit card because, otherwise, selling such cards in retail locations or otherwise providing them on an unsolicited basis to consumers would violate Regulation Z if these required disclosures were included with the prepaid card.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive any specific comments on proposed comment 12(a)(1)-7.ii. As technical revisions, consistent with the proposal, the final rule moves the current language of existing comment 12(a)(1)-7.i and ii to final comment 12(a)(1)-7.i.A and B respectively and limits this language to the issuance of non-credit cards that are not prepaid cards.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also is adopting new comment 12(a)(1)-7.ii as proposed, with revisions to be consistent with new § 1026.61. New comment 12(a)(1)-7.ii provides that existing § 1026.12(a)(1) does not apply to the issuance of a prepaid card where an issuer does not connect the card to any covered separate credit feature that would make the prepaid card into a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in § 1026.61 at the time the card is issued and only opens a covered separate credit feature, provides an application or solicitation to open a covered separate credit feature, or allows an existing credit feature to become a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61 in compliance with new § 1026.61(c). As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 and a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 12(a)(1)-7.ii also clarifies that a covered separate credit feature may be added to a previously issued prepaid card only upon the consumer's application or specific request and only in compliance with new § 1026.61(c). This comment clarifies that an issuer does not make a prepaid card into a hybrid prepaid-credit card simply by providing the disclosures required by Regulation E § 1005.18(b)(2)(x), (4)(iv), and (vii) with the prepaid card. In addition, the comment provides a cross-reference to existing § 1026.12(a)(2) and related commentary for when a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in § 1026.61 may be issued as a replacement or substitute for another hybrid prepaid-credit card. The comment also provides a cross-reference to existing Regulation E § 1005.5 and final § 1005.18(a), and related commentary, that govern the issuance of access devices under Regulation E.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>60(b)(8) Cash Advance Fee</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1026.60(b)(8), which implements TILA section 127(c)(1)(B)(i), generally requires that card issuers disclose on or with solicitations or applications to open credit or charge card accounts any fee imposed for an extension of credit in the form of cash or its equivalent.&lt;footnote ref="694"&gt;15 U.S.C. 1637(c)(1)(B)(i).&lt;/footnote&gt;
          </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The proposal would have added proposed comment 60(b)(8)-4 to provide guidance on when fees would be considered cash advance fees that must be disclosed under existing § 1026.60(b)(8) for credit card accounts that are accessed by prepaid cards. In addition, proposed comment 60(b)(8)-4 would provide guidance on how cash advance fees must be disclosed. Specifically, proposed comment 60(b)(8)-4 would have provided that if a card issuer assesses a fee (other than a periodic rate that may be used to compute the finance charge on an outstanding balance) for a cash advance accessed by a credit card that is a prepaid card, such as a cash withdrawal at an ATM, that fee is a cash advance fee. Under proposed comment 60(b)(8)-4, if the cash advance fee is the same dollar amount as the transaction charge for purchases described in existing § 1026.60(b)(4), the card issuer could have disclosed the fee amount under a heading that indicates the fee applies to both purchase transactions and cash advances. Proposed comment 60(b)(8)-4 would have provided the following three examples of how cash advance fees must be disclosed.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Under proposed comment 60(b)(8)-4.i, the first example would have provided that a card issuer assesses a $15 fee for credit accessed by a credit card that is a prepaid card to purchase goods or services at the point of sale when the consumer has insufficient or unavailable funds in the prepaid account. Under this proposed example, the card issuer assesses a $25 fee for credit accessed by a prepaid card for a cash advance at an ATM when the consumer has insufficient or unavailable funds in the prepaid account. In this instance, under the proposal, the card issuer could have disclosed separately a purchase transaction charge of $15 and a cash advance fee of $25.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Under proposed comment 60(b)(8)-4.ii, the second example would have provided that a card issuer assesses a $15 fee for credit accessed by a credit card that is a prepaid card to purchase goods or services at the point of sale when the consumer has insufficient or unavailable funds in the prepaid account. Under this proposed example, the card issuer also assesses a $15 fee for credit accessed by a credit card that is a prepaid card for providing cash at an ATM when the consumer has insufficient or unavailable funds in the prepaid account. In this instance, under the proposal, the card issuer could have disclosed the $15 fee under a heading that indicates the fee applies to both purchase transactions and ATM cash advances. Alternatively, under the proposal, the card issuer could have disclosed the $15 fee on two separate rows, with one row indicating that a $15 fee applies to purchase transactions, and a second row indicating that a $15 fee applies to ATM cash advances.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Under proposed comment 60(b)(8)-4.iii, the third example would have provided that a card issuer assesses a $15 fee for credit accessed by a credit card that is a prepaid card for providing cash at an ATM when the consumer has insufficient or unavailable funds in the prepaid account. The card issuer also assesses a fee of $1.50 for out-of-network ATM cash withdrawals and $1.00 fee for in-network ATM cash withdrawals. The card issuer must disclose the cash advance fee as $16.50 for out-of-network ATM cash withdrawals, indicating that $1.50 is for the out-of-network ATM withdrawal fee, such as “$16.50 (including a $1.50 out-of-network ATM withdrawal fee).” The card issuer also could have disclosed the cash advance fee as $16.00 for in-network ATM cash withdrawals, indicating that $1.00 is for the in-network ATM withdrawal fee, such as “$16 (including a $1.00 in-network ATM cash withdrawal fee).”</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive specific comments on this aspect of the proposal. The Bureau is adopting proposed comment 60(b)(8)-4 as proposed with technical revisions to clarify the intent of the comment and to be consistent with final § 1026.8 and new § 1026.61.&lt;footnote ref="695"&gt;The proposal would have provided that the term “credit card” includes an account number that is not a prepaid card that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan that allows deposits directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. Proposed comment 60(b)(8)-5 would have provided guidance on when fees will be considered cash advance fees under § 1026.60(b)(8) with respect to credit card accounts accessed by such accounts numbers. For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) above, the final rule does not adopt proposed comment 60(b)(8)-5 related to these account numbers.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             New comment 60(b)(8)-4.i provides that with respect to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined by new § 1026.61, if a card issuer assesses a fee (other than a periodic rate that may be used to compute the finance charge on an outstanding balance) for a cash advance, such as a cash withdrawal at an ATM, where this fee is imposed as part of the plan as described in § 1026.6(b)(3), that fee is a cash advance fee. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 and a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For the reasons discussed in the section-by-section analyses of §§ 1026.8 and 1026.60(a)(4), new comment 60(b)(8)-4.i also provides that a fee for a transaction will be treated as a cash advance fee under final § 1026.60(b)(8) in cases where a consumer uses a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61 to make a purchase to obtain goods or services from a merchant, and credit is transferred from a covered separate credit feature accessed by the hybrid prepaid-credit card into the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the amount of the purchase. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See also&lt;/em&gt; new comment 60(b)(4)-3.iii. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.8(a) above, this guidance in new comment 60(b)(8)-4.i is consistent with guidance for disclosing those credit transactions as “nonsale credit” on Regulation Z periodic statements under final §§ 1026.7(b)(2) and 1026.8(b) with respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 60(b)(8)-4.ii also provides that if the cash advance fee is the same dollar amount as the transaction charge for purchases described in final § 1026.60(b)(4), the card issuer may disclose the fee amount under a heading that indicates the fee applies to both purchase transactions and cash advances. Consistent with proposed comment 60(a)(8)-4, new comment 60(a)(8)-4.ii provides examples of how fees for purchase transactions described in final § 1026.60(b)(4) and fees for cash advances described in final § 1026.60(b)(8) that are charged on the covered separate credit feature must be disclosed.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>60(b)(4) Transaction Charges</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1026.60(b)(4), which implements TILA section 127(c)(1)(A)(ii)(III), generally requires that card issuers disclose on or with solicitations or applications to open credit or charge card accounts any transaction charge imposed on purchases.&lt;footnote ref="693"&gt;15 U.S.C. 1637(c)(1)(A)(ii)(III).&lt;/footnote&gt;
             The proposal would have added proposed comment 60(b)(4)-3 to provide guidance on when fees would be considered transaction fees for purchases under existing § 1026.60(b)(4) for prepaid cards that are credit cards. Specifically, proposed comment 60(b)(4)-3 would have provided that if a card issuer assesses a fee (other than a periodic rate that may be used to compute the finance charge on an outstanding balance) for credit accessed by a credit card that is a prepaid card to make a purchase, that fee is a transaction charge as described in existing § 1026.60(b)(4). Proposed comment 60(b)(4)-3 also would have provided that such fees must be disclosed as transaction charges under existing § 1026.6(b)(4) whether the fee is a flat per transaction fee to make a purchase, a flat fee for each day (or other period) the consumer has an outstanding balance of purchase transactions, or a one-time fee for transferring funds from the consumer's credit account to the consumer's prepaid account to cover the shortfall in the prepaid account as a result of a purchase with the prepaid card.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive specific comments on this aspect of the proposal. The Bureau is adopting proposed comment 60(b)(4)-3 with revisions to be consistent with §§ 1026.8 and 1026.61. New comment 60(b)(4)-3.i provides that with respect to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined by new § 1026.61, if a card issuer assesses a fee (other than a periodic rate that may be used to compute the finance charge on an outstanding balance) to make a purchase where this fee is imposed as part of the plan as described in final § 1026.6(b)(3), that fee is a transaction charge described in final § 1026.60(b)(4). This is true whether the fee is a per transaction fee to make a purchase or a flat fee for each day (or other period) the consumer has an outstanding balance of purchase transactions. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 and a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>With respect to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, new comment 60(b)(4)-3.ii provides guidance on whether a fee must be disclosed as a fee for a purchase transaction under final § 1026.60(b)(4) or a cash advance transaction under final § 1026.60(b)(8). New comment 60(b)(4)-3.ii provides that a fee for a transaction will be treated as a fee to make a purchase under final § 1026.60(b)(4) in cases where a consumer uses a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61 to make a purchase to obtain goods or services from a merchant, and credit is drawn directly from a covered separate credit feature accessed by the hybrid prepaid-credit card without transferring funds into the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the amount of the purchase. For example, assume that the consumer has $10 of funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account and initiates a transaction with a merchant to obtain goods or services with the hybrid prepaid-credit card for $25. In this case, $10 is debited from the asset feature and $15 of credit is drawn directly from the covered separate credit feature accessed by the hybrid prepaid-credit card without any transfer of funds into the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the amount of the purchase. A per transaction fee imposed for the $15 credit transaction must be disclosed under final § 1026.60(b)(4).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.8(a) above, this guidance in new comment 60(b)(4)-3.ii is consistent with guidance for disclosing those credit transactions as “sale credit” on Regulation Z periodic statements under final §§ 1026.7(b)(2) and 1026.8(a) with respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In contrast, new comment 60(b)(4)-3.iii provides that a fee for a transaction will be treated as a cash advance fee under final § 1026.60(b)(8) in cases where a consumer uses a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61 to make a purchase to obtain goods or services from a merchant, and credit is transferred from a covered separate credit feature accessed by the hybrid prepaid-credit card into the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the amount of the purchase. For example, assume the same facts as above, except that the $15 will be transferred from the covered separate credit feature to the asset feature, and a transaction of $25 is debited from the asset feature of the prepaid account. In this case, a per transaction fee for the $15 credit transaction must be disclosed under final § 1026.60(b)(8).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.8(a) above, this guidance in new comment 60(b)(4)-3.iii is consistent with guidance for disclosing those credit transactions as “nonsale credit” on Regulation Z periodic statements under final §§ 1026.7(b)(2) and 1026.8(b) with respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1026.13(a) defines a “billing error” for purposes of the error resolution procedures. Under existing § 1026.13(a)(3), the term “billing error” includes disputes about an extension of credit for property or services not accepted by the consumer or not delivered to the consumer as agreed. Existing comment 13(a)(3)-2 explains that, in certain circumstances, a consumer may assert a billing error under existing § 1026.13(a)(3) with respect to property or services obtained through any extension of credit made in connection with a consumer's use of a third-party payment service.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(vii) would have provided a definition for “account number where extensions of credit are permitted to be deposited directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor.” As used in the proposal, this term would have meant an account number that is not a prepaid card that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan that allows deposits directly into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor but does not allow the consumer to deposit directly extensions of credit from the plan into asset accounts other than particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. Proposed comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.G would have provided that these account numbers were credit cards under the proposal.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Similar to the provision relating to third-party intermediaries, the proposal would have added proposed comment 13(a)(3)-2.ii to address situations where goods or services are purchased using funds deposited into a prepaid account and those funds are credit drawn from a credit plan that is accessed by an account number where extensions of credit are permitted to be deposited directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. The proposal would have moved the existing guidance in comment 13(a)(3)-2 to proposed 13(a)(3)-2.i.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive specific comments on proposed comment 13(a)(3)-2.ii. For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(15)(i), the Bureau has not adopted proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(vii) and proposed comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.G that would have made these account numbers into credit cards under Regulation Z.

      <title>61(a)(2) Prepaid Card Can Access Credit From a Covered Separate Credit Feature</title>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>In General</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau received industry comments stating that a prepaid card should not be a credit card with respect to a separate credit feature when the credit feature is offered by an unrelated third party. On the other hand, as discussed above, several consumer groups supported the proposed rule to consider a third party that offers an open-end credit feature accessed by a prepaid card to be an agent of the prepaid account issuer and thus a credit card issuer with responsibilities under Regulation Z.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau received an industry comment that the Bureau should clarify that a prepaid card should not be a credit card when the prepaid card could be used to initiate the load or transfer of credit to the prepaid account, but this load or transfer could not occur in order to process transactions conducted with the card when there were insufficient funds in the prepaid account to cover the amount of the transaction. On the other hand, as discussed above, several consumer group commenters suggested that the credit card rules should apply to a credit account even if the credit account did not function as an overdraft credit feature with respect to a prepaid account, so long as credit from the credit account was deposited into the prepaid account. These consumer group commenters indicated that the Bureau should apply the credit card rules to all credit transferred to a prepaid account, even if there is another way to access the credit.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Another consumer group commenter indicated that the Bureau should apply the credit card rules to all open-end lines of credit where credit may be deposited or transferred to prepaid accounts if either (1) the creditor is the same institution as or has a business relationship with the prepaid issuer; or (2) the creditor reasonably anticipates that a prepaid card will be used as an access device for the line of credit. Nonetheless, this commenter said that the final rule should not impact a completely unrelated credit account that has no connection to prepaid issuers or consumers identified as prepaid card users, even though the creditor allows credit to be transferred from the credit account through the ACH system.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail below, under the final rule, new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i)(A) defines a separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as described in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i) as a covered separate credit feature. Under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i)(A), a prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a separate credit feature (and the separate credit feature is a covered separate credit feature) when it is a single device that can be used from time to time to access the separate credit feature where the following two conditions are both satisfied: (1) The card can draw, transfer, or authorize the draw or transfer of credit from the separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; and (2) the separate credit feature is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. As discussed in more detail below, new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i)(B) provides that a separate credit feature that meets the two conditions set forth above is a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card even with respect to credit that is drawn or transferred, or authorized to be drawn or transferred, from the credit feature outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail below, consistent with the proposal, under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i), a prepaid card is a credit card under Regulation Z (&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;i.e.,&lt;/em&gt; hybrid prepaid-credit card) with respect to a separate credit feature when the credit feature functions as an overdraft credit feature with respect to the prepaid account, and the credit feature is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. Consistent with the proposal, new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i) also captures situations where transactions can be initiated using a prepaid card where the card is a traditional “dual purpose” card. In this case, the card can be used both to access the asset feature of a prepaid account and to draw on the covered separate credit feature independent of whether there are sufficient or available funds in the asset feature to complete the transaction.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Under the final rule, a prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card when it can access credit from a covered separate credit feature as described in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i), even if finance charges are not charged in relation to this credit. As discussed above, under the proposal, a prepaid card would not have been a credit card under § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) if the prepaid card only accesses credit that is not subject to any finance charge, as defined in § 1026.4, or fee described in § 1026.4(c), and is not payable by written agreement in more than four installments. One consumer group commenter expressed concern that the exclusion of prepaid cards from the definition of credit card if the prepaid card only accesses credit that is not subject to a finance charge, as defined in § 1026.4, or a fee described § 1026.4(c) would lead to evasions. For example, this commenter was concerned that a prepaid issuer could offer a “deluxe” prepaid card that comes with $100 in “free” overdraft protection but recover the costs for the credit through other fees charged on the credit account that are not finance charges or fees described in § 1026.4(c), such as higher fees for purportedly “voluntary” credit insurance that is not a finance charge or fee described in § 1026.4(c). This commenter urged the Bureau to cover all prepaid cards as a credit card when the prepaid card accesses credit, regardless of whether a finance charge or a fee described under § 1026.4(c) is imposed for the credit. This commenter recognized, however, that exceptions for force pay transactions and payment cushions may be necessary.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>To address these concerns, the Bureau provides that a prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a covered separate credit feature when it meets the two conditions set forth in § 1026.61(a)(2)(i), regardless of whether finance charges are imposed in connection with the credit from the covered separate credit feature. The Bureau believes that the final rule is consistent with the intent of the proposal and the definition of “credit card” under Regulation Z, which applies to “charge cards” and other credit products meeting the regulatory definitions even if they do not involve finance charges.&lt;footnote ref="701"&gt;Specifically, Regulation Z defines the term “credit card” to mean “any card, plate, or other single credit device that may be used from time to time to obtain credit.” &amp;lt;em data-original="E-03"&amp;gt;See&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; § 1026.2(a)(15)(i). In addition, under Regulation Z, a card issuer (or its agent) offering credit is a &amp;amp;#8220;creditor&amp;amp;#8221; under § 1026.2(a)(17)(iii) for purposes of the provisions in subpart B of the regulation, regardless of whether a finance charge is imposed for the credit.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             In proposing not to apply the credit card rules in situations in which a prepaid card only accesses credit that is not subject to any finance charge, as defined in § 1026.4, or any fee described in § 1026.4(c), and is not payable by written agreement in more than four installments, the Bureau intended to provide this exception only with respect to credit extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account. In the proposal, the Bureau stated its belief that this type of credit, where no credit-related fees are imposed, is more properly regulated under Regulation E as credit incidental to the prepaid card transaction. See the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(4) below for a description of the exception that is contained in the final rule.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With regard to covered separate credit features, however, the same logic does not apply. Not all credit extensions accessing separate credit features via a prepaid card would be subject to Regulation E protections if Regulation Z did not apply. Rather, Regulation E would apply to credit extensions that are deposited in a prepaid account by use of an EFT, but it would not apply to extensions of credit where the transaction does not involve an EFT to or from the prepaid account. The final rule also is consistent with the definition of “credit card” under Regulation Z, which does not require that finance charges be charged for the credit in order for a device to meet the definition of “credit card.”</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also believes that considering a prepaid card to be a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a covered separate credit feature when it meets the two conditions set forth in § 1026.61(a)(2)(i), regardless of whether finance charges are imposed in connection with the credit from the covered separate credit feature, also would help prevent card issuers from structuring their fees to recover the cost of credit through fees that are not finance charges to avoid triggering the credit card rules. The Bureau believes that this will help promote transparency and consumers understanding of the costs of credit.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Thus, the final rule provides that a prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a covered separate credit feature, as defined in § 1026.61(a)(2)(i), regardless of whether finance charges are imposed for the credit from the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Covered Separate Credit Features</title>
        <analysisParagraph>New § 1026.61(a)(2)(i)(A) provides that a prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a separate credit feature when it is a single device that can be used from time to time to access the separate credit feature and the following two conditions are both satisfied: (1) The card can be used to draw, transfer, or authorize the draw or transfer of credit from the separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; and (2) the separate credit feature is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. Under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i)(A), a separate credit feature that is accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card is a covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New § 1026.61(a)(2)(i)(B) provides that a separate credit feature that meets the conditions set forth above is a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card even with respect to credit that is drawn or transferred, or authorized to be drawn or transferred, from the credit feature outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. In developing these rules, the Bureau was conscious that there were two distinct types of credit extensions that could occur with respect to a covered separate credit feature. The first type of credit extension is where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. The second type of credit extension is where a consumer makes a standalone draw or transfer of credit from the covered separate credit feature, outside the course of any transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. For example, a consumer may use the prepaid card at the prepaid account issuer's Web site to load funds from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. The Bureau believes that if the prepaid card is capable of accessing the separate credit feature in the two conditions set forth in § 1026.61(a)(2)(i), the covered separate credit feature is a credit card account under Regulation Z, even with respect to draws or transfers of credit from the covered separate credit feature that occur outside the course of any transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or service, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. This is consistent with other provisions in Regulation Z that apply the credit card rules to the credit card account generally, even with respect to transactions that are not conducted with the credit card, such as convenience check transactions. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; §§ 1026.52(a) and (b) and 1026.55 and related commentary, and § 1026.12(d)(1) and comment 12(d)(1)-3.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i), a hybrid prepaid-credit card that can access a covered separate credit feature, as defined in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i), is a credit card under Regulation Z with respect to that covered separate credit feature. In this case, the hybrid prepaid-credit card can access both the covered separate credit feature and the asset feature of the prepaid account. New comment 61(a)(2)-1.i provides that for a prepaid card to be a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i) with respect to a separate credit feature, the prepaid account must be structured such that the draw or transfer of credit, or authorizations of either, from a separate credit feature offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner is capable of occurring in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the prepaid card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct a P2P transfer. In this case, the separate credit feature is a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 61(a)(2)-1.ii makes clear a prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a covered separate credit feature regardless of whether (1) the credit is pushed from the covered separate credit feature to the asset feature of the prepaid account in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; or (2) the credit is pulled from the covered separate credit feature to the asset feature of the prepaid account in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. This provision prevents a prepaid account issuer from evading the credit card provisions of Regulation Z by structuring the transactions as a push of credit funds to the prepaid account (as opposed to a pull of credit funds from the separate credit feature) during the course of a particular prepaid account transaction to prevent the transaction from taking the prepaid account balance negative.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 61(a)(2)-1.iii makes clear that a prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a covered separate credit feature regardless of whether the covered separate credit feature can only be used as an overdraft credit feature, solely accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card, or whether it is a general line of credit that can be accessed in other ways.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 61(a)(2)-2 provides guidance on when a draw, transfer, or authorization of a draw or transfer occurs within the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers, as described in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i). Specifically, new comment 61(a)(2)-2.i provides that a draw, transfer, or authorization from a separate credit feature is deemed to be in the “course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing” a transaction if it occurs during the authorization phase of the transaction or in later periods up to the settlement of the transaction. This comment makes clear that a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner in connection with a prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 61(a)(2)-2.ii focuses on situations in which the credit is drawn, transferred, or authorized to be drawn or transferred in the course of authorizing a transaction. New comment 61(a)(2)-2.ii makes clear that under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i), a prepaid card is a “hybrid prepaid-credit card” with respect to a separate credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner in cases, for example, where (1) transactions can be initiated using a prepaid card when there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account at the time the transaction is initiated, and credit is transferred from the credit feature to the asset feature at the time the transaction is authorized to complete the transaction; and (2) transactions can be initiated using a prepaid card when there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account at the time the transaction is initiated and credit is directly drawn from the credit feature to complete the transaction, without transferring funds into the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 61(a)(2)-2.iii provides illustrations of transactions in which credit is drawn, transferred, or authorized to be drawn or transferred in the course of settling a transaction. For example, under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i), a prepaid card is a “hybrid prepaid-credit card” with respect to such a separate credit feature in cases where credit can be automatically drawn, transferred, or authorized to be drawn or transferred from the separate credit feature at the time of settlement where there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the original transaction with the card.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 61(a)(2)-3 clarifies that in addition to overdraft credit features, new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i) also covers a prepaid card as a hybrid prepaid-credit card (and thus a credit card under Regulation Z) where the card is a traditional “dual purpose” card. In this case, a prepaid card can be used from time to time both to access the asset feature of a prepaid account and to draw on the covered separate credit feature in the course of a transaction independent of whether there are sufficient or available funds in the asset feature to complete the transaction. For example, assume that a consumer has $50 in funds in her prepaid account. The consumer initiates a $25 transaction with the card to purchase goods and services. If the consumer chooses at the time the transaction is initiated to use the card to access the prepaid account, the card will draw on the funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account to complete the transaction. If the consumer chooses at the time the transaction is initiated to use the card to access the covered separate credit feature, the card will draw on credit from the credit feature to complete the transaction, regardless of the fact that there were sufficient or available funds the prepaid account to complete the transaction.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 61(a)(2)-4.i clarifies that new § 1026.61 and other provisions in Regulation Z related to hybrid prepaid-credit cards use the terms “covered separate credit feature” or “covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card” to refer to a separate credit feature that meets the conditions of new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i). &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; final §§ 1026.4(c)(4), 1026.7(b)(11)(ii)(A), 1026.12(d)(3)(ii), 1026.60(a)(5)(iv), and 1026.60(b). In addition, new comment 61(a)(2)-4.i also states that several provisions in Regulation Z also describe this arrangement as one where a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, as defined in new § 1026.61. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; final §§ 1026.4(b)(11), 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D), and 1026.13(i)(2).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 61(a)(2)-4.ii provides guidance on new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i)(B), which provides that a separate credit feature that meets the two conditions set forth in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i)(A) is a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card even with respect to credit that is drawn or transferred, or authorized to be drawn or transferred, from the credit feature outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or service, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. New comment 61(a)(2)-4.ii clarifies that if a prepaid card is capable of drawing or transferring credit, or authorizing either, from a separate credit feature offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the prepaid card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct a P2P transfer, the credit feature is a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, even with respect to credit that is drawn or transferred, or authorized to be drawn or transferred, from the credit feature outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. For example, with respect to a covered separate credit feature, a consumer may use the prepaid card at the prepaid account issuer's Web site to load funds from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. This credit transaction is considered a credit transaction on a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, even though the load or transfer of funds occurred outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. As discussed above, the Bureau believes that if the prepaid card is capable of accessing the separate credit feature in the two conditions set forth in § 1026.61(a)(2)(i), the covered separate credit feature is a credit card account under Regulation Z, even with respect to draws or transfers of credit from the covered separate credit feature that occur outside the course of any transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Non-Covered Separate Credit Features</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, in order for a separate credit feature to be a “covered separate credit feature” accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, the separate credit feature must meet the following two conditions set forth in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i): (1) The card can be used from time to time to access credit from the separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; and (2) the separate credit feature is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii) defines the term “non-covered separate credit feature” to mean a separate credit feature that does not meet these two conditions. Under § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii), a prepaid card that accesses credit from a non-covered separate credit feature is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to this non-covered separate credit feature, even if the prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a covered separate credit feature as described above. A non-covered separate credit feature is not subject to the rules applicable to hybrid prepaid-credit cards; however, it typically will be subject to Regulation Z depending on its own terms and conditions, independent of the connection to the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 61(a)(2)-5.i clarifies that a separate credit feature is a “non-covered separate credit feature” when the separate credit feature is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. This is true even if the separate credit feature functions as an overdraft credit feature with respect to the prepaid account. For example, assume a consumer links her prepaid account to a credit card issued by a card issuer that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner so that credit is drawn automatically into the asset feature of the prepaid account in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the prepaid card for which there are insufficient funds in the asset feature. In this case, the separate credit feature is a non-covered separate credit feature under § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii). In this situation, the prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to the separate credit feature offered by the unrelated third-party card issuer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 61(a)(2)-5.ii clarifies that a separate credit feature is a “non-covered separate credit feature” if a prepaid card cannot access the separate credit feature during the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. This is true even if the separate credit feature is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. For example, assume that a consumer can only conduct a draw or transfer of credit, or authorization of either, from a separate credit feature to a prepaid account at the prepaid account issuer's Web site, and these draws, transfers, or authorizations of either, cannot occur in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions at the Web site to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. In this case, the separate credit feature is a non-covered separate credit feature under § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii). In this situation, the prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under § 1026.61(a)(2) with respect to this non-covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 61(a)(2)-5.iii explains that a person offering a non-covered separate credit feature does not become a card issuer under final § 1026.2(a)(7), and thus does not become a creditor under final § 1026.2(a)(17)(iii) or (iv), because the prepaid card can be used to access credit from the non-covered separate credit feature. The person offering the non-covered separate credit feature, however, may already have obligations under Regulation Z with respect to that separate credit feature. For example, if the non-covered separate credit feature is an open-end credit card account offered by an unrelated third-party creditor that is not an affiliate or business partner of the prepaid account issuer, the person already will be a card issuer under final § 1026.2(a)(7) and thus a creditor under final § 1026.2(a)(17)(iii). Nonetheless, in that case, the person does not need to comply with the provisions in Regulation Z applicable to hybrid prepaid-credit cards even though the prepaid card can access credit from the non-covered separate credit feature. The obligations under Regulation Z that apply to a non-covered separate credit feature are not affected by the fact that the prepaid card can access credit from the non-covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Each of the two types of non-covered separate credit features is discussed in more detail below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Non-covered separate credit feature where a prepaid card can access a separate credit feature that is not offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner.&lt;/em&gt; As discussed above, the Bureau received comments from industry stating that a prepaid card should not be a credit card with respect to a separate credit feature when the credit feature is offered by an unrelated third-party. These commenters were concerned that an unrelated third party may not be aware when its credit feature is used as an overdraft credit feature with respect to a prepaid account. If unrelated third parties that offer separate credit features were subject to the provisions applicable to hybrid prepaid-credit cards, these third parties would face additional compliance risk in connection with the prepaid card becoming a new access device for the credit account. This would have been true even if the third parties were already subject to the credit card rules in their own right because the proposal contained a number of provisions that would have applied only to prepaid cards that are credit cards and would not have applied to credit card accounts generally.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In contrast, several consumer groups supported the proposed rule to consider a third party that offers an open-end credit feature accessed by a prepaid card to be an agent of the prepaid account issuer and thus a credit card issuer with responsibilities under Regulation Z.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Based on the comments, the Bureau believes it is appropriate not to trigger status as a hybrid prepaid-credit card where a credit feature is not offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner, even if an individual consumer decides to link the two accounts such that a draw or transfer of credit, or authorization of either, occurs during the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to a third party offering a separate credit feature that is neither an affiliate nor a business partner of the prepaid account issuer, the Bureau recognizes that this unrelated third party may not be aware when its credit feature is used as an overdraft credit feature with respect to a prepaid account. If unrelated third parties were subject to the provisions applicable to hybrid prepaid-credit cards, such third parties would face additional compliance risk in connection with the prepaid card becoming a new access device for the credit account. This can occur when the prepaid account issuer uses the ACH network to execute an authorization from a consumer to pull credit for a consumer from a separate credit account offered by an unrelated third party. Financial institutions participating in the ACH network may have difficulty specifically identifying and blocking pulls of credit by a prepaid account (and, unlike with credit/debit cards, the prepaid account issuer likely would have no way of knowing if the account and routing number a consumer provides for ACH purposes accesses a deposit account or a credit account). Moreover, because an ACH debit pull may be used to access credit from accounts that are not subject to the current credit card rules in their own right, the Bureau is concerned that unrelated third parties offering separate credit features would face even more challenges if the pull (or the ability to initiate pulls) triggered credit card compliance obligations.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also is concerned that unrelated third parties that are already subject to the credit card rules in their own right also may be unwilling to assume that compliance risk due to the prepaid account issuer's actions in linking a separate credit feature offered by an unrelated third party to a prepaid account to be used as an overdraft credit feature. As a result, the Bureau is concerned that credit card networks could prevent prepaid account issuers from being merchants in the network for all purposes because credit card issuers would not want to be subject to the enhanced obligations in Regulation Z that would apply if a prepaid card were deemed to be a credit card with respect to a credit card account offered by an unrelated third party. The Bureau believes that this rule will reduce the risk that unrelated third parties offering separate credit features would take the steps described above, which could harm consumers by making prepaid accounts less widely usable by consumers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Thus, the final rule does not consider a prepaid card to be a credit card under the regulation in relation to a separate credit feature where an unrelated third party that is not an affiliate or business partner of the prepaid account issuer offers the credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In contrast, the Bureau does believe that it is appropriate to consider a prepaid card to be a credit card when it can access an overdraft credit feature that is offered by a third party where the third party is the prepaid account issuer's affiliate or its business partner. As discussed further below in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(5), new § 1026.61(a)(5)(i) defines the term “affiliate” for purposes of § 1026.61 and other provisions in Regulation Z related to hybrid prepaid-credit cards to mean any company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another company, as set forth in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1841 &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;et seq.&lt;/em&gt;).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed further below in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(5), new § 1026.61(a)(5)(iii) defines the term “business partner” for purposes of § 1026.61 and other provisions in Regulation Z related to hybrid prepaid-credit cards generally to mean a person (other than the prepaid account issuer or its affiliates) that can extend credit through a separate credit feature where either (1) the person that can extend credit or its affiliate has an agreement with the prepaid account issuer or its affiliate that the prepaid card can access the separate credit feature in the course of a transaction; or (2) the person that can extend credit or its affiliate has a cross-marketing agreement or other similar arrangement with the prepaid account issuer or its affiliate and where, whether or not by agreement, the prepaid card can access the separate credit feature in the course of a transaction.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that it is appropriate to consider such an unaffiliated third party that can extend credit to be the prepaid account issuer's business partner in the above circumstances because in those cases, there is a sufficient connection between the parties such that the unaffiliated third party should know that its credit feature is accessible by a prepaid card as a credit feature for the prepaid account. Also, the Bureau believes that these types of links between the prepaid account issuer and the unaffiliated third party are likely to involve revenue sharing or payments between the two companies and the pricing structure of the two accounts may be related. Thus, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to consider these entities to be business partners in this context.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that the approach described above of not covering a prepaid card as a credit card with respect to a separate credit feature when it is offered by a third party that is not an affiliate or business partner of the prepaid account issuer addresses the concerns discussed above about unintended consequences for consumers and third parties alike, while appropriately guarding against the risk that third parties offering separate credit features or their affiliates would cooperate with prepaid account issuers or their affiliates to attempt to evade the intended scope of the rules regarding overdraft credit features.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Non-covered separate credit feature where prepaid card can access separate credit feature only outside the course of a transaction.&lt;/em&gt; One issuing credit union expressed concerned that the proposal would have triggered the credit card rules in situations in which a prepaid card could be used only to complete standalone loads or transfers of credit from a separate credit feature to the prepaid account, but not to access credit in the course of a transaction conducted with the prepaid card. This commenter noted that consumers can consciously load value to their prepaid account using their debit card or credit card, where the load is not part of an overdraft feature offered in connection with the prepaid account. When using the debit card, the consumer may consciously load funds from an overdraft or line of credit product that is linked to a traditional checking account. When using a credit card, the consumer is loading from an available credit card balance to fund the prepaid account. This commenter urged the Bureau to clarify that such loads do not make the prepaid card into a credit card under Regulation Z.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several consumer group commenters suggested that the credit card rules should apply to a credit account even if the credit account did not function as an overdraft credit feature with respect to a prepaid account, so long as credit from the credit account was deposited into the prepaid account. These consumer group commenters indicated that the Bureau should apply the credit card rules to all credit transferred to a prepaid account, even if there is another way to access the credit.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Another consumer group commenter indicated that the Bureau should apply the credit card rules to all open-end lines of credit where credit may be deposited or transferred to prepaid accounts if either (1) the creditor is the same institution as or has a business relationship with the prepaid issuer; or (2) the creditor reasonably anticipates that a prepaid card will be used as an access device for the line of credit. Nonetheless, this commenter said that the final rule should not impact a completely unrelated credit account that has no connection to prepaid issuers or consumers identified as prepaid card users, even though the creditor allows credit to be transferred from the credit account through the ACH system.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In the final rule, the Bureau is clarifying the circumstances in which a prepaid card is a credit card from the proposal to address circumstances in which credit can only be loaded or transferred from a separate credit feature to the prepaid account outside the course of completing a transaction conducted with the prepaid card. Under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii), even if a separate credit feature is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner, a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61(a)(2) with respect to that separate credit feature if the feature cannot be accessed within the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. For example, assume that a consumer can only conduct a draw or transfer of credit, or authorization of either, from a separate credit feature to a prepaid account at the prepaid account issuer's Web site, and these draws, transfers, or authorizations of either, cannot occur in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions at the Web site to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. In this case, the separate credit feature is a non-covered separate credit feature under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii), and the prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61(a)(2) with respect to this non-covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to this type of non-covered separate credit feature, the separate credit feature cannot function as an overdraft credit feature with respect to the prepaid account. In addition, the prepaid card also cannot function as a traditional “dual purpose” card where the card can be used both to access the asset feature of a prepaid account and to draw on the separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers independent of whether there are sufficient or available funds in the asset feature to complete the transaction. Instead, the prepaid card can only be used to draw or transfer credit from the separate credit feature on an occasional and intentional basis, outside the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. The Bureau believes that this situation is somewhat less risky for consumers because consumers would be required to make a deliberate decision to access the credit outside the course of a transaction, and thus can separately evaluate the tradeoffs involved. The Bureau also believes that this clarification is consistent with the proposal's general focus on covering overdraft credit features offered in connection with prepaid accounts as credit card accounts under Regulation Z.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, in adopting this approach, the Bureau is drawing on the same logic and maintaining consistency with the existing credit card rules' treatment of overdraft lines of credit that can be accessed by debit cards. Under the existing rules as set forth in existing comments 2(a)(15)-2.i.B and 2(a)(15)-2.ii.A., debit cards are generally treated as credit cards under existing § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) when they access overdraft lines of credit (where there is an agreement to extend credit). In addition, the term “credit card” also includes a deposit account number even when there is no physical debit card device when the account number can be used to access an open-end line of credit to purchase goods or services. Nonetheless, under the current definition of credit card as set forth in existing comment 2(a)(15)(i)-2.ii.C, a deposit account number is not a credit card if the account number can only be used as a destination for the transfer of money from a separate credit account.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Prepaid Card Can Access Multiple Separate Credit Features</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau recognizes that a prepaid card may access multiple separate credit features in a variety of circumstances. New § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii) and new comment 61(a)(2)-6 clarify coverage under new § 1026.61(a)(2) when a prepaid card can access multiple separate credit features. New § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii) and new comment 61(a)(2)-6 provide that even if a prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a covered separate credit feature, it is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to any non-covered separate credit features. New comment 61(a)(2)-6 provides the following example to illustrate: Assume that a prepaid card can access “Separate Credit Feature A” where the card can be used from time to time to access credit from a separate credit feature that is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. In addition, assume that the prepaid card also can access “Separate Credit Feature B,” but that credit feature is offered by an unrelated third-party creditor that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to “Separate Credit Feature A” because it is a covered separate credit feature under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i). The prepaid card, however, is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to “Separate Credit Feature B” because it is a non-covered separate credit feature under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>57(c) Prohibited Inducements</title>
      <analysisParagraph>TILA section 140(f)(2) provides that no card issuer or creditor may offer to a student at an institution of higher education any tangible item to induce such student to apply for or participate in an open-end consumer credit plan offered by such card issuer or creditor, if such offer is made: (1) On the campus of an institution of higher education; (2) near the campus of an institution of higher education, as determined by rule of the Bureau; or (3) at an event sponsored by or related to an institution of higher education.&lt;footnote ref="683"&gt;15 U.S.C. 1650(f)(2).&lt;/footnote&gt;
             This TILA provision is implemented in existing § 1026.57(c), which provides that no card issuer or creditor may offer a college student any tangible item to induce such student to apply for or open an open-end consumer credit plan offered by such card issuer or creditor, if such offer is made: (1) On the campus of an institution of higher education; (2) near the campus of an institution of higher education; or (3) at an event sponsored by or related to an institution of higher education.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed to add comment 57(c)-7 to explain that existing § 1026.57(c) applies to (1) the application for or opening of a credit card account that is being added to previously-issued prepaid accounts that were issued to full-time or part-time students, where that credit account would be accessed by a prepaid card that is a credit card; or (2) the application for or opening of a prepaid account where a credit account may be added in connection with the prepaid account where that credit account may be accessed by a prepaid card that is a credit card.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comments on this aspect of the proposal. The Bureau is adopting proposed comment 57(c)-7 with revisions to be consistent with new § 1026.61.&lt;footnote ref="684"&gt;The proposal would have provided that the term “credit card” includes an account number that is not a prepaid card that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan that allows deposits directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. The proposal would have provided in comment 57(c)-7 guidance on how the prohibition in § 1026.57(c) applies to credit card accounts that are accessed by these account numbers. For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) above, the final rule does not adopt the proposed changes to comment 57(c)-7 related to these account numbers.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             New comment 57(c)-7 provides that final § 1026.57(c) applies to (1) the application for or opening of a covered separate credit feature that is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in § 1026.61 that is being added to a prepaid account as defined as § 1026.61 previously issued to a full-time or part-time student as well as (2) the application for or opening of a prepaid account where a covered separate credit feature that is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in § 1026.61 may be added in the future to the prepaid account. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 and a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that the marketing efforts related to a prepaid account, including the inducements given by a card issuer to open a prepaid account, may have an impact on whether consumers may request that a covered separate credit feature that is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card be linked to the prepaid account, as discussed above, when such covered separate credit features are offered to them. Thus, any tangible item given to induce college students to apply for or open a prepaid account where a covered separate credit feature that is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card may be added in connection with the prepaid account would also be interpreted as an inducement to encourage a college student to apply for or open such a covered separate credit feature in connection with the prepaid account. As a result, under final § 1026.57(c), a card issuer or creditor would be prohibited from offering a college student any tangible item to induce the student to apply for or open a prepaid account offered by the card issuer or creditor where a covered separate credit feature that is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card may be added in connection with the prepaid account, if the offer is made: (1) On the campus of an institution of higher education; (2) near the campus of an institution of higher education; or (3) at an event sponsored by or related to an institution of higher education.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>60(b) Required Disclosures</title>
      <analysisParagraph>TILA section 127(c), implemented by existing § 1026.60, generally requires card issuers to provide certain cost disclosures on or with an application or solicitation to open a credit or charge card account.&lt;footnote ref="691"&gt;15 U.S.C. 1637(c).&lt;/footnote&gt;
             Under existing § 1026.60, card issuers generally are required to provide the following disclosures, among other cost disclosures, on or with the applications or solicitations for credit cards: (1) The APRs applicable to the account for purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers; (2) any annual or other periodic fee, expressed as an annualized amount, that is imposed for the issuance or availability of a credit card, including any fee based on account activity or inactivity; (3) any non-periodic fees related to opening the account, such as one-time membership or participation fees; (4) any minimum or fixed finance charge that could be imposed during a billing cycle; (5) any transaction charge imposed on purchases, cash advances, or balance transfers; (6) any late payment fees, over the limit fees, or returned payment fees; (7) whether a grace period on purchases applies; (8) the name of the balance computation method used to determine the balance for purchases; (9) any fees for required insurance, debt cancellation, or debt suspension coverage; (10) if the fees imposed at account opening are 15 percent or more of the minimum credit limit for the card, disclosures about the available credit that will remain after those fees are imposed; and (11) a reference to the Bureau's Web site where consumers may obtain information about shopping for and using credit cards.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Under existing § 1026.60(b), charge card issuers generally are required to provide the above disclosure on or with the applications or solicitations for charge cards, except that a charge card issuer is not required to disclose: (1) The APRs applicable to the account for purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers; (2) any minimum or fixed finance charge that could be imposed during a billing cycle; (3) whether a grace period on purchases applies; (4) the name of the balance computation method used to determine the balance for purchases; (5) any fees for required insurance, debt cancellation, or debt suspension coverage; and (6) if the fees imposed at account opening are 15 percent or more of the minimum credit limit for the card, disclosures about the available credit that will remain after those fees are imposed.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not propose any changes to existing § 1026.60(b) or its related commentary. One consumer group commenter indicated that with respect to credit card accounts that will be accessed by a prepaid card that is a charge card, the Bureau should require disclosure of the following items in the table required to be provided on or with applications or solicitations: (1) Any minimum or fixed finance charge that could be imposed during a billing cycle; (2) any fees for required insurance, debt cancellation, or debt suspension coverage; and (3) if the fees imposed at account opening are 15 percent or more of the minimum credit limit for the card, disclosures about the available credit that will remain after those fees are imposed. This commenter believed that unlike traditional charge cards, prepaid cards that are charge cards have a significant possibility of imposing fixed finance charges; offering credit insurance, debt cancellation, or debt suspension; or having fees in excess of the 15 percent threshold for the credit availability disclosure.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail below, the Bureau is revising existing § 1026.60(b) to provide that with respect to a covered separate credit feature that is a charge card account accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61, a charge card issuer must provide the above three disclosures.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In addition, as discussed in more detail below, new comment 60(b)-3 provides guidance on the application of the disclosure requirements in existing § 1026.60(b) to fees or charges imposed on a covered separate credit feature or an asset feature that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. The final rule also adds new comment 60(b)-4 to provide that the disclosures in final § 1026.60(b) do not apply to fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account with respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards when the fees or charges are not “charges imposed as part of the plan” under new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D) with respect to the covered separate credit feature. New comment 60(b)-4 also provides that the disclosures in final § 1026.60(b) do not apply to fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account with respect to a non-covered separate credit feature. The Bureau believes this additional guidance in new comments 60(b)-3 and -4 is needed given the changes in the final rule to the definition of “finance charge” in final § 1026.4, the definition of “charges imposed as part of the plan” in final § 1026.6(b)(3), and the addition of new § 1026.61.</analysisParagraph>

As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under § 1026.61 and a credit card under § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>TILA section 127(c)(5) states that the Bureau may, by regulation, require the disclosure of information in addition to that otherwise required by 127(c), and modify any disclosure of information required by 127(c), in any application or solicitation to open a charge card account for any person, if the Bureau determines that such action is necessary to carry out the purposes of, or prevent evasions of, any paragraph of this subsection. The Bureau believes that use of its authority under TILA section 105(a) and 127(c)(5) to amend § 1026.60(b) to require such charge card issuers to provide these three disclosures is necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of TILA to help ensure the informed use of covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards that are charge cards. Specifically, TILA section 102 provides that one of the main purposes of TILA is to promote the informed use of credit by ensuring meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that consumers will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available and avoid the uninformed use of credit.&lt;footnote ref="692"&gt;15 U.S.C. 1601.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             In addition, the Bureau believes that requiring these three disclosures for covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards that are charge cards will, consistent with Dodd-Frank Act section 1032(a), ensure that the terms of these charge card accounts are fully, accurately, and effectively disclosed to consumers in a manner that permits consumers to understand the costs, benefits, and risks associated with the charge card account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that these disclosures may be more helpful for covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards that are charge cards than they would be for traditional charge card accounts. Traditional charge card accounts typically require charge cardholders to repay the charge card balance in full each month. Thus, the required credit insurance, debt cancellation, or debt suspension disclosures typically would not apply to these accounts because the cardholders are not allowed to revolve charge card balances. In addition, traditional charge card accounts are generally targeted to more creditworthy individuals. Thus, these charge cards typically have a higher credit limit and typically do not charge fees for credit availability that exceed 15 percent of the initial credit line. Traditional charge card issuers also typically do not impose fixed finance charges.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Nonetheless, the Bureau believes that covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards that are charge cards may more likely be targeted to consumers with lower credit scores than credit card users overall and the card issuer may not require that charge card balances be repaid in full each month. Thus, in these cases, charge card issuers may be more likely to charge fixed finance charges; require credit insurance, debt cancellation, or debt suspension products; or charge fees for credit availability that might exceed the 15 percent threshold. Thus, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to apply these disclosures when a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card that is a charge card is opened.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Fee Imposed on the Asset Feature of the Prepaid Account</title>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards.&lt;/em&gt; As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 and a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New § 1026.61(b) generally requires that such credit features be structured as separate subaccounts or accounts, distinct from the prepaid asset account, to facilitate transparency and compliance with various Regulation Z requirements. Nonetheless, the final rule characterizes certain fees or charges that are imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account as finance charges in connection with a covered separate credit feature where both the asset feature and the credit feature are accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) above, new § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) provides that with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61, fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account generally are finance charges only to the extent that the amount of the fee or charge exceeds comparable fees or charges imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.6 above, the final rule also clarifies that with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61, fees or charges imposed on the asset feature that are not finance charges also are not “charges imposed as part of the plan” with respect to the covered separate credit feature.
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Given this guidance in the final rule related to fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, new comment 60(b)-3 provides that with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in § 1026.61, a card issuer is required to disclose under final § 1026.60(b) any fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account that are charges imposed as part of the plan under final § 1026.6(b)(3) to the extent those fees or charges fall within the categories of fees or charges required to be disclosed under final § 1026.60(b). For example, assume that a card issuer imposes a $1.25 per transaction fee on the asset feature of a prepaid account for purchases when a hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses a separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing purchase transactions conducted with the card, and the card issuer charges $0.50 per transaction for purchases to access funds in prepaid accounts in the same program without such a credit feature. In this case, the $0.75 excess is a charge imposed as part of the plan under final § 1026.6(b)(3) and must be disclosed under final § 1026.60(b)(4).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>To facilitate compliance with the disclosure requirements in § 1026.60, new comment 60(b)-4 provides that a card issuer is not required under final § 1026.60(b) to disclose any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account that is not a charge imposed as part of the plan under new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D) with respect to the covered separate credit feature. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.6 above, under new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D) and new comment 6(b)(3)(iii)(D)-1, a fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account is not a “charge imposed as part of the plan” to the extent that the amount of the fee or charge does not exceed comparable fees or charges imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have a credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. As described in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) above, these fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are not finance charges under new § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii). The Bureau believes that the guidance in new comment 60(b)-3 aids compliance with final § 1026.60 by providing additional clarity to card issuers on how the disclosure requirements in final § 1026.60(b) apply to fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analyses of §§ 1026.4 and 1026.6 above, the Bureau believes that fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account that are not finance charges (and thus, not charges imposed as part of the plan under new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D)) with respect to the covered separate credit feature are more appropriately regulated under Regulation E, rather than regulated under Regulation Z, with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Non-covered separate credit features.&lt;/em&gt; As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, new § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii) provides that a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a “non-covered separate credit feature,” which means that the separate credit feature either (1) cannot be accessed in the course of a prepaid card transaction to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; or (2) is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. A non-covered separate credit feature is not subject to the rules applicable to hybrid prepaid-credit cards; however, it typically will be subject to Regulation Z depending on its own terms and conditions, independent of the connection to the prepaid account. Thus, a non-covered separate credit feature may be subject to the disclosure requirements in § 1026.60 in its own right.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to non-covered separate credit features that are subject to § 1026.60, new comment 60(b)-4 provides that the disclosure requirements in final § 1026.60 do not apply to any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account that is not a charge imposed as part of the plan under new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(E) with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature. Under new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(E) and new comment 60(b)(3)(iii)(E)-1, with respect to a non-covered separate credit feature as defined in new § 1026.61, none of the fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are “charges imposed as part of the plan” under final § 1026.6(b)(3) with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature. New comment 6(b)(3)(iii)(E)-1 also cross-references comment 4(b)(11)-1.ii.B which provides that none of the fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are finance charges under final § 1026.4 with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature. Thus, a card issuer of a non-covered separate credit feature would not be required to disclose any fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account under final § 1026.60(b) with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analyses of §§ 1026.4 and 1026.6 above, the Bureau believes that fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account are more appropriately regulated under Regulation E, rather than regulated under Regulation Z, with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>2(a)(15)(i) Credit Card</title>
      <analysisParagraph>TILA section 103(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;l&lt;/em&gt;) defines “credit card” to mean any card, plate, coupon book, or other credit device existing for the purpose of obtaining money, property, labor, or services on credit.&lt;footnote ref="599"&gt;15 U.S.C. 1602(&amp;lt;em data-original="E-03"&amp;gt;l&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;).&lt;/footnote&gt;

             Regulation Z defines the term “credit card” in existing § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) to mean “any card, plate, or other single credit device that may be used from time to time to obtain credit.” Current comment 2(a)(15)-2 provides examples of devices that are credit cards and devices that are not credit cards. A person that issues credit cards or the person's agent is a “card issuer” and must comply with certain credit card provisions in Regulation Z, as applicable. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; existing §§ 1026.12 and 1026.60; for card issuers offering a “credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan,” &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;see, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; existing §§ 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A), 1026.7(b)(11), and 1026.51 through 1026.59. Any card issuer that extends credit also is a creditor under Regulation Z and must comply with certain disclosure and other requirements in Regulation Z, as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(17) below. The proposal would have provided guidance on when the following devices related to prepaid accounts are “credit cards:” (1) Prepaid cards, as defined in proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(v) to mean any card, code, or other device that can be used to access a “prepaid account,” as defined in proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(vi) consistent with proposed Regulation E; and (2) account numbers that are not prepaid cards that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan that allows deposits directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor but does not allow consumers to deposit directly extensions of credit from the plan into asset accounts other than particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor, as defined in proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(vii). Each of these circumstances is discussed in more detail below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Hybrid Prepaid-Credit Cards</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Under the proposal, credit plans, including overdraft services and overdraft lines of credit, that are directly accessed by prepaid cards generally would have been credit card accounts under Regulation Z. In particular, proposed comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.F would have provided that the term “credit card” includes a prepaid card (including a prepaid card that is solely an account number) that is a single device that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan, except if that prepaid card only accesses credit that is not subject to any finance charge, as defined in § 1026.4, or any fee described in § 1026.4(c), and is not payable by written agreement in more than four installments. A prepaid card that is solely an account number would have been a credit card if it satisfied the requirements of proposed comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.F. The proposal would have revised existing comment 2(a)(15)-2.ii.C that provides guidance on when account numbers are credit cards. The proposal would have revised existing comment 2(a)(15)-2.ii.C to provide that the current guidance for when a prepaid card is a credit card is set forth in proposed comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.F, rather than in comment 2(a)(15)-2.ii.C. As discussed below and in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61, the Bureau is revising from the proposal the circumstances in which a prepaid card is a credit card under Regulation Z (&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;i.e.,&lt;/em&gt; a hybrid prepaid-credit card). See the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61 for a detailed description of the proposal to define prepaid cards as credit cards, the comments received on the proposal to define prepaid cards as credit cards, and the circumstances in which the final rule defines a prepaid card as a hybrid prepaid-credit card.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is making conforming revisions to existing § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) to provide that the term “credit card” includes a hybrid prepaid-credit card, as defined in § 1026.61. In addition, the Bureau is revising new comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.F from the proposal to provide that the term “credit card” includes a prepaid card that is a hybrid prepaid-credit card, as defined in new § 1026.61. The Bureau also is adding new comment 2(a)(15)-2.ii.D to provide that the term “credit card” does not include a prepaid card that is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card, as defined in new § 1026.61. The Bureau also is revising existing comment 2(a)(15)-2.ii.C that provides guidance on when account numbers are credit cards. The Bureau is revising this comment to provide that the rules in new § 1026.61 and related commentary determine when a hybrid prepaid-credit card that solely is an account number is a credit card, as discussed in new comment 61(a)(1)-2.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, if a person issues a prepaid card that is a hybrid prepaid-credit card, the person is a “card issuer” under final § 1026.2(a)(7) with respect to the prepaid card. In addition, with respect to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, an affiliate or business partner offering the credit feature (if applicable) also is a “card issuer” under final § 1026.2(a)(7). Under existing § 1026.2(a)(17)(iii) and (iv), the person also is a “creditor” if the card issuer extends credit under a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card as described above. If the card issuer extends open-end (not home-secured) credit, the person generally would need to comply with the open-end (not home-secured) rules set forth in subpart B and the credit card rules set forth in subparts B and G. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(20) below, the Bureau believes that prepaid account issuers, their affiliates, or their business partners that offer covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards will be creditors offering open-end (not home-secured) credit under Regulation Z. See the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(17) below for a discussion of situations in which a creditor may not be offering open-end credit in relation to a prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Account Numbers That Are Not Prepaid Cards</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Currently, under comment 2(a)(15)-2.ii.C, an account number for a credit plan is a credit card when that account number can access an open-end line of credit to purchase goods or services. For example, if a creditor provides a consumer with an open-end line of credit that can be accessed by an account number in order to transfer funds into another account (such as an asset account with the same creditor), the account number is not a credit card. However, if the account number also can access the line of credit to purchase goods or services (such as an account number that can be used to purchase goods or services on the internet), the account number is a credit card, regardless of whether the creditor treats such transactions as purchases, cash advances, or some other type of transaction.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;The Bureau's proposal.&lt;/em&gt; The Bureau proposed not to follow the current guidance in existing comment 2(a)(15)-2.ii.C in the context of credit accessed in connection with prepaid accounts. Instead, proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(vii) would have included within the definition of credit card an “account number where extensions of credit are permitted to be deposited directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor.” As used in the proposal, this term would have meant an account number that is not a prepaid card that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan that allows deposits directly into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor but does not allow the consumer to deposit directly extensions of credit from the plan into asset accounts other than particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.G would have provided that these account numbers were credit cards under the proposal. In addition, the proposal would have revised existing comment 2(a)(15)-2.ii.C to provide that the current guidance for when an account number is a credit card under Regulation Z would not have applied to these account numbers, as described in proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(vii) and proposed comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.G. Proposed comment 2(a)(15)-5 would have provided additional guidance on these account numbers. Specifically, proposed comment 2(a)(15)-5 would have provided that a credit plan that permits a consumer to deposit directly extensions of credit into a checking account would not constitute a credit plan where extensions of credit are permitted to be deposited directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. Nonetheless, under proposed comment 2(a)(15)-5, a credit plan accessible by a consumer through checks or in-person withdrawals would have constituted a credit plan where extensions of credit are permitted to be deposited directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor, so long as the credit plan allowed deposits directly into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor but did not allow the consumer to deposit directly extensions of credit into other asset accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to account numbers where extensions of credit are permitted to be deposited directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor, the proposed rule would have covered credit plans that are not accessed directly by prepaid cards but are structured as “push” accounts. For example, such a credit plan may allow a consumer to use an account number to request an extension of credit be deposited directly into a particular prepaid account specified by the creditor when the consumer does not have adequate funds in the prepaid account to cover the full amount of a transaction using the prepaid card. In the proposal, the Bureau expressed concern that these types of credit plans could act as substitutes for credit plans directly accessible by a prepaid card. The Bureau did not, however, propose to cover general purpose lines of credit where a consumer has the freedom to choose where to deposit directly the credit funds.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Comments received.&lt;/em&gt; Consumer group commenters indicated that the proposal with respect to push accounts was too limited. Several consumer group commenters suggested that the credit card rules should apply to a credit account even if the credit account did not function as an overdraft credit feature with respect to a prepaid account, so long as credit from the credit account was deposited into the prepaid account. These consumer group commenters indicated that the Bureau should apply the credit card rules to all credit transferred to a prepaid account, even if there is another way to access the credit.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Another consumer group commenter indicated that the Bureau should apply the credit card rules to all open-end lines of credit where credit is deposited or transferred to prepaid accounts if either (1) the creditor is the same institution as or has a business relationship with the prepaid issuer; or (2) the creditor reasonably anticipates that a prepaid card will be used as an access device for the line of credit. Nonetheless, this commenter said that the final rule should not impact a completely unrelated credit account that has no connection to prepaid issuers or consumers identified as prepaid card users, even though the creditor allows credit to be transferred from the credit account through the ACH system.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One issuing bank and one law firm writing on behalf of a coalition of prepaid issuers did not support subjecting push accounts to credit card rules. These industry commenters indicated that the Board should leave in place the rule currently in Regulation Z that determines when an account number for a credit plan is a credit card. One of these industry commenters indicated that attempting to cover push accounts as credit card accounts under the proposal would create an overly complex regulatory regime to address the perceived risk of circumvention or evasion of the rules for overdraft plans set forth in the proposal. This commenter believed the Bureau has better tools (&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; its unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices authority) to address circumvention or evasion, as well as the other risks of consumer harms discussed in the proposal.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One industry trade association commenter indicated that it would be inappropriate to treat the line of credit (or its associated account number) as a credit card when the consumer has the choice of whether to use the line of credit to cover specified overdrafts or to use the line of credit funds for other purposes. This commenter believed that the consumer's ability to choose how to use the line of credit makes it clear that the line of credit is a general use line of credit and not a substitute for an overdraft line of credit.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;The final rule.&lt;/em&gt; Upon review of the comments and its own analysis, the Bureau has decided not to adopt the proposal to provide that an account number for a credit account would be a credit card where extensions of credit are permitted to be deposited directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. In proposing these provisions, the Bureau was concerned that a prepaid account issuer and a creditor could design arrangements to circumvent the proposed rules in Regulation Z applicable to prepaid cards that are credit cards. In this case, a third-party creditor could have an arrangement with the prepaid account issuer such that credit from the credit account is pushed from the credit account to the prepaid account during the course of a particular prepaid account transaction to prevent the transaction from taking the prepaid account balance negative. These provisions related to credit account numbers were designed to prevent this type of evasion.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is addressing this type of evasion by generally covering a prepaid card as a credit card (&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;i.e.,&lt;/em&gt; “hybrid prepaid-credits card”) when the card can access a separate credit feature that functions as an overdraft credit feature and is offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. Specifically, new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i) provides that a prepaid card is a “hybrid prepaid-credit card” with respect to a separate credit feature if the card meets the following two conditions: (1) The card can be used from time to time to access credit from the separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; and (2) the separate credit feature is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. New § 1026.61(a)(2)(i) defines such a separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as a “covered separate credit feature.” Thus, the hybrid prepaid-credit card can access both the covered separate credit feature and the asset feature of the prepaid account, and the hybrid prepaid-credit card is a credit card under Regulation Z with respect to the covered separate credit feature. In this case, as described in new comment 61(a)(2)-1.ii, the prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to the covered separate credit feature regardless of whether (1) the credit is pushed from the covered separate credit feature to the asset feature of the prepaid account in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; or (2) the credit is pulled from the covered separate credit feature to the asset feature of the prepaid account in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, as described in new comment 61(a)(2)-1.iii, a prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a covered separate credit feature, as discussed above, regardless of whether the covered separate credit feature can only be used as an overdraft credit feature, solely accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card, or whether it is a general line of credit that can be accessed in other ways. For the reasons set forth in the &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z&lt;/em&gt; section, the Bureau believes that consumers will benefit from the application of the credit card rules generally to a credit account that functions as an overdraft credit feature in connection with a prepaid account when that overdraft feature is offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner, regardless of whether the credit account can be used exclusively as an overdraft credit feature. In addition, the Bureau is concerned about potential evasion if the provisions applicable to overdraft credit features could be avoided simply by providing other uses for the credit account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that the provisions in the final rule described above with respect to a covered separate credit feature adequately capture situations where a separate credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner functions as an overdraft credit feature in relation to a prepaid account. Thus, the Bureau believes that it is no longer necessary to treat a credit account number as a credit card to capture situations when the credit account may function as an overdraft credit feature in relation to the prepaid account. As a result, the Bureau has not adopted proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(vii) and proposed comments 2(a)(15)-2.i.G and 2(a)(15)-5. The Bureau also has not adopted proposed revisions to existing comment 2(a)(15)-2.ii.C related to account numbers described in proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(vii) and proposed comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.G. The Bureau proposed changes to other provisions in Regulation Z and related commentary to provide guidance on how these provisions would apply to such account numbers, which would have been credit cards under the proposal. The Bureau has not adopted these proposed changes to provisions in Regulation Z related to these account numbers.&lt;footnote ref="600"&gt;Specifically, the proposal would have revised or added the following provisions in Regulation Z related to these account numbers: §§ 1026.2(a)(15)(ii)(C)(&amp;lt;em data-original="E-03"&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;) and (vii); 1026.4(b)(2)(ii), (c)(3), and (4); 1026.7(b)(11)(ii)(A)(&amp;lt;em data-original="E-03"&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;); 1026.12(d)(3)(ii) and (h) (renumbered in the final rule as § 1026.61(c)); 1026.60(a)(5)(iv); and comments 2(a)(15)-2.i.G, 2(a)(15)-2.ii.C, 2(a)(15)-3.ii, 2(a)(15)-4.ii, 2(a)(15)-5, 2(a)(20)-2.iii, 2(a)(20)-4.ii, 4(a)-4.iv, 4(b)(2)-1.ii through iv, 4(c)(3)-1, 5(b)(2)(ii)-4, 8(b)-1.vi, 10(a)-2.ii, 12(c)(1)-1.i, 12(d)(3)-3, 13(a)(3)-2.ii, 13(i)-1, 52(a)(2)-3, 52(b)(2)(i)-7, 57(a)(1)-1, 57(a)(5)-1, 57(b)-3, 57(c)-7, and 60(b)(8)-5. The final rule does not adopt the proposed changes to these provisions related to these account numbers.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             The Bureau also proposed changes to certain provisions in Regulation E and related commentary to provide guidance on how these Regulation E provisions would apply to such account numbers. The Bureau has not adopted these proposed changes to provisions in Regulation E related to these account numbers.&lt;footnote ref="601"&gt;The proposal would have made changes to existing § 1005.10(e)(1) and comments 10(e)(1)-2 and -3 and added proposed § 1005.18(g)(1) and comments 18(g)-1 and -2 related to these account numbers. The final rule does not adopt the proposed provisions related to these account numbers.&lt;/footnote&gt;

        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, several consumer group commenters suggested that the credit card rules should apply to a credit account even if the credit account did not function as an overdraft credit feature with respect to a prepaid account, so long as credit from the credit account was deposited into the prepaid account. These consumer group commenters indicated that the Bureau should apply the credit card rules to all credit transferred to a prepaid account, even if there is another way to access the credit. Another consumer group commenter indicated that the Bureau should apply the credit card rules to all open-end lines of credit where credit is deposited or transferred to prepaid accounts if either (1) the creditor is the same institution, as or has a business relationship with, the prepaid issuer; or (2) the creditor reasonably anticipates that a prepaid card will be used as an access device for the line of credit.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above and in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61 below, the Bureau generally intends to cover under Regulation Z overdraft credit features in connection with prepaid accounts where the credit features are offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliates, or its business partners. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61 below, the Bureau also has decided to exclude prepaid cards from being covered as credit cards under Regulation Z when they access certain specified types of credit. First, under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii), a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a “non-covered separate credit feature,” which means that the separate credit feature either (1) cannot be accessed in the course of a prepaid card transaction to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers, or (2) is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. Second, under new § 1026.61(a)(4), a prepaid card also is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card when the prepaid card accesses incidental credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account where the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit. A prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 or a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) when it accesses credit from these types of credit features. For more detailed explanations of when prepaid cards are not credit cards under Regulation Z, see the section-by-section analyses of § 1026.61(a)(2) and (4) below.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Debit Cards</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.B currently provides guidance on when a debit card is a credit card, and the comment provides examples of credit cards that include “a card that accesses both a credit and an asset account (that is, a debit-credit card).” Proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(iv) would have defined the term “debit card” for purposes of Regulation Z to mean “any card, plate, or other single device that may be used from time to time to access an asset account other than a prepaid account.” The proposed definition of “debit card” also would have specified that it does not include a prepaid card. Because the term “debit card” under the proposal would not have included all cards that access asset accounts, existing comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.B would have been revised to be consistent with the proposed definition of debit card. Specifically, proposed comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.B would have been revised to provide that the term “credit card” includes a debit card (other than a debit card that is solely an account number) that also accesses a credit account (that is, a debit-credit card). This comment also would have been revised to provide a cross-reference to existing comment 2(a)(15)-2.ii.C for guidance on whether a debit card that is solely an account number is a credit card. No substantive changes were intended to the current rules for when debit cards are credit cards under existing § 1026.2(a)(15)(i).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive specific comment on this proposed definition. The Bureau is adopting the definition of “debit card” as proposed with one technical revision to provide a cross-reference to the definition of “prepaid account” in new § 1026.61. The Bureau also is adopting the changes to existing comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.B as proposed.</analysisParagraph>

The final rule also adds new comment 55(a)-4 to provide that the restrictions in final § 1026.55 do not apply to fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account with respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards when the fees or charges are not “charges imposed as part of the plan” under new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.

        <title>Covered Separate Credit Features Accessible by Hybrid Prepaid-Credit Cards</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 and a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New § 1026.61(b) generally requires that such credit features be structured as separate subaccounts or accounts, distinct from the prepaid asset account, to facilitate transparency and compliance with various Regulation Z requirements. Given this change and to ensure compliance with § 1026.55, the Bureau is adding new comment 55(a)-3 to provide guidance on when fees or charges imposed in connection with covered separate credit features are subject to the restrictions in existing § 1026.55. New comment 55(a)-3 provides that with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61 where the credit feature is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, final § 1026.55(a) prohibits card issuers from increasing an APR or any fee or charge required to be disclosed under existing § 1026.6(b)(2)(ii), (iii), or (xii) on a credit card account unless specifically permitted by one of the exceptions in existing § 1026.55(b). This is true regardless of whether these fees or APRs are imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account or on the credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>TILA section 171 and 172 apply, respectively, to any APR, fee, or finance charge applicable to any outstanding balance and to any APR, fee, or finance charge on any credit card account under an open-end consumer credit plan. Those terms readily encompass credit-related fees that are imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account. Even if the terms were ambiguous, the Bureau believes—based on its expertise and experience with respect to credit markets—that interpreting them to encompass credit-related fees imposed on the asset feature would promote the purposes of TILA to protect the consumer against inaccurate and unfair credit billing and credit card practices. From the consumer's perspective, there is no practical difference when an APR or any fee or charge described in existing § 1026.55(a) imposed in connection with a covered separate credit feature is charged against the separate credit feature and when it is charged to the asset feature of the prepaid account. If TILA sections 171 and 172 were not interpreted to include APRs or fees or charges described in existing § 1026.55(a) in connection to the covered separate credit feature when those fees or charges are imposed on the asset feature, the Bureau is concerned that card issuers could avoid the restrictions set forth in TILA sections 171 and 172 and § 1026.55(a) with respect to these fees or charges simply by imposing them on the asset feature of the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 55(a)-4 provides that with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61, final § 1026.55(a) does not apply to any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account that is not a charge imposed as part of the plan under new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D) with respect to the covered separate credit feature. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.6 above, with respect to a fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, a fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account is a “charge imposed as part of the plan” to the extent that the amount of the fee or charges exceeds comparable fees or charges imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have a credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. This fee or charge also is a finance charge under new § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Under new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D) and new comment 6(b)(3)(iii)(D)-1, a fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account is not a “charge imposed as part of the plan” to the extent that the amount of the fee or charges does not exceed comparable fees or charges imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have a credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. These fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are not finance charges under new § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) in relation to the covered separate credit feature. The Bureau believes that this guidance facilitates compliance with final § 1026.55(a) by providing additional clarity to card issuers on how the restrictions in final § 1026.55(a) apply to fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analyses of §§ 1026.4 and 1026.6 above, the Bureau believes that fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account that are not finance charges (and thus, not charges imposed as part of the plan under new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D)) with respect to the covered separate credit feature are more appropriately regulated under Regulation E, rather than regulated under Regulation Z, with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Non-Covered Separate Credit Features</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a “non-covered separate credit feature,” which means that the separate credit feature either (1) cannot be accessed in the course of a prepaid card transaction to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; or (2) is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. As described in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii), a non-covered separate credit feature is not subject to the rules applicable to hybrid prepaid-credit cards; however, it typically will be subject to Regulation Z depending on its own terms and conditions, independent of the connection to the prepaid account. Thus, a non-covered separate credit feature may be subject to the provisions in § 1026.55 in its own right.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to non-covered separate credit features that are subject to § 1026.55, new comment 55(a)-4 provides that final § 1026.55 does not apply to any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account that is not a charge imposed as part of the plan under new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(E). The Bureau notes that under new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(E) and new comment 6(b)(3)(iii)(E)-1, with respect to a non-covered separate credit feature as defined in new § 1026.61, none of the fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are “charges imposed as part of the plan” under final § 1026.6(b)(3) with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature. New comment 6(b)(3)(iii)(E)-1 also cross-references new comment 4(b)(11)-1.ii.B which provides that none of the fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are finance charges under final § 1026.4 with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature. Thus, final § 1026.55 does not apply to any fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analyses of §§ 1026.4 and 1026.6 above, the Bureau believes that fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account are more appropriately regulated under Regulation E, rather than regulated under Regulation Z, with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1026.52(a)(2) provides that the 25 percent restriction does not apply to late payment fees, over-the-limit fees, returned-payment fees, or fees that the consumer is not required to pay with respect to the account. Existing comment 52(a)(2)-1 provides guidance on the types of fees that are included in the 25 percent threshold. Specifically, existing comment 52(a)(2)-1 provides that except as provided in existing § 1026.52(a)(2), existing § 1026.52(a) applies to any fees or other charges that a card issuer will or may require the consumer to pay with respect to a credit card account during the first year after account opening, other than charges attributable to periodic interest rates. The existing comment further clarifies that for example, § 1026.52(a) applies to: (1) Fees that the consumer is required to pay for the issuance or availability of credit described in § 1026.60(b)(2), including any fee based on account activity or inactivity and any fee that a consumer is required to pay in order to receive a particular credit limit; (2) fees for insurance described in § 1026.4(b)(7) or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage described in § 1026.4(b)(10) written in connection with a credit transaction, if the insurance or debt cancellation or debt suspension coverage is required by the terms of the account; (3) fees that the consumer is required to pay in order to engage in transactions using the account (such as cash advance fees, balance transfer fees, foreign transaction fees, and fees for using the account for purchases); (4) fees that the consumer is required to pay for violating the terms of the account (except to the extent specifically excluded by existing § 1026.52(a)(2)(i)); (5) fixed finance charges; and (6) minimum charges imposed if a charge would otherwise have been determined by applying a periodic interest rate to a balance except for the fact that such charge is smaller than the minimum.</analysisParagraph>

The Bureau proposed to add new comment 52(a)(2)-2 that would have provided additional examples of the types of fees that would be covered by the 25 percent limitation for credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan that are accessed by prepaid cards that are credit cards. Specifically, proposed comment 52(a)(2)-2 would have provided that except as provided in existing § 1026.52(a)(2), existing § 1026.52(a) applies to any charge or fee, other than a charge attributable to a periodic interest rate, that the card issuer will or may require the consumer to pay in connection with a credit account accessed by a prepaid card that is a credit card, including fees that are assessed on the prepaid account in connection with credit accessed by the prepaid card. Under proposed comment 52(a)(2)-2, these fees would have included, but would not have been limited to: (1) Per transaction fees for “shortages” or “overdrafts;” (2) fees for transferring funds from a credit account to a prepaid account that are both accessed by the prepaid card; (3) a daily, weekly, or monthly (or other periodic) fee (other than a periodic interest rate) assessed each period a prepaid account is in “overdraft” status, or would be in overdraft status but for funds supplied by a linked line of credit accessed by the prepaid card; or (4) a daily, weekly, or monthly (or other periodic) fee (other than a periodic interest rate) assessed each period a line of credit accessed by the prepaid card has an outstanding balance.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>The Final Rule</title>

In addition, the section heading to § 1026.52(a) is revised to delete the reference to limitations prior to account opening to be consistent with the scope of the limitations set forth in § 1026.52(a); no substantive change is intended. As discussed in more detail below, the Bureau is adding new comments 52(a)(2)-2 and -3 to provide guidance on how § 1026.52(a) applies to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards and non-covered separate credit features as defined in § 1026.61 that are subject to § 1026.52(a).&lt;footnote ref="671"&gt;The proposal would have provided that the term “credit card” includes an account number that is not a prepaid card that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan that allows deposits directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. Proposed comment 52(a)(2)-3 would have provided an additional example of the types of fees that that would be covered by the 25 percent limitation for credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan that are accessed by such account numbers. For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(15)(i), the final rule does not adopt proposed comment 52(a)(2)-3 related to these account numbers.&lt;/footnote&gt;

        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards.&lt;/em&gt; The Bureau is revising proposed comment 52(a)(2)-2 from the proposal to be consistent with new § 1026.61. New comment 52(a)(2)-2 provides that with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61 where the credit feature is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, final § 1026.52(a) applies to the following fees: (1) Except as provided in § 1026.52(a)(2), any fee or charge imposed on the covered separate credit feature, other than a charge attributable to a periodic interest rate, during the first year after account opening that the card issuer will or may require the consumer to pay in connection with the credit feature; and (2) except as provided in existing § 1026.52(a)(2), any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account (other than a charge attributable to a periodic interest rate) during the first year after account opening that the card issuer will or may require the consumer to pay where that fee or charge is a charge imposed as part of the plan under final § 1026.6(b)(3). As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 and a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.6 above, with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, a fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account is a “charge imposed as part of the plan” under final § 1026.6(b)(3) to the extent that the amount of the fee or charge exceeds comparable fees or charges imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. This fee or charge also is a finance charge under new § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that the restriction on fees set forth in TILA section 127(n)(1), as implemented in existing § 1026.52(a), provides important protections for consumers, particularly in the context of covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards. As discussed above, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii) includes an overdraft credit feature offered by prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner in connection with a prepaid account. In this case, the covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card is designed to provide liquidity to the prepaid account. As discussed above, except as provided in existing § 1026.52(a)(2), with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61, the restriction in final § 1026.52(a) applies to fees or charges imposed on the covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, as well as fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account when those fees are “charges imposed as part of the plan” under final § 1026.6(b)(3).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Although the Bureau believes that issuers will generally assess credit-related fees on the covered separate credit feature, TILA section 127(n)(1) applies to “any fees,” with some exceptions, that the consumer is required to pay under the terms of a credit card account under an open-end consumer credit plan. That term readily encompasses credit-related fees that are imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account because it speaks to what the fees relate to, not where they are placed. Even if the term were ambiguous, the Bureau believes—based on its expertise and experience with respect to credit card markets—that interpreting it to encompass credit-related fees imposed on the asset feature would promote the purposes of TILA to protect the consumer against inaccurate and unfair credit billing and credit card practices. The Bureau believes that from the consumer's perspective, there is no practical difference between a fee charged against the covered separate credit feature and a credit-related fee charged to the asset feature of the prepaid account in order to access credit because both functionally reduce the total amount of credit available to the consumer through the covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card until such fees are paid. If TILA section 127(n)(1) were not interpreted to include credit-related fees charged across any linked accounts, the Bureau is concerned that card issuers could hide non-exempt fees by imposing them on the asset feature of the prepaid account or by creating separate artificially distinct credit accounts and attempting to collect the non-exempt fees from those linked credit accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also is adding new comment 52(a)(2)-3 to provide that final § 1026.52(a) does not apply to any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account that is not a charge imposed as part of the plan under new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D) with respect to the covered separate credit feature. The Bureau notes that under new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D) and new comment 6(b)(3)(iii)(D)-1, with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61, a fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account is not a “charge imposed as part of the plan” with respect to the covered separate credit feature to the extent that the amount of the fee or charge does not exceed comparable fees or charges imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have a credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. As described in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii), these fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are not finance charges under new § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii). As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analyses of §§ 1026.4 and 1026.6 above, the Bureau believes that fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account that are not finance charges (and thus, not charges imposed as part of the plan under new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D)) with respect to the covered separate credit feature are more appropriately regulated under Regulation E, rather than regulated under Regulation Z, with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, one consumer group commenter indicated that the Bureau should clarify that “load” fees are included for purposes of the 25 percent restriction, even if they are charged to the prepaid account. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) above, new comment 4(b)(11)(ii)-1 sets forth the circumstances in which load or transfer fees imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are finance charges under new § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii). To the extent that a load fee or transfer fee that is imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account is a finance charge under new § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii), that load or transfer fee is subject to the 25 percent restriction under § 1026.52(a) because those fees would be “charges imposed as part of the plan” under final § 1026.6(b)(3).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Non-covered separate credit features.&lt;/em&gt; As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a “non-covered separate credit feature,” which means that the separate credit feature either (1) cannot be accessed in the course of a prepaid card transaction to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; or (2) is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. As described in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii), a non-covered separate credit feature is not subject to the rules applicable to hybrid prepaid-credit cards; however, it typically will be subject to Regulation Z depending on its own terms and conditions, independent of the connection to the prepaid account. Thus, a non-covered separate credit feature may be subject to the provisions in § 1026.52(a) in its own right.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to such non-covered separate credit features that are subject to § 1026.52(a), new comment 52(a)(2)-3 also provides that final § 1026.52(a) does not apply to any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account that is not a charge imposed as part of the plan under new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(E) with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature. Under new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(E) and new comment 6(b)(3)(iii)(E)-1, with respect to a non-covered separate credit feature that is accessible by a prepaid card as defined in new § 1026.61, none of the fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are “charges imposed as part of the plan” under final § 1026.6(b)(3) with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature. New comment 6(b)(3)(iii)(E)-1 also cross-references new comment 4(b)(11)-1.ii.B, which provides that none of the fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are finance charges under final § 1026.4 with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature. Thus, final § 1026.52(a) does not apply to any fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analyses of §§ 1026.4 and 1026.6 above, the Bureau believes that fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account are more appropriately regulated under Regulation E, rather than regulated under Regulation Z, with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>New § 1026.61(a)(5) sets forth definitions of the following terms that are used in new § 1026.61 and throughout the regulation in relation to hybrid prepaid-credit cards: (1) Prepaid account; (2) prepaid card; (3) prepaid account issuer &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;;&lt;/em&gt; (4) affiliate; (5) business partner; (6) asset feature; (7) credit feature; and (8) separate credit feature. Each of these definitions is discussed in more detail below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Prepaid Account and Prepaid Card</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Although Regulation Z and its commentary use the term “debit card,” that term is not defined. Generally, under the existing regulation, this term refers to a card that accesses an asset account. Specifically, existing comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.B provides as an example of a credit card: “A card that accesses both a credit and an asset account (that is, a debit-credit card).” In addition, existing comment 2(a)(15)-2.ii.A provides that the term credit card does not include a debit card with no credit feature or agreement, even if the creditor occasionally honors an inadvertent overdraft.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Under the proposal, different rules generally would have applied in Regulation Z depending on whether credit is accessed by a card or device that accesses a prepaid account or a card or device that accesses another type of asset account. To assist compliance with the regulation, the proposal would have defined “debit card” for purposes of Regulation Z in proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(iv) to mean “any card, plate, or other single device that may be used from time to time to access an asset account other than a prepaid account.” The proposed definition of “debit card” would have specified that it does not include a prepaid card. Proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(v) would have defined “prepaid card” to mean “any card, code, or other device that can be used to access a prepaid account.” The proposal would have defined “prepaid account” in proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(vi) to mean a prepaid account as defined in proposed Regulation E § 1005.2(b)(3). Proposed comment 2(a)(15)-6 would have provided that the term “prepaid card” in proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(v) includes any card, code, or other device that can be used to access a prepaid account, including a prepaid account number or other code. That proposed comment also would have provided that the phrase “credit accessed by a prepaid card” means any credit that is accessed by any card, code, or other device that also can be used to access a prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The term “prepaid account” as defined in proposed Regulation E § 1005.2(b)(3) would not have included gift cards, government benefit accounts that are excluded under Regulation E § 1005.15(a)(2), employee flex cards, and HSA and other medical expense cards. Under current Regulation Z and the proposal, these cards would not been credit cards unless they were subject to an agreement to extend credit.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Nonetheless, the Bureau solicited comment on whether gift cards, government benefit accounts that are excluded under Regulation E § 1005.15(a)(2), employee flex cards, and HSA and other medical expense cards should be included within the definition of “prepaid accounts” for purposes of Regulation Z, even if those accounts would not been considered prepaid accounts for purposes of error resolution, disclosure, and other purposes under Regulation E. The Bureau solicited comment on current and potential credit features that may be offered on these types of cards, the nature of potential risks to consumers if credit features were offered on these types of cards, and incentives for the industry to offer credit features on these types of cards. The Bureau also solicited comment on any implications of treating these products as prepaid accounts under Regulation Z but not Regulation E.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several industry commenters, including programs managers and a payment network, indicated that these products should not be covered by Regulation Z if they are not prepaid accounts under Regulation E. One consumer group commenter indicated that these accounts should be covered by Regulation Z if they offer overdraft credit even if they are not prepaid accounts under Regulation E. This commenter indicated that while those types of accounts would rarely, if ever, have a credit or overdraft feature, the Bureau should to include prepaid cards in the Regulation Z definition of credit card if they access credit or overdraft features in connection with such accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One program manager also indicated that the Bureau should exempt student cards and payroll cards from the overdraft provisions in the proposal under Regulation Z even if these cards access prepaid accounts as defined in Regulation E.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z&lt;/em&gt; section, consistent with the proposal, the final rule generally applies different rules in Regulation Z depending on whether credit is accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card that can access both a covered separate credit feature and the asset feature of a prepaid account as defined in new § 1026.61(a), or credit is accessed by a card or device that accesses another type of asset account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consistent with the proposal, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(15)(iv) above, the term “debit card” is defined in new § 1026.2(a)(15)(iv) to mean any card, plate, or other single device that may be used from time to time to access an asset account other than a prepaid account, as defined in new § 1026.61. Under the final rule, the term “debit card” does not include a prepaid card, as defined in § 1026.61.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The final rule moves the definition of “prepaid card” from proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(v) to new § 1026.61(a)(5)(vii) and adopts this definition as proposed. New § 1026.61(a)(5)(vii) defines “prepaid card” to mean any card, code, or other device that can be used to access a prepaid account. The final rule moves proposed comment 2(a)(15)-6 to new comment 61(a)(5)(vii)-1 and revises it. Consistent with proposed comment 2(a)(15)-6, new comment 61(a)(5)(vii)-1 clarifies that the term “prepaid card” in new § 1026.61(a)(5)(vii) includes any card, code, or other device that can be used to access a prepaid account, including a prepaid account number or other code. Proposed comment2(a)(15)-6 also would have provided that the phrase “credit accessed by a prepaid card” means any credit that is accessed by any card, code, or other device that also can be used to access a prepaid account. The Bureau has not adopted this part of proposed comment 2(a)(15)-6 because the final rule does not use the term “credit accessed by a prepaid card.” Instead, the final rule uses the term “hybrid prepaid-credit card” as defined in § 1026.61(a).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is not exempting categorically student cards and payroll cards from the provisions in the final rule under Regulation Z even if these cards access prepaid accounts as defined in Regulation E and meet the definition of “hybrid prepaid-credit card” under new § 1026.61(a). These cards would be “prepaid cards” under new § 1026.61(a)(15)(vii) to the extent that they are cards, codes, or other devices that can be used to access a prepaid account, including a prepaid account number or other code. In addition, these cards would be hybrid prepaid-credit cards to the extent they meet the definition in new § 1026.61(a). The Bureau does not believe that it is appropriate to categorically exclude these cards from the provisions in the final rule under Regulation Z to the extent these cards are “hybrid prepaid-credit cards” as defined in new § 1026.61(a). The Bureau believes that consumers holding student prepaid cards and payroll cards would benefit from the protections provided by Regulation Z if those prepaid cards meet the definition of “hybrid prepaid-credit cards” under new § 1026.61(a). In addition, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to maintain consistency between the definitions of “prepaid account” in Regulation E § 1005.2(b)(3) and Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(5)(v).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The final rule moves the definition of “prepaid account” from proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(vi) to new § 1026.61(a)(5)(v) and adopts this definition as proposed. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of Regulation E § 1005.2(b)(3)(ii) above, the term “prepaid account,” as defined in final Regulation E § 1005.2(b)(3)(ii), does not include, among other things, products such as gift cards, accounts established for distributing certain needs-tested government benefits that are excluded under Regulation E § 1005.15(a)(2), and certain types of health care and employee benefit accounts. The provisions in the final rule that apply to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards do not apply to cards or access devices that access these types of accounts because they are not “prepaid accounts” under final Regulation E § 1005.2(b)(3) or new Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(5)(v). At this time, the Bureau does not believe that it is appropriate to include these accounts in the definition of “prepaid account” for purposes of new § 1026.61(a)(5)(v), when these accounts are not “prepaid accounts” for purposes of final § 1005.2(b)(3). The Bureau is unaware of any credit features currently associated with cards that access these types of accounts. At this time, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to maintain consistency between the definitions of “prepaid account” in Regulation E § 1005.2(b)(3) and Regulation Z § 1026.61(a)(5)(v).</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Prepaid Account Issuer, Affiliate, and Business Partner</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The proposal did not define the terms “prepaid account issuer,” “affiliate,” or “business partner.” For the reasons discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61, the Bureau is revising the circumstances from the proposal for when a prepaid card is a credit card (&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;i.e.,&lt;/em&gt; hybrid prepaid-credit card) under Regulation Z. Under the final rule, new § 1026.62(a)(2)(i) provides that a prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a separate credit feature when it is a single device that can be used from time to time to access the separate credit feature where the following two conditions are satisfied: (1) The card can draw, transfer, or authorize the draw or transfer of credit from the separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; and (2) the separate credit feature is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Definition of “prepaid account issuer.”&lt;/em&gt; New § 1026.61(a)(5)(vi) defines “prepaid account issuer” to mean a financial institution as defined in Regulation E § 1005.2(i) with respect to a prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Definition of “affiliate.”&lt;/em&gt; New § 1026.61(a)(5)(i) defines “affiliate” to mean any company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another company, as set forth in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956.&lt;footnote ref="704"&gt;12 U.S.C. 1841 &amp;lt;em data-original="E-03"&amp;gt;et seq.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&lt;/footnote&gt;
             This definition is consistent with how affiliate is used in other provisions in Regulation Z.&lt;footnote ref="705"&gt;&amp;lt;em data-original="E-03"&amp;gt;See, e.g.,&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; existing § 1026.32(b)(5).&lt;/footnote&gt;
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Definition of “business partner.”&lt;/em&gt; New § 1026.61(a)(5)(iii) defines the term “business partner” for purposes of new § 1026.61 and other provisions in Regulation Z related to hybrid prepaid-credit cards to mean a person (other than the prepaid account issuer or its affiliates) that can extend credit through a separate credit feature where the person or its affiliate has “an arrangement” with a prepaid account issuer or its affiliate. As explained in new comment 61(a)(5)(iii)-1, a person that can extend credit or its affiliate has an arrangement with a prepaid account issuer or its affiliate for purposes of new § 1026.61(a)(5)(iii) if the circumstances in either comment 61(a)(5)(iii)-1.i or comment 61(a)(5)(iii)-1.ii are met. First, new comment 61(a)(5)(iii)-1.i provides that an unaffiliated person that can extend credit is a business partner of the prepaid account issuer if the person that can extend credit or its affiliate has an agreement with the prepaid account issuer or its affiliate that allows a prepaid card from time to time to draw, transfer, or authorize a draw or transfer of credit from the separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. New comment 61(a)(5)(iii)-1.i provides, however, that the parties are not considered to have such an agreement merely because the parties participate in a card network or payment network together.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Second, new comment 61(a)(5)(iii)-1.ii provides that an unaffiliated person that can extend credit is a business partner of the prepaid account issuer if the person or its affiliate has a business, marketing, promotional agreement, or other arrangement with the prepaid account issuer or its affiliate where the agreement or arrangement provides that prepaid accounts offered by the prepaid account issuer will be marketed to the customers of the person that can extend credit; or the credit feature will be marketed to the holders of prepaid accounts offered by the prepaid account issuer (including any marketing to customers to link the separate credit feature to the prepaid account to be used as an overdraft credit feature); and (2) at the time of the marketing agreement or arrangement, or at any time afterwards, the prepaid card from time to time can draw, transfer, or authorize the draw or transfer of credit from the separate credit feature in the course of transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers. In this case, this requirement is satisfied even if there is no specific agreement between the parties that the card can access the separate credit feature, as described above under new comment 61(a)(5)(iii)-1.i. For example, this requirement is satisfied even if the draw, transfer, or authorization of the draw or transfer, from the separate credit feature is effectuated through a card network or payment network.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 61(a)(5)(iii)-2 provides that a person (other than a prepaid account issuer or its affiliates) that can extend credit through a separate credit feature will be deemed to have an arrangement with the prepaid account issuer if the person that can extend credit, its service provider, or the person's affiliate has an arrangement with the prepaid account issuer, its service provider such as a program manager, or the issuer's affiliates. In that case, the person that can extend credit will be a business partner of the prepaid account issuer. For example, if the affiliate of the person that can extend credit has an arrangement with the prepaid account issuer's affiliate, the person that can extend credit will be the business partner of the prepaid account issuer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>To prevent evasion of the protections provided in the final rule related to hybrid prepaid-credit cards, the Bureau believes that it is important to include an unaffiliated third party that can extend credit through a separate credit feature as a “business partner” of the prepaid account issuer where the person that can extend credit, or its affiliate, has a marketing agreement or arrangement with the prepaid account issuer, or its affiliate, and where, whether or not by agreement, the prepaid card can access the separate credit feature in the course of a transaction. Otherwise, the Bureau is concerned that without including such arrangements, prepaid account issuers or their affiliates could structure an arrangement with an unaffiliated third party that can extend credit, or its affiliate, to avoid forming an “agreement,” as discussed in new comment 61(a)(5)(iii)-1.i, that the card may be used to access the third party's credit feature as an overdraft credit feature when all the parties understand that this type of connection is occurring. Such a result could frustrate the operation of certain consumer protections provided in the final rule. The Bureau believes that when there is a marketing agreement or arrangement between the parties as described in new comment 61(a)(5)(iii)-1.ii.A, the parties have a sufficient connection such that the unaffiliated third party that can extend credit should understand when its credit feature is used as an overdraft credit feature with respect to a prepaid account, even if there is no specific agreement between the parties to that effect under new comment 61(a)(5)(iii)-1.i. Also, the Bureau believes that these types of links between the prepaid account issuer and the unaffiliated third party that can extend credit are likely to involve revenue sharing or payments between the two companies, and the pricing structure of the two accounts may be tied together. Thus, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to consider these entities to be business partners in this context.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Asset Feature, Credit Feature, and Separate Credit Feature</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(b) below, the final rule requires that credit features that are accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card be structured as a separate credit feature—either a separate sub-account or account—rather than as a negative balance on the asset feature of a prepaid account. While a negative balance structure would be permissible where an issuer only offers incidental credit pursuant to new § 1026.61(a)(4),&lt;footnote ref="706"&gt;If a prepaid account issuer complies with the exception in § 1026.61(a)(4) with respect to a prepaid account that is accessed by a prepaid card, the prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under Regulation Z, and thus is not a credit card under Regulation Z. The prepaid account issuer is not a card issuer under § 1026.2(a)(7) and thus § 1026.61(b) does not apply to the overdraft credit feature accessed by the prepaid card.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             an issuer that offers more extensive credit or charges credit-related fees using a negative balance structure would be subject to the credit card rules pursuant to new § 1026.61(a)(3), and would be in violation of the rule on account structure specified in new § 1026.61(b). Instead, under the final rule, a card issuer must structure the credit feature as a separate credit feature, either as a separate credit account or as a credit subaccount of a prepaid account that is separate from the asset feature of the prepaid account. The separate credit feature is a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau defines the terms “asset feature,” “credit feature,” and “separate credit feature” to effectuate the provisions set forth in new § 1026.61(b), as well as other provisions set forth in new § 1026.61 and in Regulation Z generally that relate to hybrid prepaid-credit cards. These defined terms are discussed in more detail below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Definition of “asset feature.”&lt;/em&gt; Under the final rule, the term “asset feature” in new § 1026.61(a)(5)(vii) is defined to mean an asset account that is a prepaid account, or an asset subaccount of a prepaid account. As described above and in more detail below in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(b), a card issuer cannot structure a credit feature as a negative balance on the asset feature of a prepaid account, unless the conditions in new § 1026.61(a)(4) are met.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Definition of “credit feature.”&lt;/em&gt; The term “credit feature” is defined in new § 1026.61(a)(5)(iv) to mean either: (1) A separate credit account or a credit subaccount of a prepaid account through which credit can be extended in connection with a prepaid card, or (2) a negative balance on an asset feature of a prepaid account through which credit can be extended in connection with a prepaid card. As discussed above, under new § 1026.61(b), a card issuer may not structure a credit feature as a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account, except as permitted under new § 1026.61(a)(4).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 61(a)(5)(iv)-1 provides that the definition of “credit feature” set forth in new § 1026.61(a)(5)(iv) only defines that term for purposes of Regulation Z in relation to credit offered in connection with a prepaid account or prepaid card. This comment explains that this definition does not impact when an account, subaccount or negative balance is a credit feature under Regulation Z with respect to credit in relation to a checking account or other transaction account that is not a prepaid account, or a debit card. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g.,&lt;/em&gt; existing comment 2(a)(15)-2.ii.A and existing comment 4(b)(2)-1 where the term credit feature is used in relation to a debit card or asset account other than a prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One issuing credit union indicated that the Bureau should clarify that where a prepaid account is loaded with funds using a deposit account where an overdraft protection program or overdraft line of credit is activated, the prepaid card does not become a credit card under the proposal because the overdraft protection program or overdraft line of credit was activated. New comment 61(a)(5)(iv)-2 provides that a “credit feature” for purposes of § 1026.61(a)(5)(iv) does not include an asset account other than a prepaid account that has an attached overdraft feature. For example, assume that funds are loaded or transferred to a prepaid account from an asset account (other than a prepaid account) on which an overdraft feature is attached. The asset account is not a credit feature under new § 1026.61(a)(5)(iv) even if the load or transfer of funds to the prepaid account triggers the overdraft feature that is attached to the asset account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Definition of “separate credit feature.”&lt;/em&gt; New § 1026.61(a)(5)(viii) defines “separate credit feature” to mean a credit account or a credit subaccount of a prepaid account through which credit can be extended in connection with a prepaid card that is separate from the asset feature of the prepaid account. This term does not include a negative balance on an asset feature of a prepaid account. As discussed above, under new § 1026.61(b), a card issuer must structure an overdraft credit feature in connection with a prepaid account as a separate credit feature, such as a credit account or credit subaccount to the prepaid account that is separate from the asset feature of the prepaid account, except for overdraft credit features described in new § 1026.61(a)(4). This separate credit feature is a “covered separate credit feature” under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i).</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, many industry commenters raised concerns regarding the breadth of fees that would be considered finance charges under the proposal. Many industry commenters were concerned that even though they were not intending to offer credit in connection with the prepaid account, credit could result in certain circumstances, such as forced pay-transactions as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a) above. Because this credit could be extended, many commenters were concerned that fees that generally applied to the prepaid account, but were not specific to the overdraft credit, could be finance charges under the proposal and thus would subject the prepaid account issuer to the credit card rules under Regulation Z. These commenters were concerned that they could not charge certain fees on the prepaid account, or would have to waive certain fees, for the prepaid card not to be a credit card under the proposal.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For example, one payment network indicated that a prepaid card should not be a credit card when it accesses credit extended through a negative balance on the asset balance of the prepaid account if the &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; fees charged on the prepaid account in connection with the extension of credit are the &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;very same&lt;/em&gt; fees that would apply to the same transaction on the prepaid card without an extension of credit. Similarly, two industry trade associations urged that a prepaid card should be a credit card when it accesses credit extended through a negative balance on the asset balance of the prepaid account only if the prepaid account issuer charges fees directly correlated with the overdraft in question. These commenters argued that a prepaid card should not be a credit card when it accesses credit extended through a negative balance on the asset balance of the prepaid account if the prepaid account issuer only imposes on the prepaid account fees or charges that are wholly unrelated to an overdraft, such as a fee to make a balance inquiry at an ATM. These commenters also indicated that a prepaid card should not be a credit card when the prepaid account issuer only imposes unrelated fees or charges on the prepaid account, even when these unrelated fees or charges are imposed when the prepaid account balance is negative.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Another industry trade association indicated that a monthly fee to hold the prepaid account should not cause a prepaid card to be a credit card simply because the fee may be imposed when the balance on the prepaid account is negative or because negative balances can occur on the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>A program manager indicated that the Bureau should clarify that a prepaid card is not a credit card simply because the prepaid account issuer charges reasonable debt collection costs (including attorney's fees) related to collecting the overdraft credit from a consumer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, many industry commenters were particularly concerned that under the proposal, a prepaid account issuer would need to waive per transaction fees in certain circumstances to avoid triggering the credit card rules. The circumstances raised by industry commenters centered on (1) force pay transactions; (2) payment cushions; and (3) transactions that take the account negative when a load of funds from an asset account is pending, as discussed in more detail below and in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a).
          </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>One consumer group commenter urged the Bureau to cover all prepaid cards as credit cards when the prepaid card accesses credit, regardless of whether a finance charge, as defined in § 1026.4, or a fee described under § 1026.4(c) is imposed for the credit. This commenter recognized, however, that exceptions for force pay transactions and payment cushions may be necessary. With respect to payment cushions, this commenter supported not triggering the credit card rules where a prepaid card can only access a de minimis amount of credit, using $10 as a safe harbor, if such credit is not promoted or disclosed. With respect to force pay transactions, this commenter supported requiring a prepaid account issuer to waive the per transaction fee that is imposed on a credit transaction where credit is extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account in order to avoid triggering the credit card rules under the proposal. Nonetheless, this commenter indicated that if the Bureau decides to make any exceptions with respect to force pay transactions, these exceptions should be limited to prepaid account issuers who do everything possible to prevent overdrafts, have overdrafts in only very rare and unpreventable situations, and do not charge penalty fees related to declined transactions, overdrafts, or negative balances.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, new § 1026.61(a)(4) creates an exception to the general rule that credit structured as a negative balance feature on an prepaid asset account is subject to the credit card rules, in order to provide flexibility for the kinds of incidental credit that commenters raised concerns about. Specifically as described in new § 1026.61(a)(4), an overdraft credit feature where credit is extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account is not accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card where: (1) The prepaid card cannot access a covered separate credit feature as defined in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i); (2) with respect to the prepaid account accessible by the prepaid card, the prepaid account issuer generally has a policy and practice of declining to authorize transactions made with the card when there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the amount of the transactions, or the prepaid account issuer only authorizes those transactions in circumstances related to payment cushions and delayed load cushions discussed below; and (3) with respect to the prepaid account accessible by the prepaid card, the prepaid account issuer does not charge credit-related fees for any credit extended on the asset feature of the prepaid account, except for fees or charges for the actual costs of collecting the credit extended if otherwise permitted by law.&lt;footnote ref="702"&gt;An industry trade association and an issuing bank were concerned that all prepaid cards (and associated account numbers) could be credit cards or otherwise subject to Regulation Z solely due to the fact that the cardholder can incur an overdraft that he or she is contractually obligated to repay. These commenters asked the Bureau to clarify that “credit” under Regulation Z would not include the amount of an overdraft if the consumer is not contractually obligated to reimburse the card issuer for that overdraft (&amp;lt;em data-original="E-03"&amp;gt;i.e.,&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; the consumer would not be incurring debt or deferring the payment of debt) and to clarify disclosure obligations if the consumer is not contractually obligated to repay the overdraft credit. The Bureau believes that it has addressed these concerns by providing the exception in § 1026.61(a)(4) for how prepaid account issuers may provide incidental credit as a negative balance on the prepaid account without being subject to Regulation Z, even if the consumer is contractually obligated to pay these overdrafts.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             Each of the three prongs of the limited exception is discussed in more detail below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that the exception in new § 1026.61(a)(4) addresses many of the concerns raised by industry commenters and consumer group commenters. To address evasion risks and other concerns raised by consumer group commenters discussed above, the Bureau has carefully calibrated new § 1026.61(a)(4). Specifically, under the final rule, a prepaid card is not a credit card under the regulation when it accesses credit through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account only in circumstances where, with respect to a prepaid account accessible by the prepaid card: (1) The prepaid account issuer generally declines to authorize transactions on the prepaid account that will create negative balances on the asset feature of the prepaid account (or allows those authorizations in limited circumstances related to payment cushions and delayed load cushions); and (2) the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit extended on the asset feature of the prepaid account. Thus, for example, a prepaid card is a credit card under Regulation Z (&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;i.e.,&lt;/em&gt; a hybrid prepaid-credit card) when credit is extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of a prepaid account where, with respect to the prepaid account accessible by the prepaid card: (1) The prepaid account issuer has a policy and practice of authorizing transactions (outside of the payment cushion and delayed load circumstances described above) where there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the prepaid account to cover the amount of the transaction at authorization; or (2) a prepaid account issuer charges credit-related fees for credit extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account beyond fees or charges for the actual costs of collecting the credit extended if otherwise permitted by law.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Thus, where new § 1026.61(a)(4) has not been satisfied, the final rule prohibits a prepaid account issuer from offering an overdraft credit feature as a negative balance to the asset feature of the prepaid account and requires the prepaid account issuer to offer the overdraft credit feature as a “covered separate credit feature” under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i). Specifically, under new § 1026.61(a)(3), a prepaid card that can access credit extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card for purposes of coverage under the credit card rules unless the card can only access credit described in new § 1026.61(a)(4). A person offering such an overdraft credit feature is a “card issuer” under final § 1026.2(a)(7) and is subject to Regulation Z, including new § 1026.61(b). However, to facilitate transparency and compliance with Regulation Z, the Bureau is prohibiting card issuers under new § 1026.61(b) from structuring an overdraft credit feature as a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account, except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4). Instead, under new § 1026.61(b), a card issuer must structure an overdraft credit feature in connection with a prepaid account as a separate credit feature, such as a credit account or credit subaccount to the prepaid account that is separate from the asset feature of the prepaid account, except for overdraft credit features described in new § 1026.61(a)(4). This separate credit feature is a “covered separate credit feature” under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that new § 1026.61(a)(4) will allow prepaid account issuers who do not intend to offer substantive credit programs to provide incidental credit in circumstances that will benefit consumers, without opening the door to widespread evasion of the rule. First, with respect to force pay transactions, payment cushions, and delayed load cushions, under this exception, the final rule provides that credit card rules will not be triggered so long as the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit extended and has met the other requirements. Second, the final rule provides that a prepaid account issuer is not required under this exception to waive per transaction fees imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account if the amount of the per transaction fee imposed for transactions involving credit is not higher than the amount of the fee that is imposed for transactions that only access funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account. Rather, the final rule provides that under this exception, if a fee is not a credit-related fee as enumerated in new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B), the prepaid account issuer may still debit these fees or charges from the asset feature when there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature to cover those fees or charges at the time they are imposed. Third, the final rule provides that under this exception, a prepaid account issuer may charge a fee to hold the prepaid account, so long as the amount of the fee or charge to hold the prepaid account imposed on the asset feature is not higher based on whether credit might be offered or has been accepted, whether or how much credit the consumer has accessed, or the amount of credit available. Fourth, the final rule provides that a prepaid account issuer may still qualify for the exception in new § 1026.61(a)(4) even if it charges fees or charges for the actual costs of collecting the credit extended if otherwise permitted by law, so long as the other conditions of the exception have been met.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>To the extent that a prepaid account issuer meets the conditions as described in new § 1026.61(a)(4) with respect to a prepaid card, the prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card and thus is not a credit card under the regulation. As discussed in more detail below, the final rule provides that in the case where a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card because the only credit it can access meets the conditions set forth in new § 1026.61(a)(4), the prepaid account issuer is not a card issuer under final § 1026.2(a)(7) with respect to the prepaid card. The prepaid account issuer also is not a creditor under final § 1026.17(a)(iii) or (iv) because it is not a card issuer under final § 1026.2(a)(7) with respect to the prepaid card. The prepaid account issuer also is not a creditor under final § 1026.2(a)(17)(i) as a result of imposing fees on the prepaid account because those fees are not finance charges as described in new comment 4(b)(11)-1.iii. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a), in light of the very limited nature of the incidental credit, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to exclude this incidental credit from coverage under Regulation Z.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Prepaid card cannot access a covered separate credit feature under § 1026.61(a)(2)(i).&lt;/em&gt; To qualify for the exception in new § 1026.61(a)(4), new § 1026.61(a)(4)(i) provides that the prepaid card cannot access credit from a covered separate credit feature, as defined in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i). The Bureau believes that allowing a prepaid account issuer to take advantage of the exception in new § 1026.61(a)(4) even though the card can access a covered separate credit feature, described in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i), would allow the prepaid account issuer to circumvent the rules in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 61(a)(4)-1.i and ii explain that § 1026.61(a)(4)(i) is designed to limit the exception for when a prepaid card is not a credit card to circumstances in which (1) the card can only access credit extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account in accordance with both the conditions set forth in new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(A) and (B); and (2) the card can access credit from a non-covered separate credit feature, as defined in new § 1026.62(a)(2)(ii), but cannot access credit for a covered separate credit feature, as defined in new § 1026.62(a)(2)(i).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 61(a)(4)-1.iii makes clear that a prepaid account issuer does not qualify for the exception in new § 1026.61(a)(4) if the prepaid account issuer structures the arrangement such that when there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account at the time a transaction is initiated, the card can draw, transfer, or authorize the draw or transfer of credit from a covered separate credit feature offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner during the authorization phase to complete the transaction so that credit is not extended on the asset feature of the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 61(a)(4)-1.iv provides guidance on how the regulation applies in cases where the prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card. Specifically, new comment 61(a)(4)-1.iv provides that in the case where a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card because the only credit it can access meets the conditions set forth in new § 1026.61(a)(4), the prepaid account issuer is not a card issuer under final § 1026.2(a)(7) with respect to the prepaid card. The prepaid account issuer also is not a creditor under final § 1026.17(a)(iii) or (iv) because it is not a card issuer under final § 1026.2(a)(7) with respect to the prepaid card. The prepaid account issuer also is not a creditor under final § 1026.2(a)(17)(i) as a result of imposing fees on the prepaid account because those fees are not finance charges, as described in new comment 4(b)(11)-1.iii.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;General policy and practice of declining transactions that will create a negative balance.&lt;/em&gt; To qualify for the exception in new § 1026.61(a)(4), new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(A) provides that with respect to any prepaid account that is accessible by the prepaid card, a prepaid account issuer also must have established a policy and practice of either declining to authorize any transaction for which it reasonably believes the consumer has insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account at the time the transaction is authorized, or declining to authorize any such transactions except in two circumstances related to payment cushions and delayed load cushions as discussed below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>This prong is designed to limit the exception under new § 1026.61(a)(4) to situations where the prepaid account issuer generally is not authorizing transactions that will take the asset feature of the prepaid account negative. The Bureau believes that this prong will help ensure that consumers do not develop a substantial negative balance on their prepaid asset accounts that most do not intend to use as a credit account, which could pose risks to consumers by compromising their ability to manage and control their finances. This prong is intended to address concerns raised by industry commenters that the proposed circumstances in which a prepaid card would be a credit card captured (1) “force pay” transactions, (2) payment cushions; and (3) delayed load cushions, while also balancing consumer group concerns that any such limited exceptions be cabined in a way that does not undermine the broader rule. Thus, the final rule does not cover overdraft credit features under Regulation Z where these three types of credit are extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account, so long as the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, “force pay” transactions occur where the prepaid account issuer is required by card network rules to pay a transaction even though there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the transaction at settlement. This can occur, for example, when a transaction is either not authorized in advance, or there were sufficient or available funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account at the time the transaction is authorized, but there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature at the time the transaction is settled, and a negative balance results on the asset feature when the transaction is paid.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 61(a)(4)(ii)(A)-1 makes clear that a prepaid account issuer is not required to receive an authorization request for each transaction to comply with this requirement. Nonetheless, the prepaid account issuer generally must establish an authorization policy as described above and have reasonable practices in place to comply with its established policy with respect to the authorization requests it receives. In that case, a prepaid account issuer is deemed to satisfy the requirement set forth in new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(A) even if a negative balance results on the prepaid account when a transaction is settled.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 61(a)(4)(ii)(A)-2 also makes clear that a prepaid account issuer may still satisfy the requirements set forth in § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(A) even if a negative balance results on the asset feature of the prepaid account because the prepaid account issuer debits the amount of any provisional credit that was previously granted on the prepaid account, as specified in final Regulation E § 1005.11, so long as the prepaid account issuer otherwise complies with the conditions set forth in new § 1026.61(a)(4). For example, under new § 1026.61(a)(4), a prepaid account issuer may not impose a fee or charge enumerated under new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B) with respect to such a negative balance.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>This exception also allows a prepaid account issuer to adopt a payment cushion where the issuer would authorize transactions that would take the account balance negative by no more than $10 at the time the transaction is authorized. The Bureau believes that this $10 payment cushion will benefit consumers without allowing consumers to develop a substantial negative balance on their prepaid asset accounts, which could pose risks for consumers.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, one consumer group commenter suggested that prepaid account issuer should be prevented from advertising or disclosing this payment cushion in order to take advantage of any exception of this credit from coverage under Regulation Z. The final rule does not prevent a prepaid account issuer from advertising or disclosing this payment cushion to consumers in order to take advantage of the exception in new § 1026.61(a)(4). The Bureau does not believe that it is necessary to restrict prepaid account issuers from advertising or disclosing this payment cushion to consumers, given the de minimis amount of credit ($10) that they may offer through the payment cushion. The Bureau believes that such a restriction may discourage prepaid account issuers from offering such a payment cushion, which could harm consumers.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In addition, the exception allows a prepaid account issuer to adopt a delayed load cushion. Specifically, in cases where the prepaid account issuer has received an instruction or confirmation for an incoming EFT originated from a separate asset account to load funds to the prepaid account or where the prepaid account issuer has received a request from the consumer to load funds to the prepaid account from a separate asset account but in either case the funds from the separate asset account have not yet settled, a prepaid account issuer may still qualify for the exception in new § 1026.61(a)(4) if the prepaid account authorizes transactions that take the prepaid account negative, so long as the transactions will not cause the account balance to become negative at the time of the authorization by more than the incoming or requested load amount, as applicable.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau recognizes that, in some cases, a prepaid account issuer may receive instructions or confirmation with respect to incoming EFTs from a separate asset account to load funds to the prepaid account, such as in cases involving direct deposits of salaries or government benefits. In such cases, prepaid account issuers may provide access to these funds to prepaid cardholders based on the instructions or confirmations even though the prepaid account issuer's transfer of funds has not yet settled, and therefore the prepaid account issuer does not have the funds.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau also recognizes that, in some cases, prepaid account issuers may receive a request from the consumer to load funds to the prepaid account from a separate asset account, including where the consumer, in the course of a transaction, requests a load from a deposit account or uses a debit card to cover the amount of the transaction. This can occur, for example, when a consumer authorizes a remittance through a mobile wallet which is linked to a checking account, the consumer requests that funds be taken from the consumer's checking account to pay for the remittance, and the remittance is sent before the incoming transfer of funds from the checking account is complete. In this case, the prepaid account issuer is extending credit through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account until the incoming transfer of funds from the checking account is complete.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In these two situations, the Bureau believes that it would benefit consumers to receive access to the funds prior to settlement, so long as the consumer generally is not charged credit-related fees. The Bureau does not believe these situations raise the same concerns as overdraft credit features offered by prepaid account issuers in connection with prepaid accounts.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>To facilitate compliance, new comment 61(a)(4)(ii)(A)-3.i provides examples of cases where the prepaid account issuer may receive an instruction or confirmation for an incoming EFT originating from a separate asset account to load funds to the prepaid account. This comment describes that such instructions or confirmations may occur in relation to a direct deposit of salary from an employer and a direct deposit of government benefits. New comment 61(a)(4)(ii)(A)-3.ii also provides an example of a case where the prepaid account issuer may receive a request from the consumer to load funds to the prepaid account from a separate asset account. This comment describes an example where the consumer, in the course of a transaction, requests a load from a deposit account or uses a debit card to cover the amount of the transaction if there are insufficient funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account to pay for the transaction.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 61(a)(4)(ii)(A)-4 also makes clear that the two circumstances described above in which a prepaid account issuer can authorize transactions that create a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account, namely payment cushions and delayed load cushions, are not mutually exclusive. For example, assume a prepaid account issuer has adopted the $10 payment cushion and the delayed load cushion. Also, assume the prepaid account issuer has received an instruction or confirmation for an incoming EFT originating from a separate asset account to load funds to the prepaid account, but the prepaid account issuer has not received the funds from the separate asset account. In this case, a prepaid account issuer satisfies this requirement if the amount of a transaction at authorization will not cause the prepaid account balance to become negative at the time of the authorization by more than the requested load amount plus the $10 payment cushion.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;No credit-related fees except for fees or charges for the actual costs of the collecting the credit if otherwise permitted by law.&lt;/em&gt; To qualify for the exception in new § 1026.61(a)(4), new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B) provides that with respect to prepaid accounts that are accessible by the prepaid card, the prepaid account issuer may generally not charge credit-related fees on the asset feature of the prepaid account. Specifically, the exception would only apply where the prepaid account issuer does not charge the following fees: (1) Any fees or charges for opening, issuing, or holding a negative balance on the asset feature, or for the availability of credit, whether imposed on a one-time or periodic basis. These fees do not include fees or charges to open, issue, or hold the prepaid account where the amount of the fee or charge imposed on the asset feature is not higher based on whether credit might be offered or has been accepted, whether or how much credit the consumer has accessed, or the amount of credit available; (2) any fees or charges that will be imposed only when credit is extended on the asset feature or when there is a negative balance on the asset feature, except that a prepaid account issuer may impose fees or charges for the actual costs of collecting the credit extended if otherwise permitted by law; or (3) any fees or charges where the amount of the fee or charge is higher when credit is extended on the asset feature or when there is a negative balance on the asset feature.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Thus, this prong prevents a prepaid account issuer from charging credit-related fees for the credit extended through a negative balance on the prepaid account, except for fees or charges for the actual costs of collecting the credit extended if otherwise permitted by law. Because the credit extended through the exception in new § 1026.61(a)(4) is intended to be limited to inadvertent or de minimis credit, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to limit the exception to instances in which the prepaid account issuer does not charge credit-related fees for the credit, except for fees or charges for the actual costs of collecting the credit extended if otherwise permitted by law. In addition, the Bureau believes that preventing prepaid account issuers from generally charging credit-related fees to take advantage of this exception will provide greater incentive to prepaid account issuers to limit the circumstances resulting in “forced pay” transactions extended through this exception. For the reasons discussed in the &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z&lt;/em&gt; section, the Bureau believes that it is appropriate to generally cover overdraft credit features offered by prepaid account issuers where, with respect to the prepaid account accessible by the prepaid card: (1) The prepaid account issuer has a policy and practice of authorizing transactions (outside of the payment cushion and delayed load circumstances described above) where there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the prepaid account to cover the amount of the transaction at authorization; or (2) a prepaid account issuer charges credit-related fees for credit extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account beyond fees or charges for the actual costs of collecting the credit extended if otherwise permitted by law.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>To facilitate compliance, new comment 61(a)(4)(ii)(B)-1 clarifies that new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B) does not prohibit a prepaid account issuer from charging different terms on different prepaid account programs. For example, the terms may differ between a prepaid account program where a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card is not offered in connection with any prepaid accounts within the prepaid account program and a prepaid account program where a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card may be offered to some consumers in connection with their prepaid accounts. The Bureau recognizes that prepaid account issuer may offer prepaid programs for different purposes and offer different services on those prepaid account programs. Those service differences may impact the pricing on the prepaid programs. The Bureau believes that requiring prepaid account issuers to charge the same fees on all of its prepaid account programs to take advantage of this exception would make the exception generally unavailable for most prepaid account issuers.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;) provides that to qualify for the exception in new § 1026.61(a)(4), a prepaid account issuer may not charge on the prepaid account any fees or charges for opening, issuing, or holding a negative balance on the asset feature, or for the availability of credit, whether imposed on a one-time or periodic basis. These fees do not include fees or charges to open, issue, or hold the prepaid account where the amount of the fee or charge imposed on the asset feature is not higher based on whether credit might be offered or has been accepted, whether or how much credit the consumer has accessed, or the amount of credit available. New comment 61(a)(4)(ii)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;)-1 clarifies the types of fees or charges that are included and not included under new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;). New comment 61(a)(4)(ii)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;)-1.i.A clarifies that the types of fees or charges described in new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;) include daily, weekly, monthly, or other periodic fees assessed each period that a prepaid account has a negative balance or is in “overdraft” status.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 61(a)(4)(ii)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;)-1.i.B also clarifies that the types of fees or charges described in new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;) include daily, weekly, monthly, or other periodic fees where the amount of the fee that applies each period is higher if the consumer is enrolled in a purchase cushion as described in new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(A)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;) or a delayed load cushion as described in new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(A)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;2&lt;/em&gt;) during that period. For example, assume that a consumer will pay a fee of $10 to hold the prepaid account if the consumer is not enrolled in a purchase cushion or a delayed load cushion during that month, or alternatively, the consumer will pay a fee of $15 to hold the prepaid account if the consumer is enrolled in a purchase cushion or delayed load cushion during that period. The $15 charge is a charge described in new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;) because the amount of the fee to hold the prepaid account is higher based on whether the consumer is participating in the payment cushion or delayed load cushion during that period.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 61(a)(4)(ii)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;)-1.ii clarifies that new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;) does not prohibit a daily, weekly, monthly, or other periodic fee to hold the prepaid account so long as the amount of the fee is not higher based on whether the consumer is enrolled in a purchase cushion or a delayed load cushion during that period, whether or how much credit has been extended during that period, or the amount of credit that is available during that period.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;2&lt;/em&gt;) provides that to qualify for the exception in new § 1026.61(a)(4), the prepaid account issuer may not impose any fees or charges on the asset feature of the prepaid account that will be imposed only when credit is extended on the asset feature or when there is a negative balance on the asset feature. New comment 61(a)(4)(ii)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;2&lt;/em&gt;)-1 provides examples of fees that are and are not fees or charges that will be imposed only when credit is extended on the asset feature or when there is a negative balance on the asset feature. New comment 61(a)(4)(ii)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;2&lt;/em&gt;)-1.i provides that fees or charges that will be imposed only when credit is extended on the asset feature or when there is a negative balance on the asset feature include: (1) A fee imposed because the balance on the prepaid account becomes negative; (2) interest charges attributable to a periodic rate that applies to the negative balance; (3) any fees for delinquency, default, or a similar occurrences that result from the prepaid account having a negative balance or being in “overdraft” status, except that the actual costs to collect the credit may be imposed if otherwise permitted by law; and (4) late payment fees.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Consistent with the proposal, a prepaid card is a credit card under the final rule if the prepaid account issuer charges a late fee with respect to the credit.&lt;footnote ref="703"&gt;Under the proposal, a prepaid card would have been a credit card if it is a single device that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan, except if that prepaid card only accesses credit that is not subject to any finance charge, as defined in § 1026.4 or any fee described in § 1026.4(c) and is not payable by written agreement in more than four installments. A late fee is a fee described in § 1026.4(c)(2) and thus under the proposal, a prepaid card would have been a credit card if a late fee was charged for the credit.&lt;/footnote&gt;

             With regard to late payment fees in particular, the Bureau is concerned that such fees could be structured to take the place of a per transaction fee for a credit extension on the prepaid account. For example, if a late fee were not included as a enumerated fee under new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B), a prepaid account issuer could provide that payment of the overdraft is due immediately and charge a late fee each day that the overdraft balance remains outstanding. The Bureau believes such a late fee would function as a fee for a negative balance that is not permitted to be imposed on the prepaid account if the prepaid account issuer intends to qualify for the exception in new § 1026.61(a)(4). Thus, the final rule provides that a late fee may not be imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account if the prepaid account issuer intends to qualify for the exception in new § 1026.61(a)(4). Nonetheless, new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;2&lt;/em&gt;) and new comment 61(a)(4)(ii)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;2&lt;/em&gt;)-1.ii.A provide that a prepaid account issuer may impose fees on the asset feature of the prepaid account for actual collection costs, including attorney's fees, and still qualify for the exception in new § 1026.61(a)(4) if those fees are otherwise permitted by law. The Bureau does not believe that allowing a prepaid account issuer to qualify for the exception in new § 1026.61(a)(4), even if the prepaid account issuer imposes actual collection costs to collect the credit, poses the same evasion risks discussed above in regard to late fees because these costs must be the actual costs incurred by the prepaid account issuer to collect the credit, and those fees must be otherwise permitted by law.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;3&lt;/em&gt;) provides that to qualify for the exception in new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B), the prepaid account issuer may not impose any fees or charges on the asset feature of the prepaid account that are higher when credit is extended on the asset feature or when there is a negative balance on the asset feature. New comment 61(a)(4)(ii)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;3&lt;/em&gt;)-1 provides examples of fees that are and are not fees or charges where the amount of the fee or charge is higher when credit is extended on the asset feature or when there is a negative balance on the asset feature.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 61(a)(4)(ii)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;3&lt;/em&gt;)-1.i.A provides that new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;3&lt;/em&gt;) includes transaction fees where the amount of the fee is higher based on whether the transaction accesses only asset funds in the asset feature or accesses credit. For example, a $15 transaction charge is imposed on the asset feature each time a transaction is authorized or paid when there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature at the time of the authorization or settlement. A $1.50 fee is imposed each time a transaction is paid entirely from funds in the asset feature. The $15 charge is a charge where the amount of the fee or charge is higher when credit is extended on the asset feature or when there is a negative balance on the asset feature because the transaction fee is higher when the transaction accesses credit than when the transaction accesses only asset funds in the asset feature.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 61(a)(4)(ii)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;3&lt;/em&gt;)-1.i.B provides that new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;3&lt;/em&gt;) includes a fee for a service on the prepaid account where the amount of the fee is higher based on whether the service is requested when the asset feature has a negative balance. For example, if a prepaid account issuer charges a higher fee for an ATM balance inquiry requested on the prepaid account if the balance inquiry is requested when there is a negative balance on the asset feature than the amount of fee imposed when there is a positive balance on the asset feature, the balance inquiry fee is a fee described in new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;3&lt;/em&gt;) because the amount of the fee is higher based on whether it is imposed when there is a negative balance on the asset feature.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Nonetheless, new comment 61(a)(4)(ii)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;3&lt;/em&gt;)-1.ii.A provides that new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;3&lt;/em&gt;) does not include transaction fees on the prepaid account where the amount of the fee imposed when the transaction accesses credit does not exceed the amount of the fee imposed when the transaction only accesses asset funds in the prepaid account. For example, assume a $1.50 transaction charge is imposed on the prepaid account for each paid transaction that is made with the prepaid card, including transactions that only access asset funds, transactions that take the account balance negative, and transactions that occur when the account balance is already negative. The $1.50 transaction charge imposed on the prepaid account is not prohibited under new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B) because the fee or charge is not higher when credit is extended on the asset feature or when there is a negative balance on the asset feature. Thus, under the final rule, a prepaid account issuer would not need to waive per transaction fees for credit extensions where the per transaction fee is not higher when credit is extended on the asset feature or when there is a negative balance on the asset feature.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 61(a)(4)(ii)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;3&lt;/em&gt;)-1.ii.B provides that new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;3&lt;/em&gt;) does not include a fee for a service on the prepaid account where the amount of the fee is not higher based on whether the service is requested when the asset feature has a negative balance. For example, if a prepaid account issuer charges the same amount of fee for an ATM balance inquiry regardless of whether there is a positive or negative balance on the asset feature, the balance inquiry fee is not a fee described in new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(C) also makes clear that a prepaid account issuer may still satisfy the exception in new § 1026.61(a)(4) even if it debits fees or charges from the asset feature when there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature to cover those fees or charges at the time they are imposed, so long as those fees or charges are not the type of fees or charges enumerated in new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B), as discussed above. New comment 61(a)(4)(ii)(C)-1 explains that a fee or charge not otherwise covered by new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii))(B) does not become covered by that provision simply because there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account to pay the fee when it is imposed. For example, assume that a prepaid account issuer imposes a fee for an ATM balance inquiry and the amount of the fee is not higher based on whether credit is extended or whether there is a negative balance on the prepaid account. Also assume that when the fee is imposed, there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account to pay the fee. The ATM balance inquiry fee does not become a fee covered by new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B) because the fee is debited from the prepaid account balance when there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the fee at the time it is imposed.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>61(a)(1) In General</title>
      <analysisParagraph>New § 1026.61(a)(1)(i) provides that credit offered in connection with a prepaid account is subject to new § 1026.61, as specified in that section. New § 1026.61(a)(1)(ii) provides generally that a prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a separate credit feature as described in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i), or with respect to a credit feature structured as a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account, as described in new § 1026.61(a)(3). New § 1026.61(a)(1)(ii) also provides that a hybrid prepaid-credit card is a credit card for purposes of Regulation Z with respect to those respective credit features. New § 1026.61(a)(1)(iii) specifies that a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card—and thus not a credit card for purposes of Regulation Z—if the only credit offered in connection with the prepaid account is incidental credit meeting the conditions set forth in new § 1026.61(a)(4).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As described below, the commentary to new § 1026.61(a)(1) contains general guidance on the circumstances in which a prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under § 1026.61(a).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Credit Accessible by a Hybrid Prepaid-Credit Card</title>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 61(a)(1)-1 makes clear that a prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card if the prepaid card can access credit from a covered separate credit feature described in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i), or if the prepaid card can access credit through a negative balance on the asset feature of a prepaid account described in new § 1026.61(a)(3) (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)), even if, for example: (1) The person that can extend the credit does not agree in writing to extend the credit; (2) the person retains discretion not to extend the credit; or (3) the person does not extend the credit once the consumer has exceeded a certain amount of credit. For the reasons discussed in the &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z&lt;/em&gt; section, the Bureau does not believe that whether a prepaid card is a credit card under Regulation Z should turn on whether the person has agreed in writing to extend the credit or retains the discretion not to extend credit in certain circumstances.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Prepaid Card That Is Solely an Account Number</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.F would have provided that the term “credit card” includes a prepaid card (including a prepaid card that is solely an account number) that is a single device that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan, except if that prepaid card only accesses credit that is not subject to any finance charge, as defined in § 1026.4, or any fee described in § 1026.4(c), and is not payable by written agreement in more than four installments. Thus, under the proposal, a prepaid card that is solely an account number would have been a credit card under § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) if it met this standard.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>For reasons discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analyses of § 1026.61(a)(2) and (4) below, the Bureau is revising from the proposal the circumstances in which a prepaid card is a credit card (&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;i.e.,&lt;/em&gt; hybrid prepaid-credit card). Nonetheless, consistent with the proposal, new comment 61(a)(1)-2 provides that a prepaid card that is solely an account number is a hybrid prepaid-credit card (and thus is a credit card under Regulation Z) if it meets the conditions for being a hybrid prepaid-credit card set forth in new § 1026.61(a).</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Usable From Time to Time</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Current comment 2(a)(15)-1 provides that a credit card under Regulation Z must be usable from time to time. Because this involves the possibility of repeated use of a single device, checks and similar instruments that can be used only once to obtain a single credit extension are not credit cards. The proposal would have revised this comment to provide that with respect to a preauthorized check that is issued on a prepaid account for which the funds are withdrawn at the time of preauthorization using the prepaid account number, the credit is obtained using the prepaid account number and not the check. The proposal also would have revised this comment to cross-reference proposed comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.F for a discussion of when a prepaid account number is a credit card.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive specific comment on this aspect of the proposal. The final rule moves the proposed guidance in proposed comment 2(a)(15)-1 related to prepaid accounts to new comment 61(a)(1)-3 and revises it to be consistent with new § 1026.61. Consistent with current comment 2(a)(15)-1, new comment 61(a)(1)-3 provides that in order for a prepaid card to be a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61(a), the prepaid card must be capable of being used from time to time to access credit as described in new § 1026.61(a). Because this involves the possibility of repeated use of a single device, checks and similar instruments that can be used only once to obtain a single credit extension are not hybrid prepaid-credit cards. Consistent with the proposal, new comment 61(a)(1)-3 also provides that with respect to a preauthorized check that is issued on a prepaid account for which credit is extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account, or credit is drawn, transferred or authorized to be drawn or transferred from a separate credit feature, the credit is obtained using the prepaid account number and not the check at the time of preauthorization using the prepaid account number. The comment states that a prepaid account number is a hybrid prepaid-credit card if the account number meets the conditions set forth in new § 1026.61(a), as discussed above.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Prepaid Account That Is a Digital Wallet</title>
        <analysisParagraph>One digital wallet provider indicated that the Bureau should clarify that the proposal's restrictions do not apply to a digital wallet's stored payment credentials. This commenter indicated that stored credentials do not present the same risks of consumer harm as overdraft protection for prepaid cards. New comment 61(a)(1)-4 provides guidance on the circumstances in which prepaid account number for a digital wallet that is a prepaid account is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61(a).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Specifically, new comment 61(a)(1)-4 states that a digital wallet that is capable of being loaded with funds is a prepaid account under final Regulation E § 1005.2(b)(3). &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; final Regulation E § 1005.2(b)(3) and comment 2(b)(3)(i)-6. The comment explains that a prepaid account number that can access such a digital wallet is a hybrid prepaid-credit card if it meets the conditions set forth in new § 1026.61(a).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comments 61(a)(1)-4.i.A and B provide illustrations of this rule. First, the comments explain that a prepaid account number that can access such a digital wallet is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i) where it can be used from time to time to: (1) Access a covered separate credit feature offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the prepaid account number to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers as described in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i); or (2) access the stored credentials for a covered separate credit feature offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the prepaid account number to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers as described in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Second, new comments 61(a)(1)-4.i.C and D state that a prepaid account number that can access such a digital wallet is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to: (1) Credentials stored in the prepaid account that access a non-covered separate credit feature as described in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii) that is not offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner, even if the prepaid account number can access those credentials in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the prepaid account number to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; or (2) credentials stored in the prepaid account that access a non-covered separate credit feature as described in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii), where the prepaid account number cannot access those credential in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the prepaid account number to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers, even if such credit feature is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Third, comment 61(a)(1)-4.ii states that a digital wallet is not a prepaid account under final Regulation E § 1005.2(b)(3) if the digital wallet can never be loaded with funds, such as a digital wallet that only stores payment credentials for other accounts. See final Regulation E § 1005.2(b)(3) and comment 2(b)(3)(i)-6. The comment explains that an account number that can access such a digital wallet would not be a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61(a), even if the wallet stores a credential for a separate credit feature that is offered by the digital wallet provider, its affiliate, or its business partner and can be used in the course of a transaction involving the digital wallet.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Prepaid Account That Can Be Used for Bill Payment Services</title>
        <analysisParagraph>To help ensure compliance with the final rule, the Bureau also is including guidance in the final rule on when a prepaid card that can be used for an online bill payment service offered by the prepaid account issuer is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under § 1026.61(a). New comment 61(a)(1)-5 provides that where a prepaid account can be used for online bill payment services offered by the prepaid account issuer, the prepaid card (including a prepaid account number) that can access that prepaid account is a hybrid prepaid-credit card if it meets the requirements set forth in § 1026.61(a). For example, if a prepaid account number can be used from time to time to initiate a transaction using the online bill payment service offered by the prepaid account issuer to pay a bill, and credit can be drawn, transferred, or authorized to be drawn or transferred to the prepaid account from a covered separate credit feature offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing that transaction as described in § 1026.61(a)(2)(i), the prepaid account number would be a hybrid prepaid-credit card under § 1026.61(a). In this case, the prepaid account number can be used to draw or transfer credit, or authorize the draw or transfer of credit, from a covered separate credit feature offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner in the course of completing a transaction to pay for goods or services through the online bill payment service.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Real-Time Notification or Opt-In for Overdrafts</title>
        <analysisParagraph>In the proposal, the Bureau discussed the possibility of requiring additional real-time notifications of transactions triggering an overdraft or requiring real-time opt-in by consumers to approve each overdraft in addition to applying the credit card rules in Regulation Z to overdraft credit features in connection with prepaid accounts. The Bureau understood that there may be technological, operational, and procedural challenges to the timing and delivery of such a notice or compliance with such an opt-in requirement, particularly in the point of sale retail environment. The Bureau was unsure at the time whether such a procedure could be implemented given that notifications and/or opt-in might require multiple communications among financial institutions, card networks, and merchants. Accordingly, the Bureau did not propose any requirements related to real-time notification or opt-in, but it solicited comment on possible options and suggestions for what it might require in this regard for prepaid accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several commenters, including industry trade associations and an issuing bank, indicated that real-time notification and opt-in is not feasible with current technology. Two of these commenters were concerned that such notices are not feasible given existing technology and that such notices could thus never be reliable and therefore would be more likely to lead to consumer confusion. These commenters stated that current processing systems will not necessarily have real-time balances and cannot be depended upon for providing real-time notices with any reliability. Further, these commenters stated that current terminals are not capable of displaying the required messaging. Thus, these commenters stated that it is not clear that the requisite technology is in place to comply with the potential notification and opt-in requirements discussed above, and thus there is a likelihood that such a requirement could lead to consumer confusion. Moreover, even if the card issuer clearly discloses that real-time notifications will not always be provided, the fact that they could be provided for the majority of transactions will lead consumers over time to believe that the notices are more reliable than in fact they are.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One program manager that offers an overdraft feature in connection with some of its prepaid accounts indicated that consumers who use the overdraft feature consent to receive notifications electronically, and the program manager sends electronic messages notifying consumers when they have overdrafted. The program manager indicated that most of these consumers with the overdraft feature also choose to receive alert messages that provide balance information periodically and after every transaction. This program manager indicated that a point-of-sale opt-in may present challenges, but it may be feasible to create a program where the overdraft feature could be turned on for a time-period during which the consumer intends to use the feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One consumer group said that the Bureau should mandate clear and deliberate opt-in processes so the consumer knows exactly the moment when they can begin incurring overdraft charges. Another consumer group commenter stated that current technology exists that can notify a person that the account has insufficient funds, via text or email. After receiving this notification, consumers could transfer funds if they wish to avoid credit. This commenter noted that its research has found that many people overdraft without knowing it and most would prefer to have transactions declined rather than paying a fee for overdrawing their accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Based on these comments, the Bureau is not adopting real-time notification and opt-in requirements at this time. The Bureau will continue to monitor developments with respect to real-time notification and opt-in.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>61(a)(3) Prepaid Card Can Access Credit Extended Through a Negative Balance On the Asset Feature of the Prepaid Account</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Many industry commenters argued that the Bureau should not regulate overdraft credit features under Regulation Z except where there is an agreement to extend credit, consistent with how overdraft credit is treated with respect to checking accounts. These commenters said that the Bureau should instead subject overdraft credit programs where there is not an agreement to the opt-in regime in Regulation E § 1005.17, which currently applies to overdraft services provided for ATM and one-time debit card transactions. For the reasons discussed in the &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z&lt;/em&gt; section, the Bureau continues to believe that it is appropriate generally to cover overdraft credit features offered by prepaid account issuers that are structured as a negative balance on the prepaid account as credit card accounts under Regulation Z, except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Accordingly, new § 1026.61(a)(3)(i) provides that a prepaid card that can access credit extended through a negative balance on the asset balance of the prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card unless the card can only access incidental credit as described in new § 1026.61(a)(4). Nonetheless, as discussed in more detail below, new § 1026.61(a)(3) is intended to trigger coverage under the credit card rules with respect to such overdraft credit features. For purposes of coverage, a person offering such an overdraft credit feature is a “card issuer” under final § 1026.2(a)(7) that is subject to Regulation Z, including new § 1026.61(b). However, as discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(b) below, new § 1026.61(b) prohibits card issuers from structuring an overdraft credit feature as a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account, unless the program is structured to involve only incidental credit as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4). The Bureau believes that this rule is necessary to promote transparency and compliance with the credit card requirements. Thus, under new § 1026.61(b), a card issuer must structure an overdraft credit feature in connection with a prepaid account as a separate credit feature, such as a credit account or credit subaccount to the prepaid account that is separate from the asset feature of the prepaid account, except for overdraft credit features described in new § 1026.61(a)(4). This separate credit feature is a “covered separate credit feature” under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i). Thus, new § 1026.61(a)(3)(ii) provides that notwithstanding that § 1026.61(c)(3)(i) triggers coverage under Regulation Z, structuring a hybrid prepaid-credit card to access credit through a negative balance on the asset feature violates new § 1026.61(b). A prepaid account issuer can use a negative asset balance structure to extend credit on an asset feature of a prepaid account only if the prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card as described in new § 1026.61(a)(4).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In terms of providing guidance on the situations that trigger coverage under § 1026.61(a)(3)(i), new comment 61(a)(3)(i)-1.i provides a cross-reference to new comment 2(a)(14)-3 for examples of when transactions authorized or paid on the asset feature of a prepaid account meet the definition of credit under final § 1026.2(a)(14). New comment 61(a)(3)(i)-1.ii provides that except as provided in § 1026.61(a)(4), a prepaid card would trigger coverage as a hybrid prepaid-credit card if it is a single device that can be used from time to time to access credit that can be extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account. This comment clarifies, however, that unless the only credit offered meets the requirements of § 1026.61(a)(4), such a product structure would violate the rules under § 1026.61(b).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 61(a)(3)(i)-1.ii also explains that a credit extension through a negative balance on the asset feature of a prepaid account can occur during the authorization phase of the transaction or in later periods up to the settlement of the transaction. New comment 61(a)(3)(i)-1.iii provides that, for example, credit is extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of a prepaid account where a transaction is initiated using a prepaid card when there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account at the time the transaction is initiated, and credit is extended on the asset feature of the prepaid account when the transaction is authorized. New comment 61(a)(3)(i)-1.iv also provides, for example, that credit is extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of a prepaid account where a transaction occurs when there are sufficient or available funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account at the time of authorization to cover the amount of the transaction but where the consumer does not have sufficient or available funds in the asset feature to cover the transaction at the time of settlement. In this case, credit is extended on the asset feature at settlement to pay those transactions. Also, credit is extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of a prepaid account where a transaction settles even though it was not authorized in advance, and credit is extended through a negative balance on the asset feature at settlement to pay that transaction.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, new § 1026.61(a)(3) is intended to trigger coverage under the credit card rules with respect to such overdraft credit features. New comment 61(a)(3)(ii)-1 explains that new § 1026.61(a)(3)(i) determines whether a prepaid card triggers coverage as a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61(a), and thus, whether a prepaid account issuer is a card issuer under final § 1026.2(a)(7) subject to this regulation, including new § 1026.61(b). However, new § 1026.61(b) requires that any credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card must be structured as a separate credit feature using either a credit subaccount of the prepaid account or a separate credit account. In that case, a card issuer would violate new § 1026.61(b) if it structures the credit feature as a negative balance on the asset feature of the prepaid account, unless the only credit offered in connection with the prepaid account satisfies new § 1026.61(a)(4). A prepaid account issuer can use a negative asset balance structure to extend credit on a prepaid account if the prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card as described in new § 1026.61(a)(4).</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1026.4 Finance Charge</title>
      <analysisParagraph>TILA section 106(a) provides generally that the term “finance charge” in connection with any consumer credit transaction is the sum of all charges, payable directly or indirectly by the person to whom the credit is extended, and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to the extension of credit. The finance charge does not include charges of a type payable in a comparable cash transaction.&lt;footnote ref="615"&gt;15 U.S.C. 1605(a).&lt;/footnote&gt;
          </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Regulation Z generally defines the term “finance charge” in existing § 1026.4(a) to mean “the cost of consumer credit as a dollar amount.” It includes any charge payable directly or indirectly by the consumer and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to or as a condition of the extension of credit. It does not include any charge of a type payable in a comparable cash transaction. However, certain fee or charges are specifically excluded from the current definition of “finance charge,” including as described in existing § 1026.4(c)(3) and (4) respectively: (1) Charges imposed by a financial institution for paying items that overdraw an account, unless the payment of such items and the imposition of the charge were previously agreed upon in writing; and (2) fees charged for participation in a credit plan, whether assessed on an annual or other periodic basis.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail below, the proposal would have revised various components of the definition of finance charge in existing § 1026.4 and its commentary as applied to credit offered in connection with a prepaid account to (1) distinguish credit provided in connection with prepaid accounts addressed by the proposal from overdraft services on checking accounts, which is subject to a different rulemaking; and (2) broaden the definition of “finance charge,” as applied in the prepaid context, to assure broad coverage of the credit card rules to credit plans accessed by prepaid cards that would have been credit cards under the proposal and to better reflect the full cost of credit.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Specifically, the proposal would have provided that existing § 1026.4(c)(3)'s exclusion of fees imposed in connection with overdraft services on checking accounts from the definition of finance charge would not have applied to credit accessed by a prepaid card. It also would have exempted credit accessed by a prepaid card from the exclusion in existing § 1026.4(c)(4) for participation fees. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analyses of § 1026.4(a) and (b) below, the proposal also would have made other modifications to general finance charge precepts as applied to credit offered in connection with prepaid cards, to assure broad coverage of the credit card rules to such credit.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail below, consistent with the goals of the proposal in relation to the definition of “finance charge,” the Bureau is revising the definition of “finance charge” with regard to the covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards as defined under new § 1026.61 to (1) distinguish credit provided in connection with prepaid accounts addressed by the final rule from overdraft services on checking accounts, which is subject to a different rulemaking process; and (2) broaden the definition of “finance charge,” as applied in the prepaid context, to assure broad coverage of the credit card rules to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards and to better reflect the full cost of credit. The Bureau also is adding language to the definition of “finance charge” in existing § 1026.4 and related commentary to provide greater guidance regarding the treatment of fees that are charged to the separate credit subaccount or account accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, as compared to fees charged to the prepaid asset feature. Finally, the Bureau has added commentary to § 1026.4 to provide guidance as to the application of the definition of “finance charge” to credit features accessible by prepaid cards that are not credit cards under the final rule.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z&lt;/em&gt; section above and in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61 below, the Bureau generally intends to cover under Regulation Z overdraft credit features in connection with prepaid accounts where the credit feature is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. New § 1026.61(b) generally requires that such credit features be structured as separate subaccounts or accounts, distinct from the prepaid asset account, to facilitate transparency and compliance with various Regulation Z requirements. New § 1026.61(a)(2)(i) provides that a prepaid card is a “hybrid prepaid-credit card” with respect to such a separate credit feature if the card meets the following two conditions: (1) The card can be used from time to time to access credit from the separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; and (2) the separate credit feature is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. New § 1026.61(a)(2)(i) defines such a separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as a “covered separate credit feature.” The hybrid prepaid-credit card can access both the covered separate credit feature and the asset feature of the prepaid account, and the hybrid prepaid-credit card is a credit card under Regulation Z with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61 below, the Bureau also has decided to exclude prepaid cards from being covered as credit cards under Regulation Z when they access certain specified types of credit. First, new § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii) provides that a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a separate credit feature that does not meet both of the conditions above, for example, where the credit feature is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate or its business partner. Such credit features are defined as “non-covered separate credit features,” as discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below. Second, under new § 1026.61(a)(4), a prepaid card also is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card when the prepaid card accesses incidental credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account where the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit. A prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 or a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) when it accesses credit from these types of credit features. For more detailed explanations of when prepaid cards are not credit cards under Regulation Z, see the section-by-section analyses of § 1026.61(a)(2) and (4) below.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail below, the Bureau is amending existing § 1026.4 and its commentary to (1) distinguish credit provided in connection with prepaid accounts addressed by the final rule from the overdraft services on checking accounts, which is subject to a different rulemaking process; and (2) broaden the definition of “finance charge,” as applied in the prepaid context, to assure broad coverage of the credit card rules to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards and to better reflect the full cost of credit. Specifically, the final rule provides that the exclusion in existing § 1026.4(c)(3) for certain charges in connection with overdraft services on checking accounts does not apply to credit offered in connection with a prepaid account and that the exclusion in existing § 1026.4(c)(4) for participation fees does not apply to a fee to participate in a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61, regardless of whether this fee is imposed on the credit feature or on the asset feature of the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau is amending existing § 1026.4 and its commentary to provide additional clarification and guidance as to what types of fees and charges constitute “finance charges” related to credit offered in connection with a prepaid account. For example, with regard to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, the Bureau has added new § 1026.4(b)(11) and related commentary to address the classification of fees as finance charges depending on whether those fees are imposed on the covered separate credit feature or on the asset feature of the prepaid account. Specifically, new § 1026.4(b)(11) provides that the following fees generally are finance charges with respect to such covered separate credit features and asset features: (1) Any fee or charge, such as interest rates and service, transaction, activity, or carrying charges, imposed on the covered separate credit feature, whether it is structured as a credit subaccount of the prepaid account or a separate credit account; and (2) any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account to the extent that the amount of the fee or charge exceeds comparable fees or charges imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The commentary to new § 1026.4(b)(11) also provides guidance with regard to the treatment of fees imposed on the prepaid account in relation to credit features accessible by prepaid cards that are not hybrid prepaid-credit cards. For example, with regard to non-covered separate credit features, the final rule provides that new § 1026.4(b)(11) and related commentary do not apply to fees or charges imposed on the non-covered separate credit feature; instead, the non-covered credit feature is evaluated in its own right under the general rules set forth in existing § 1026.4 to determine whether these fees or charges are finance charges. In addition, with respect to these non-covered separate credit features, fees or charges on the asset feature of the prepaid account are not finance charges under existing § 1026.4 with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature. The commentary also provides that with respect to incidental credit that is provided via a negative balance on the prepaid account under new § 1026.61(a)(4), fees that can be imposed on the prepaid account under § 1026.61(a)(4) are not finance charges under final § 1026.4.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1026.8 sets forth the requirements for how issuers must describe each credit transaction on the periodic statement. Existing § 1026.8 generally provides that a creditor must identify credit transactions on or with the first periodic statement that reflects the transaction by furnishing certain information. Existing § 1026.8(a) sets forth the requirements for describing a “sale credit” transaction on the periodic statement. A “sale credit” generally means a credit transaction involving the sale of property or services. Existing § 1026.8(b) sets forth the requirements for describing a “nonsale credit” transaction on the periodic statement. A “nonsale credit” transaction generally means a credit transaction that does not involve the sale of property or services.

        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau requested comment on whether once a credit card account has been added to a prepaid card, it should prohibit a card issuer from thereafter assessing a fee for declining to authorize a prepaid card transaction, notwithstanding that a given transaction would not have accessed the credit card account even had it been authorized. Several consumer group commenters indicated that the Bureau should prohibit declined transaction fees on prepaid accounts generally. One of these consumer group commenters indicated that it could be confusing to determine whether a declined transaction would have accessed the prepaid account or a credit feature. This commenter believed that these fees are unfair penalty fees, especially if they exceed the cost (if any) to the prepaid account issuer of the declined transaction.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Also, as discussed in more detail below, several consumer groups requested that the Bureau adopt additional protections under § 1026.52(b) with respect to credit card accounts that are accessed by prepaid cards that are credit cards.

This commenter believed that these fees are unfair penalty fees, especially if they exceed the cost (if any) to the prepaid account issuer of the declined transaction.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting proposed comment 52(b)(2)(i)-7 with revisions to reflect terminology consistent with new § 1026.61.&lt;footnote ref="674"&gt;The proposal would have provided that the term “credit card” includes an account number that is not a prepaid card that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan that allows deposits directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. Proposed comment 52(b)(2)(i)-7 would have provided that the prohibition in § 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(&amp;lt;em data-original="E-03"&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;) applies to declined transaction fees imposed on credit card accounts accessed by such account numbers. For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) above, the final rule does not adopt the proposed changes to comment 52(b)(2)(i)-7 related to these account numbers.&lt;/footnote&gt;

             New comment 52(b)(2)(i)-7 provides that with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in § 1026.61 where the credit feature is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, § 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;) prohibits card issuers from imposing declined transaction fees in connection with the covered separate credit feature, regardless of whether the declined transaction fee is imposed on the credit feature or on the asset feature of the prepaid account. For example, if the hybrid prepaid-credit card attempts to access credit from the covered separate credit feature and the transaction is declined, existing § 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;) prohibits the card issuer from imposing a declined transaction fee, regardless of whether the fee is imposed on the credit feature or on the asset feature of the prepaid account. Fees imposed for declining a transaction that would have only accessed the asset feature of the prepaid account and would not have accessed the covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card are not covered by existing § 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 and a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that a fee for declining a transaction where the prepaid account issuer attempts to access credit from the covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card and the transaction is declined is no different than a fee for declining a credit card transaction, which is prohibited by current § 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;). Thus, such a declined transaction fee is prohibited by final § 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;), regardless of whether the fee is imposed on the credit feature or on the asset feature of the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, several consumer group commenters indicated that the Bureau should prohibit declined transaction fees on prepaid accounts generally. One of these consumer group commenters indicated that it could be confusing to determine whether a declined transaction would have accessed the prepaid account or a credit feature. This commenter believed that these fees are unfair penalty fees, especially if they exceed the cost (if any) to the prepaid account issuer of the declined transaction. Consistent with the proposal, new comment 52(b)(2)(i)-7 makes clear that fees imposed for declining a transaction that would have only accessed the asset feature of the prepaid account and would not have accessed the covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card are not covered by final § 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;). The Bureau does not believe that it is appropriate to apply final § 1026.52(b)(2)(i)(B)(&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;) to fees for declined transactions that would not have accessed the covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card because fees for those declined transactions are not directly related to credit.&lt;footnote ref="675"&gt;As discussed above, certain commenters indicated that declined transaction fees should be prohibited on prepaid accounts generally or should be deemed unfair penalty fees, irrespective of when there is a credit feature in connection with the prepaid account. The Bureau believes such changes are outside the scope of the proposal, and does not make the change at this time. However, the Bureau continues to monitor such fees generally and whether any practices raise concerns. The Bureau further notes, however, that although the Board did not address declined transaction fees in its 2009 rulemaking addressing overdraft services, the Board noted in response to comments received that such fees could raise significant fairness issues under the FTC Act, because the institution bears little, if any, risk or cost to decline authorization of an ATM or one-time debit card transaction. &amp;lt;em data-original="E-03"&amp;gt;See&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; 74 FR 59033, 59041 (Nov. 17, 2009).&lt;/footnote&gt;

The Bureau does not believe it is appropriate at this time to include these clarifications because these requirements are beyond the scope of the proposal, and the Bureau has not collected information about whether there are costs for prepaid account issuers related to the circumstances in which these fees are charged.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Restriction on overdraft fees.&lt;/em&gt; As indicated above, one consumer group commenter indicated that any expenditure not associated with a purchase transaction should not be able to trigger an overdraft fee.

The commenter suggested that the general principle should be that prepaid account issuers should never be able to charge an overdraft fee of any kind if the issuer has not extended a payment to a third party.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau has not adopted a restriction on imposing credit-related fees on a credit extension from a covered separate credit feature unless the credit extension is for a purchase transaction. The requirement is beyond the scope of the proposal. In addition, as discussed above and in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.52(a), the Bureau notes that the provisions in § 1026.52(a) and (b) apply to credit-related fees in connection with covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, as applicable.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>2(a)(15)(iii) Charge Card</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Regulation Z defines the term “charge card” in existing § 1026.2(a)(15)(iii) to mean “a credit card on an account for which no periodic rate is used to compute a finance charge.” Current comment 2(a)(15)-3 provides guidance on how the term “charge card” is used throughout the regulation. In particular, the current comment provides that, in general, charge cards are cards used in connection with an account on which outstanding balances cannot be carried from one billing cycle to another and are payable when a periodic statement is received. This comment also explains that under the regulation, a reference to credit cards generally includes charge cards. In particular, references to credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan in subparts B and G generally include charge cards. The term “charge card” is, however, distinguished from “credit card” or “credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan” in existing §§ 1026.6(b)(2)(xiv), 1026.7(b)(11) and (b)(12), 1026.9(e) and (f), 1026.28(d), 1026.52(b)(1)(ii)(C), and 1026.60, and Appendices G-10 through G-13.

First, the existing text of the comment would have been placed in proposed comment 2(a)(15)-3.i and a new comment 2(a)(15)-3.ii would have been added. Specifically, proposed comment 2(a)(15)-3.ii would have explained that a prepaid card is a charge card if it also is a credit card where no periodic rate is used to compute the finance charge. This proposed comment also would have explained that, unlike other charge cards, a prepaid card that is a charge card that accesses a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan would be subject to the requirements in proposed § 1026.7(b)(11)(i)(A), which would have required payment due dates to be disclosed on periodic statements for a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan. See the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.7(b)(11) below. Thus, under proposed § 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A), for credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, a card issuer of a prepaid card that meets the definition of a charge card would have been required to adopt reasonable procedures designed to ensure that (1) periodic statements for the charge card account accessed by the prepaid card that is a charge card are mailed or delivered at least 21 days prior to the payment due date disclosed on the statement pursuant to proposed § 1026.7(b)(11)(i)(A); and (2) the card issuer does not treat as late for any purposes a required minimum periodic payment on the charge card account received by the card issuer within 21 days after mailing or delivery of the periodic statement disclosing the due date for that payment.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Under the proposal, the existing language in comment 2(a)(15)-3 (which would have been renumbered as proposed comment 2(a)(15)-3.i) would have been revised to be consistent with new proposed comment 2(a)(15)-3.ii and the definition of “charge card.” Currently, the first sentence of comment 2(a)(15)-3 provides that, generally, charge cards are cards used in connection with an account on which an outstanding balance cannot be carried from one billing cycle to another and is payable when a periodic statement is received. This sentence would have been revised to be more consistent with the definition of charge card in existing § 1026.2(a)(15)(iii) to state that charge cards are credit cards where no periodic rate is used to compute the finance charge; no substantive change would have been intended by this proposed revision. In addition, the last sentence of the existing comment would have been revised to cross-reference new proposed comment 2(a)(15)-3.ii.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive specific comments on the proposed changes to comment 2(a)(15)-3. Consistent with the proposal, the final rule places the language of current comment 2(a)(15)-3 in new comment 2(a)(15)-3.i and revises that language as proposed. The Bureau also is adding a new comment 2(a)(15)-3.ii as proposed, with revisions to clarify the intent of the language and to be consistent with new § 1026.61.&lt;footnote ref="607"&gt;The proposal would have provided that the term “credit card” includes an account number that is not a prepaid card that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan that allows deposits directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. Proposed comment 2(a)(15)-3.ii would have provided that such an account number is a charge card if it accesses a credit card account where no periodic rate is used to compute the finance charge. For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) above, the final rule does not adopt the proposed changes to comment 2(a)(15)-3.ii related to these account numbers.&lt;/footnote&gt;
          </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Specifically, new comment 2(a)(15)-3.ii provides that a hybrid prepaid-credit card, as defined in new § 1026.61, is a charge card with respect to a covered separate credit feature if no periodic rate is used to compute the finance charge in connection with the covered separate credit feature. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 and a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>New comment 2(a)(15)-3.ii also explains that, unlike other charge card accounts, the requirements in final § 1026.7(b)(11) apply to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card that is a charge card when that covered separate credit feature is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan. Thus, under final § 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A), with respect to a covered separate credit feature that is a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, a card issuer of a hybrid prepaid-credit card that meets the definition of a charge card because no periodic rate is used to compute a finance charge in connection with the covered separate credit feature must adopt reasonable procedures for the covered separate credit feature designed to ensure that (1) periodic statements are mailed or delivered at least 21 days prior to the payment due date disclosed on the statement pursuant to final § 1026.7(b)(11)(i)(A); and (2) the card issuer does not treat as late for any purposes a required minimum periodic payment received by the card issuer within 21 days after mailing or delivery of the periodic statement disclosing the due date for that payment.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>12(d)(2) Rights of the Card Issuer</title>
      <analysisParagraph>TILA section 169(a) generally prohibits card issuers from taking any action to offset a cardholder's credit card indebtedness against funds of the cardholder held on deposit with the card issuer.&lt;footnote ref="651"&gt;15 U.S.C. 1666h(a).&lt;/footnote&gt;
             TILA section 169(b) provides, however, that the prohibition on offset does not alter or affect the right under State law of a card issuer to attach or otherwise levy upon funds of a cardholder held on deposit with the card issuer if that remedy is constitutionally available to creditors generally.&lt;footnote ref="652"&gt;15 U.S.C. 1666h(b).&lt;/footnote&gt;
          </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Implementing TILA section 169, existing § 1026.12(d)(2) provides that that the prohibition on offsets in existing § 1026.12(d)(1) does not alter or affect the right of a card issuer acting under State or Federal law to attach or otherwise levy upon the funds of a cardholder held on deposit with the card issuer if the same procedure is constitutionally available to creditors generally. Existing § 1026.12(d)(2) also provides two additional methods for obtaining funds that the Board found were not prohibited by the prohibition on offsets in TILA section 169. Specifically, existing § 1026.12(d)(2) provides that the prohibition on offsets in existing § 1026.12(d)(1) does not alter or affect the right of a card issuer acting under State or Federal law to use either of the following two methods if the same method is constitutionally available to creditors generally: (1) Obtain or enforce a consensual security interest in the funds; or (2) obtain or enforce a court order relating to the funds.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Board adopted these additional two methods in 1981 as part of its rulemaking to implement the Truth in Lending Simplification and Reform Act.&lt;footnote ref="653"&gt;46 FR 20848 (Apr. 7, 1981).&lt;/footnote&gt;
             In the supplemental information to that rulemaking, with respect to the method related to security interests, the Board stated its belief that TILA section 169 was not intended to apply to the granting of security interests in cardholders' deposit accounts. In addition, the Board imposed certain limitations on the use of security interests that it believed would prevent circumvention of the offset prohibition because: (1) Only consensual security interests are permitted, and thus the cardholder must affirmatively agree to grant the security interest; (2) the security interest can be enforced only through procedures by which other creditors could enforce their security interests in the same funds; and (3) any security interest granted to secure credit card indebtedness will be disclosed in the card issuer's initial disclosures to the cardholder. The Board considered but rejected limiting the amount of the security interest to a specified amount, reasoning that other third-party creditors are not required to do so. The Board believed that these requirements should eliminate the possibility of unfair surprise to consumers and of unfair advantage for depository institutions over other creditors that Congress sought to avoid in enacting TILA section 169.&lt;footnote ref="654"&gt;46 FR 20848, 20866 (Apr. 7, 1981).&lt;/footnote&gt;
          </analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Existing comment 12(d)(2)-1 is intended to ensure that the security interest is consensual. Specifically, existing comment 12(d)(2)-1 provides that in order to qualify for the exception stated in § 1026.12(d)(2), a security interest must be affirmatively agreed to by the consumer and must be disclosed in the issuer's account-opening disclosures under § 1026.6. The security interest must not be the functional equivalent of a right of offset; as a result, routinely including in agreements contract language indicating that consumers are giving a security interest in any deposit accounts maintained with the issuer does not result in a security interest that falls within the exception in existing § 1026.12(d)(2).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>For a security interest to qualify for the exception under existing § 1026.12(d)(2), as discussed in existing comment 12(d)(2)-1.i and ii, the following conditions must be met: (1) the consumer must be aware that granting a security interest is a condition for the credit card account (or for more favorable account terms) and must specifically intend to grant a security interest in a deposit account; and (2) the security interest must be obtainable and enforceable by creditors generally. If other creditors could not obtain a security interest in the consumer's deposit accounts to the same extent as the card issuer, the security interest is prohibited by existing § 1026.12(d)(2).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Current comment 12(d)(2)-1.i provides that indicia of the consumer's awareness and intent to provide a security interest include at least one of the following (or a substantially similar procedure that evidences the consumer's awareness and intent): (1) Separate signature or initials on the separate agreement indicating that a security interest is being given; (2) placement of the security agreement on a separate page, or otherwise separating the security interest provisions from other contract and disclosure provisions; or (3) reference to a specific amount of deposited funds or to a specific deposit account number.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The proposal would have retained current guidance in comment 12(d)(2)-1.i requiring that the consumer must be aware that granting a security interest is a condition for the credit card account (or for more favorable account terms) and must specifically intend to grant a security interest in a deposit account. The proposal would have moved the current guidance in comment 12(d)(2)-1.i discussing indicia of the consumer's awareness and intent to grant a security interest to proposed comment 12(d)(2)-1.ii and would have amended that comment to indicate that guidance only applies to deposit accounts that are not prepaid accounts. The proposal would have added new comment 12(d)(2)-1.iii discussing indicia of the consumer's awareness and intent to grant a security interest with respect to prepaid accounts. The proposal also would have moved guidance in existing comment 12(d)(2)-1.ii to new proposed comment 12(d)(2)-1.iv; no substantive change would have been intended.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With respect to proposed comment 12(d)(2)-1.iii, the Bureau believed that additional protections may be needed to ensure that consumers understand that they are giving a security interest with respect to credit features that are accessed by prepaid cards that are credit cards. To prevent the security interest from becoming the functional equivalent to an offset, the proposal would have set forth in proposed comment 12(d)(2)-1.iii the steps that card issuers must take to demonstrate a consumer's awareness of and intent to grant a security interest in a prepaid account. Specifically, a card issuer would have been required to meet all the following conditions: (1) In addition to being disclosed in the issuer's account-opening disclosures under § 1026.6, the security agreement must be provided to the consumer in a document separate from the prepaid account agreement and the credit card account agreement; (2) the separate document setting forth the security agreement must be signed by the consumer; (3) the separate document setting forth the security agreement must refer to the prepaid account number and to a specific amount of funds in the prepaid account in which the card issuer is taking a security interest, and these two elements of the document must be separately signed or initialed by the consumer; and (4) the separate document setting forth the security agreement must specifically enumerate the conditions under which the card issuer will enforce the security interest, and each of those conditions must be separately signed or initialed by the consumer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, as a technical revision, the proposal would have added the title “Rights of the card issuer” to § 1026.12(d)(2); no substantive change was intended.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau solicited comment on the approach discussed above. The Bureau also solicited comment on whether these additional protections are sufficient to ensure that security interests do not become the functional equivalent to an offset when a credit card account is directly linked to a prepaid account through an overdraft feature. If these additional protections were not sufficient, the Bureau sought comment on what additional protections would be sufficient to ensure that the security interests taken in prepaid accounts are consensual. Alternatively, the Bureau sought comment on whether it should prohibit a card issuer from obtaining or enforcing any consensual security interest in the funds of a cardholder held in a prepaid account with the card issuer, to ensure that card issuers cannot circumvent the prohibition on offsets by taking routinely a security interest in the prepaid account funds without consumer awareness of the security interest.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive specific comments from industry commenters on proposed comment 12(d)(2)-1.iii. One consumer group commenter indicated that the Bureau should ban card issuers from taking a security interest in prepaid accounts or require they be established only using a separate account. This commenter believed that even with the proposed safeguards, it would be too easy for a card issuer to obtain the consumer's signature on a document. This commenter indicated that at a minimum, the Bureau should require funds from a prepaid card that would be the security interest to be segregated into a different, separate account that is not a transaction account, such as a savings account. In addition, this commenter indicated that the security interest should be limited to the initial deposit.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adopting comment 12(d)(2)-1 as proposed with technical revisions to clarify the intent of the provision and with revisions to be consistent with new § 1026.61. Consistent with the proposal, the final rule retains current guidance in 12(d)(2)-1.i requiring that the consumer must be aware that granting a security interest is a condition for the credit card account (or for more favorable account terms) and must specifically intend to grant a security interest in a deposit account. The final rule also moves the current guidance 1.ii and revises this current guidance to clarify the intent of the provision and to provide that it only applies in relation to credit card accounts other than covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards as defined in § 1026.61. As discussed in more detail below, the final rule also adds new comment 12(d)(2)-1.iii discussing indicia of the consumer's awareness and intent to provide a security interest in relation to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid in comment 12(d)(2)-1.i discussing indicia of the consumer's awareness and intent to provide a security interest to final comment 12(d)(2)—credit cards. The final rule also moves guidance in existing comment 12(d)(2)-1.ii to final comment 12(d)(2)-1.iv; no substantive change is intended. As technical revisions, the final rule adds the title “Rights of the card issuer” to § 1026.12(d)(2) and revises the existing language of § 1026.12(d)(2) to use the phrase “this paragraph (d)” instead of “this paragraph”; no substantive change is intended.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, the Bureau is adopting new comment 12(d)(2)-1.iii as proposed, with technical revisions to clarify the intent of the provision and with revisions to be consistent with new § 1026.61. Specifically, new comment 12(d)(2)-1.iii provides that with respect to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in § 1026.61, for a consumer to show awareness and intent to grant a security interest in a deposit account, including a prepaid account, all of the following conditions must be met: (1) In addition to being disclosed in the issuer's account-opening disclosures under existing § 1026.6, the security agreement must be provided to the consumer in a document separate from the deposit account agreement and the credit card account agreement; (2) the separate document setting forth the security agreement must be signed by the consumer; (3) the separate document setting forth the security agreement must refer to the deposit account number, and to a specific amount of funds in the deposit account in which the card issuer is taking a security interest and these two elements of the document must be separately signed or initialed by the consumer; and (4) the separate document setting forth the security agreement must specifically enumerate the conditions under which the card issuer will enforce the security interest, and each of those conditions must be separately signed or initialed by the consumer.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 and a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that prepaid account issuers may have significant interest in securing credit card debt on a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card by means of the prepaid account. These credit features will always be associated with this linked asset account, and the Bureau believes that prepaid card users who use the cards to obtain consumer credit from a covered separate credit feature are likely to have lower credit scores than credit card users overall. Unlike traditional secured credit cards, these prepaid cards likely would not be marketed as secured credit cards and would not require consumers to establish a new separate account or to set aside specific funds. As a result, prepaid consumers are less likely than secured credit card users to understand that they are required to provide a security interest in the prepaid account in order to receive the covered separate credit feature. In addition, these prepaid consumers may have a need to be able to manage their prepaid accounts very carefully to cover both daily expenses and any credit repayments.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With regard to security interests in connection with covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, the Bureau believes that all of the indicia in new comment 12(d)(2)-2.iii, including delineating a specific dollar amount as being subject to the security interest, will help to ensure that such security interest arrangements do not circumvent the offset provision in TILA section 169 by ensuring that consumers focus careful attention on the consequences of granting security interests so that consumers are better prepared to manage their accounts to both cover daily expenses and repay any credit extensions.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>At this time, the Bureau does not believe that it is necessary to ban security interests in prepaid accounts or to provide that a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card only can be secured by a separate asset account that is not the prepaid account. The Bureau believes that the protections adopted in the final rule are sufficient to protect consumers from security interests taken in prepaid account with respect to a covered separate credit feature from becoming functional equivalents of offsets, but the Bureau will continue to monitor how providers in the prepaid market use consensual security interests.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>12(d)(3) Periodic Deductions</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Implementing TILA section 169, existing § 1026.12(d)(3) provides that the prohibition on offsets set forth in § 1026.12(d)(1) does not prohibit a plan, if authorized in writing by the cardholder, under which the card issuer may periodically deduct all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt from a deposit account held with the card issuer (subject to the limitations in existing § 1026.13(d)(1)).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Neither TILA section 169 nor existing § 1026.12(d)(3) defines “periodically” for purposes of existing § 1026.12(d)(3). The proposal would have added proposed § 1026.12(d)(3)(ii) to provide that with respect to prepaid cards that are credit cards, for purposes of existing § 1026.12(d)(3), “periodically” means no more frequently than once per calendar month. For example, a deduction could be scheduled for each monthly due date disclosed on the applicable periodic statement in accordance with the requirements of proposed § 1026.7(b)(11)(i)(A) or on an earlier date in each calendar month in accordance with a written authorization signed by the consumer. Thus, under proposed § 1026.12(d)(3), with respect to such credit plans accessed by prepaid card that is a credit card, a card issuer would have been permitted to deduct all or a part of the cardholder's credit card debt automatically from the prepaid account or other deposit account held by the card issuer no more frequently than once per month, pursuant to a signed, written authorization by the cardholder to do so. Proposed comment 12(d)(3)-3 would have provided an example to illustrate when card issuers could deduct automatically all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt from a deposit account (such as a prepaid account) held with the card issuer under proposed § 1026.12(d)(3) with respect to credit cards that are also prepaid cards. Proposed comment 12(d)(3)-3 would have provided that with respect to those credit cards, a card issuer would not be prohibited under proposed § 1026.12(d) from periodically deducting all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt from a deposit account (such as a prepaid account) held with the card issuer (subject to the limitations of existing § 1026.13(d)(1)) under a plan that is authorized in writing by the cardholder, so long as the creditor does not deduct all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt from the deposit account (such as a prepaid account) more frequently than once per calendar month, pursuant to such a plan. The proposed comment would have provided the following example: With respect to credit cards that are also prepaid cards, assume that a periodic statement is sent out each month to a cardholder on the first day of the month and the payment due date for the amount due on that statement is the 25th day of each month. In this case, the card issuer would not have been prohibited under proposed § 1026.12(d) from automatically deducting the amount due on the periodic statement on the 25th of each month, or on an earlier date in each calendar month, from a deposit account held by the card issuer if the deductions were pursuant to a plan that was authorized in writing by the cardholder (as discussed in existing comment 12(d)(3)-1) and complied with the limitations in existing § 1026.13(d)(1). Proposed comment 12(d)(3)-3 also would have explained that the card issuer would be prohibited under proposed § 1026.12(d) from automatically deducting all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt from a deposit account (such as a prepaid account) held with the card issuer more frequently than once per calendar month, such as on a daily or weekly basis, or whenever deposits are made to the deposit account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As technical revisions, the proposal also would have: (1) Added the title “Periodic deductions” to § 1026.12(d)(3); and (2) moved existing § 1026.12(d)(3) to proposed § 1026.12(d)(3)(i). No substantive changes would have been intended.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>One credit union service organization indicated that the Bureau should not adopt the proposed definition of “periodically.” This commenter indicated that consumers should have the choice to allow for automatic multiple payments within the same month, like consumers have with other financial products such as traditional credit card programs. This commenter indicated that some consumers may prefer to pay smaller amounts more frequently instead of paying a larger amount once a month.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One consumer group commenter indicated that the preauthorized payment plan exception set forth in existing § 1026.12(d)(3) should not apply to credit features accessed by prepaid cards that are credit cards. Thus, card issuers of those credit features should not be permitted to deduct credit card balances on those credit features from prepaid accounts pursuant to existing § 1026.12(d)(3). Another consumer group commenter indicated that with respect to credit features accessed by prepaid cards that are credit cards, a card issuer should be permitted under proposed § 1026.12(d)(3) to deduct no more than 4 percent of the outstanding balance on a monthly basis from the prepaid account pursuant to the preauthorized payment plan.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>One consumer group commenter indicated that the Bureau should make clear that consumers have the right to revoke authorization for a payment plan described in proposed § 1026.12(d)(3). This commenter indicated that consumers should be able to exercise the right to revoke authorization under existing § 1026.12(d)(3) easily, such as in writing, electronically or orally. One consumer group commenter indicated that the Bureau should monitor the process that card issuers use to gain automatic payment authorization to ensure that it is not coercive or misleading so that consumers understand that they have signed up for it.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail below, the Bureau is adopting § 1026.12(d)(3) as proposed, with revisions to be consistent with new § 1026.61. Consistent with the proposal, the final rule moves the current language in existing § 1026.12(d)(3) to new § 1026.12(d)(3)(i). The final rule also adds new § 1026.12(d)(3)(ii) and new comment 12(d)(3)-3 as proposed, with revisions to be consistent with new § 1026.61. New § 1026.12(d)(3)(ii) provides that with respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, for purposes of § 1026.12(d)(3), “periodically” means no more frequently than once per calendar month. Thus, under new § 1026.12(d)(3)(ii), with respect to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, a card issuer may deduct all or a part of the cardholder's credit card debt on the covered separate credit feature automatically from the prepaid account or other deposit account held by the card issuer no more frequently than once per month, pursuant to a signed, written authorization by the cardholder to do so. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 and a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail below, the Bureau also is amending existing comment 12(d)(3)-2 to provide that a card issuer is not prohibited under final § 1026.12(d) from automatically deducting from the consumer's deposit account any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account that is not a charge imposed as part of the plan under final § 1026.6(b)(3).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also is making three technical revisions to final § 1026.12(d)(3) and related commentary. First, the final rule adds the title “Periodic deductions” to § 1026.12(d)(3). Second, the final rule revises the language of existing § 1026.12(d)(3) (renumbered as final § 1026.12(d)(3)(i)) to use the phrase “this paragraph (d)” rather than “this paragraph.” Third, the final rule revises existing comment 12(d)(3)-1.iii, which references EFTA section 913, to also reference final Regulation E § 1005.10(e), which implements that section of EFTA.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Definition of “periodically.”&lt;/em&gt; New § 1026.12(d)(3)(ii) provides that with respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, for purposes of final § 1026.12(d)(3), “periodically” means no more frequently than once per calendar month. For example, a deduction could be scheduled for each monthly due date disclosed on the applicable periodic statement in accordance with the requirements of final § 1026.7(b)(11)(i)(A) or on an earlier date in each calendar month in accordance with a written authorization signed by the consumer. Thus, under final § 1026.12(d)(3), with respect to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, a card issuer may deduct all or a part of the cardholder's credit card debt on the covered separate credit feature automatically from the prepaid account or other deposit account held by the card issuer no more frequently than once per month, pursuant to a signed, written authorization by the cardholder to do so.&lt;footnote ref="655"&gt;The proposal would have provided that the term “credit card” includes an account number that is not a prepaid card that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan that allows deposits directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. With respect to these account numbers, the proposal would have set forth a new proposed § 1026.12(d)(3)(ii) and comment 12(d)(3)-3 that would have provided that for purposes of the exception for automatic payment plans as discussed in § 1026.12(d)(3), “periodically” would have meant no more frequently than once per calendar month. For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(15)(i)above, the final rule does not adopt the proposed revisions to § 1026.12(d)(3)(ii) and comment 12(d)(3)-3 related to these account numbers.&lt;/footnote&gt;
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also is adopting comment 12(d)(3)-3 as proposed, with revisions to be consistent with new § 1026.61. New comment 12(d)(3)-3 provides that with respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, a card issuer would not be prohibited under final § 1026.12(d) from periodically deducting all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt on the covered separate credit feature from a deposit account (such as a prepaid account) held with the card issuer (subject to the limitations of existing § 1026.13(d)(1)) under a plan that is authorized in writing by the cardholder, so long as the creditor does not deduct all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt from the deposit account more frequently than once per calendar month pursuant to such a plan.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>This comment provides the following example: With respect to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, assume that a periodic statement is sent out each month to a cardholder on the first day of the month and the payment due date for the amount due on that statement is the 25th day of each month. In this case, the card issuer is not prohibited under final § 1026.12(d) from automatically deducting the amount due on the periodic statement on the 25th of each month, or on an earlier date in each calendar month, from a deposit account held by the card issuer, if the deductions are pursuant to a plan that is authorized in writing by the cardholder (as discussed in final comment 12(d)(3)-1) and comply with the limitations in existing § 1026.13(d)(1). New comment 12(d)(3)-3 also explains that the card issuer is prohibited under final § 1026.12(d) from automatically deducting all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt on the covered separate credit feature from a deposit account (such as a prepaid account) held with the card issuer more frequently than once per calendar month, such as on a daily or weekly basis, or whenever deposits are made or expected to be made to the deposit account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that allowing a card issuer to execute a preauthorized transfer once per calendar month to repay all or some of a consumer's credit card balance on a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card is appropriate because card issuers of covered separate credit features linked to prepaid accounts generally are restricted from providing periodic statements more frequently than on a monthly basis, and the due date must be the same day of the month for each billing cycle. As discussed in the section-by-section analyses of §§ 1026.5(b)(2)(ii) and 1026.7(b)(11) above, for covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards that are credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, the card issuer must adopt reasonable procedures to ensure that periodic statements are mailed or delivered at least 21 days prior to the payment due date disclosed on the periodic statement, and the due date must be the same day of the month for each billing cycle.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is concerned that, with respect to covered separate credit features that are accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, some card issuers may attempt to circumvent the prohibition on offsets by obtaining a consumer's written authorization to deduct all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt on the covered separate credit feature on a daily or weekly basis from the prepaid account to help ensure that the debt is repaid. If “periodically” is not defined for purposes of final § 1026.12(d)(3), the Bureau believes that card issuers that offer covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards may obtain a consumer's written authorization to daily or weekly debits to the prepaid account to repay the credit card debt on the covered separate credit feature given the overall creditworthiness of prepaid accountholders who rely on covered separate credit features. In addition, the Bureau believes prepaid consumers may grant the authorization more readily than other credit cardholders because these consumers may believe that providing such authorization is required.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>An appropriate interval for “periodic[]” deduction plans may depend on the facts and circumstances of the particular credit feature, but because of the above reasons, the Bureau believes that an appropriate interval for covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards is no more frequently than once per calendar month.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that the requirement in final § 1026.12(d)(3), along with changes to the timing requirement for a periodic statement in final § 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A) and the compulsory use provision in Regulation E (final § 1005.10(e)(1)), are necessary to fully effectuate the intent of the provisions and would allow consumers to retain control over the funds in their prepaid accounts even when a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card becomes associated with that account, which is consistent with the prohibition on offsets. In particular, with these changes, such card issuers (1) are required to adopt reasonable procedures designed to ensure that periodic statements for covered separate credit features are mailed or delivered at least 21 days prior to the payment due date disclosed on the periodic statement, and the due date disclosed must be the same day of the month for each billing cycle; (2) can move funds automatically from the asset account held by the card issuer to the credit card account held by the card issuer to pay some or all of the credit card debt on covered separate credit features no more frequently than once per month, such as on the payment due date (pursuant to the consumer's signed, written agreement that the issuer may do so); and (3) are required to offer consumers a means to repay their outstanding credit balances on covered separate credit features other than automatic repayment (such as by means of a transfer of funds from the asset account to the credit account that the consumer initiates on the prepaid account's online banking Web site).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, one credit union service organization indicated that the Bureau should not adopt the proposed definition of “periodically.” This commenter indicated that consumers should have the choice to allow for automatic multiple payments within the same month, like consumers have with other financial products such as traditional credit card programs. This commenter indicated that some consumers may prefer to pay smaller amounts more frequently instead of paying a larger amount once a month. The Bureau notes that under existing comment 12(d)(3)-2.ii, a card issuer is not prohibited under the offset provision in § 1026.12(d)(1) from debiting the cardholder's deposit account on the cardholder's specific request rather than on an automatic periodic basis (for example, a cardholder might check a box on the credit card bill stub, requesting the issuer to debit the cardholder's account to pay that bill). Thus, under the final rule, a consumer may still provide specific requests for payment more frequently than once per month as described in existing comment 12(d)(3)-2.ii (for example, a cardholder might check a box on the credit card bill stub, requesting the issuer to debit the cardholder's account to pay that bill), so long as those payments are not on an automatic periodic basis more frequently than once per month.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, as discussed above, one consumer group commenter indicated that the preauthorized payment plan exception set forth in existing § 1026.12(d)(3) should not apply to credit features accessed by prepaid cards that are credit cards. Thus, card issuers of those credit features should not be permitted to deduct credit card balances on those credit features from prepaid accounts pursuant to existing § 1026.12(d)(3). Another consumer group commenter indicated that with respect to credit features accessed by prepaid cards that are credit cards, a card issuer should be permitted under proposed § 1026.12(d)(3) to deduct no more than 4 percent of the outstanding balance on a monthly basis from the prepaid account pursuant to the preauthorized payment plan. The Bureau does not adopt these additional protections suggested by these commenters at this time. The Bureau believes that the requirement in final § 1026.12(d)(3), along with changes to the timing requirement for a periodic statement in final § 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A) and the compulsory use provision in Regulation E (final § 1005.10(e)(1)), provide sufficient protections to consumers to help ensure that consumers retain control over the funds in their prepaid accounts even when a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card becomes associated with that account, which is consistent with the prohibition on offsets. The Bureau will continue to monitor the use of automatic payment plans.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Also, as discussed above, one consumer group commenter indicated that the Bureau should make clear that consumers have the right to revoke authorization for a payment plan, described in proposed § 1026.12(d)(3). This commenter indicated that consumers should be able to exercise the right to revoke authorization under existing § 1026.12(d)(3) easily, such as in writing, electronically or orally. Another consumer group commenter indicated that the Bureau should monitor the process that card issuers use to gain automatic payment authorization to ensure that it is not coercive or misleading so that consumers understand that they have signed up for it.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The final rule does not provide specific guidance on how consumers may revoke the authorization provided pursuant to final § 1026.12(d)(3). The Bureau notes that under final § 1026.12(d)(3), the exception from the offset provision for automatic payments only applies to automatic payment plans that are “authorized” in writing by the cardholder. At this time, the Bureau believes that State or other applicable law, including UDAAP law, should determine whether an automatic payment plan has been “authorized” and when an authorization has been revoked for purposes of final § 1026.12(d)(3). The Bureau will continue to monitor the processes that card issuers use to gain automatic payment authorization and the processes by which consumers can revoke authorization, to ensure that processes provided by card issuers for obtaining authorization are understandable to consumers and that consumers have reasonable methods available to revoke the authorization.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account that are not charges imposed as part of the plan.&lt;/em&gt; Existing § 1026.12(d)(1) provides that a card issuer may not take any action, either before or after termination of credit card privileges, to offset a cardholder's indebtedness arising from a consumer credit transaction under the relevant credit card plan against funds of the cardholder held on deposit with the card issuer. Existing comment 12(d)(1)-3 provides that the offset prohibition applies to any indebtedness arising from transactions under a credit card plan, including accrued finance charges and other charges on the account. Existing comment 12(d)(3)-2 provides that § 1026.12(d)(1) does not prohibit a card issuer from automatically deducting charges for participation in a program of banking services (one aspect of which may be a credit card plan).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not propose revisions to existing comments 12(d)(1)-3 or 12(d)(3)-2. Nonetheless, as discussed in more detail below, the Bureau is adopting revisions to comment 12(d)(3)-2 to be consistent with new § 1026.61, changes in the final rule to the definition of “finance charge” in final § 1026.4, and the definition of “charges imposed as part of the plan” in final § 1026.6(b)(3). To reflect these changes and to facilitate compliance with § 1026.12(d), the Bureau is adding comment 12(d)(3)-2.iii to provide that the offset prohibition in final § 1026.12(d) does not prohibit a card issuer from automatically deducting any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account that is not a charge imposed as part of the plan under final § 1026.6(b)(3) from a consumer's deposit account, such a prepaid account, held by the card issuer. This clarification applies to both covered separate credit features accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card and non-covered separate credit features that are subject to final § 1026.12(d).&lt;footnote ref="656"&gt;With respect to incidental credit that meets the conditions set forth in new § 1026.61(a)(4), new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(C) makes clear that a prepaid account issuer may still satisfy the exception in new § 1026.61(a)(4) even if it debits fees or charges from the asset feature when there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the asset feature to cover those fees or charges at the time they are imposed, so long as those fees or charges are not credit-related fees enumerated in new § 1026.61(a)(4)(ii)(B). New comment 61(a)(4)-1.iv.A states that for this type of credit, the prepaid account issuer is not a card issuer under § 1026.2(a)(7) with respect to the prepaid card.&lt;/footnote&gt;
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, new § 1026.61(a)(2)(i) provides that a prepaid card is a “hybrid prepaid-credit card” with respect to a separate credit feature if the card meets the following two conditions: (1) The card can be used from time to time to access credit from the separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; and (2) the separate credit feature is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. New § 1026.61(a)(2)(i) defines such a separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as a “covered separate credit feature.” Thus, the hybrid prepaid-credit card can access both the covered separate credit feature and the asset feature of the prepaid account, and the hybrid prepaid-credit card is a credit card under Regulation Z with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Nonetheless, new § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii) provides that a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a separate credit feature that does not meet both of the conditions above, for example, where the credit feature is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate or its business partner. As described in new § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii), a non-covered separate credit feature is not subject to the rules applicable to hybrid prepaid-credit cards; however, it typically will be subject to Regulation Z depending on its own terms and conditions, independent of the connection to the prepaid account. Thus, a non-covered separate credit feature may be subject to the provisions in § 1026.12(d) in its own right based on the terms and conditions of the non-covered separate credit feature, independent of the connection to the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.6(b)(3) above, the Bureau is adding new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D) and new comment 6(b)(3)(iii)(D)-1 which provide that with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61, the term “charges imposed as part of the plan” does not include any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account to the extent that the amount of the fee or charge does not exceed comparable fees or charges imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have a credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. As described in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.4(b)(11) above, these fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are not finance charges under new § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii). With respect to a covered separate credit feature, new comment 12(d)(3)-2.iii makes clear that final § 1026.12(d) does not prevent a card issuer from automatically deducting from a consumer's deposit account, such as a prepaid account, held with the card issuer any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account that is not a charge imposed as part of the plan under new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D) with respect to the covered separate credit feature. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analyses of §§ 1026.4 and 1026.6, the Bureau believes that fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account that are not finance charges, and thus are not charges imposed as part of the plan under new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D), are more appropriately regulated under Regulation E than under Regulation Z with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also is adding new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(E) and new comment 6(b)(3)(iii)(E)-1, which provide that with regard to a non-covered separate credit feature accessible by a prepaid card, as defined in § 1026.61, the term “charges imposed as part of the plan” does not include any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account. New comment 61(b)(3)(iii)(E)-1 also cross-references new comment 4(b)(11)-1.ii.B, which provides that fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are not finance charges with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature. With respect to a non-covered separate credit feature, new comment 12(d)(3)-2.iii makes clear that final § 1026.12(d) does not prevent a card issuer from automatically deducting from a consumer's deposit account, such as a prepaid account, held with the card issuer any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account that is not a charge imposed as part of the plan under new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(E) with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature. Because none of the fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are charges imposed as part of the plan with respect to a non-covered separate credit feature under new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(E), final § 1026.12(d) does not prevent a card issuer from automatically deducting any of these fees or charges from a consumer's deposit account, such as a prepaid account, held with the card issuer. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analyses of §§ 1026.4 and 1026.6, the Bureau believes that fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account are more appropriately regulated under Regulation E rather than Regulation Z with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>12(d)(1) General Rule</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1026.12(d)(1) provides that a card issuer may not take any action, either before or after termination of credit card privileges, to offset a cardholder's indebtedness arising from a consumer credit transaction under the relevant credit card plan against funds of the cardholder held on deposit with the card issuer.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The proposal would have provided that the term “credit card” includes a prepaid card (including a prepaid card that is solely an account number) that is a single device that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan, except if that prepaid card only accesses credit that is not subject to any finance charge, as defined in § 1026.4, or any fee described in § 1026.4(c), and is not payable by written agreement in more than four installments. Thus, under the proposal, the offset provision in existing § 1026.12(d) would have applied to credit plans that are accessed by prepaid cards that are credit cards under the proposal. The proposal also would have added proposed comment 12(d)-1 to make clear that for purposes of the prohibition on offsets in existing § 1026.12(d), funds of the cardholder held on deposit include funds in a consumer's prepaid account and the term deposit account includes a prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Existing comment 12(d)(1)-2 provides that if the consumer tenders funds as a deposit (to a checking account, for example) held by the card issuer, the card issuer may not apply the funds to repay indebtedness on the consumer's credit card account. The proposal would have amended this comment to provide guidance on the tender of funds as a deposit to a prepaid account. Specifically, this comment would have been revised to specify that if the card issuer receives funds designated for the consumer's prepaid account with the issuer, such as by means of an ACH deposit or cash reload, the card issuer may not automatically apply the funds to repay indebtedness on the consumer's credit card account. As a technical revision, the proposal also would have added the title “General rule” to existing § 1026.12(d)(1); no substantive change would have been intended by this addition.</analysisParagraph>

      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Several commenters, including industry trade associations and issuing banks, opposed applying the offset provision to overdrafts on prepaid accounts. One of these commenters indicated that applying the offset provision to overdraft credit features accessed by prepaid cards would deny consumers the ability to access short-term credit in connection with prepaid accounts. Another of these industry commenters believed that when a prepaid account user overdraws his account, the consumer likely intends funds subsequently deposited into the prepaid account to satisfy the overdraft. This industry commenter believed that the offset provision would prevent a consumer from achieving that expected outcome and could mislead prepaid account users into thinking they have more funds available than they actually do. Another of these industry commenters indicated that the offset prohibition would increase the cost of credit to consumers. This commenter indicated that the offset prohibition would make it more difficult for creditors to recover debts owed to them. This commenter indicated the longer and more difficult it is for creditors to recover debts, the more costly it is for consumers to access credit.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Several consumer groups supported application of the offset provision to prepaid cards that would have been credit cards under the proposal. One consumer group commenter urged the Bureau to make clear that payroll deduction plans are covered by the offset prohibition.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>The Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Consistent with the proposal, the final rule adds the title “General rule”&lt;em data-original="E-03"/&gt; to existing § 1026.12(d)(1); no substantive change is intended. The Bureau also is adopting comments 12(d)-1 and 12(d)(1)-2 as proposed with revisions to refer to § 1026.61 for the definition of “prepaid account.”</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Pursuant to the final rule, the offset prohibition in existing § 1026.12(d) applies to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards because these credit features are credit card accounts under the final rule.&lt;footnote ref="650"&gt;The proposal would have provided that the term “credit card” includes an account number that is not a prepaid card where that account number accesses a credit plan where extensions of credit are permitted to be deposited directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. The proposal would have applied the offset prohibition in § 1026.12(d) to credit card accounts accessed by such account numbers. For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) above, the offset prohibition does not apply to accounts simply because they are accessed by these account numbers because under the final rule, these account numbers are not credit cards.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 and a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, several commenters, including industry trade associations and issuing banks, opposed applying the offset provision to overdrafts on prepaid accounts. One of these commenters indicated that applying the offset provision to overdraft credit features accessed by prepaid cards would deny consumers the ability to access short-term credit in connection with prepaid accounts. One industry commenter indicated that the offset prohibition would increase the cost of credit to consumers by making it more difficult for creditors to recover debts owed to them. For the reasons set forth in the &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z&lt;/em&gt; section, the Bureau believes that covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards should receive the important protections that apply to credit card accounts generally under Regulation Z, including the offset prohibitions in final § 1026.12(d). The Bureau also believes that additional protections with respect to the offset provision in final § 1026.12(d) are needed with respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, as discussed in the section-by-section discussion of § 1026.12(d)(2) and (3). The Bureau believes that the requirements in final § 1026.12(d), along with changes to the timing requirement for a periodic statement in final § 1026.5(b)(2)(ii)(A) and the compulsory use provision in Regulation E (final § 1005.10(e)(1)), are important protections that will allow consumers to retain control over the funds in their prepaid accounts if a covered separate credit feature becomes associated with those accounts because they will be able to control when and how debts are repaid.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, one industry commenter believed that when a prepaid account user overdraws his account, the consumer likely intends funds subsequently deposited into the prepaid account to satisfy the overdraft. This industry commenter believed that the offset provision would prevent a consumer from achieving that expected outcome and could mislead prepaid account users into thinking they have more funds available than they actually do. The Bureau believes that the Regulation Z account-opening disclosures and periodic statement disclosures, as well as explanations of contractual terms that card issuers typically provide to consumers, will help ensure that consumers understand the terms of their covered separate credit features, including how to make payments on the credit card accounts.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, one consumer group commenter urged the Bureau to make clear that payroll deduction plans are covered by the offset prohibition. The Bureau has not added any additional guidance in final § 1026.12(d) or its related commentary regarding the applicability of the offset provision to payroll deduction plans. The Bureau does not believe that special guidance related to payroll deduction plans is necessary. The Bureau believes that under the current offset provision (and the final rule), the offset provision would apply to payroll deductions that are deposited into a consumer's asset account that is held by the credit card issuer. Nonetheless, the offset provision does not apply if the payroll deductions are deposited into a consumer's asset account that is held with the employer or with a person other than the credit card issuer. The offset provision also would not apply to payroll deductions that are used directly to pay a covered separate credit feature that is accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card where payroll deduction funds are never deposited into a consumer's asset account with the credit card issuer.</analysisParagraph>

Existing comment 10(a)-2 provides guidance on the term “date of receipt” as used in existing § 1026.10(a). Specifically, existing comment 10(a)-2 provides that the “date of receipt” is the date that the payment instrument or other means of completing the payment reaches the creditor. Existing comment 10(a)-2.ii provides an example illustrating the date of receipt for payments related to payroll deduction plans. Specifically, existing comment 10(a)-2.ii provides that in a payroll deduction plan in which funds are deposited to an asset account held by the creditor, and from which payments are made periodically to an open-end credit account, payment is received on the date when it is debited to the asset account (rather than on the date of the deposit), provided the payroll deduction method is voluntary and the consumer retains use of the funds until the contractual payment date.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The proposal would have amended this comment to reference proposed changes that would have been added to proposed § 1026.12(d)(3) related to the prohibition on offsets. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.12(d) below, existing § 1026.12(d)(1) provides that a card issuer may not take any action, either before or after termination of credit card privileges, to offset a cardholder's indebtedness arising from a consumer credit transaction under the relevant credit card plan against funds of the cardholder held on deposit with the card issuer. Nonetheless, existing § 1026.12(d)(3) provides that the prohibition on offsets does not prohibit a plan, if authorized in writing by the cardholder, under which the card issuer may periodically deduct all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt from a deposit account held with the card issuer (subject to the limitations in existing § 1026.13(d)(1)). With respect to credit cards that are also prepaid cards, the proposal would have added proposed § 1026.12(d)(3)(ii) to define “periodically” to mean no more frequently than once per calendar month. Thus, under proposed § 1026.12(d)(3), with respect to such credit card accounts that would have been accessed by a prepaid card that is a credit card, a card issuer would have been permitted to deduct automatically all or a part of the cardholder's credit card debt from the prepaid account or other deposit account held by the card issuer no more frequently than once per month, pursuant to a signed, written authorization by the cardholder to do so.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The proposal would have revised existing comment 10(a)-2.ii to explain that proposed § 1026.12(d)(3)(ii) prevents card issuers, with respect to credit card accounts accessed by prepaid cards that are credit cards, from automatically deducting credit card account payments from a prepaid account or other deposit account held by the card issuer more frequently than once per calendar month. In a payroll deduction plan in which funds are deposited to a prepaid account held by the creditor, and from which payments are made on a monthly basis to a credit card account accessed by a prepaid card that is a credit card, payment would have been considered to be received on the date when it is debited to the prepaid account (rather than on the date of the deposit), provided the payroll deduction method is voluntary and the consumer retains use of the funds until the contractual payment date.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comment on this aspect of the proposal. The Bureau is adopting revisions to existing comment 10(a)-2.ii as proposed, with technical revisions to clarify the intent of the provision and to be consistent with new § 1026.61.&lt;footnote ref="640"&gt;The proposal would have provided that the term “credit card” includes an account number that is not a prepaid card that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan that allows deposits directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. The proposal would have revised comment 10(a)-2.ii to explain that § 1026.12(d)(3)(ii) prevents card issuers, with respect to credit card accounts accessed by such account numbers, from automatically deducting credit card account payments from a prepaid account or other deposit account held by the card issuer more frequently than once per calendar month. For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(15)(i)above, the final rule does not adopt the proposed changes to comment 10(a)-2.ii related to these account numbers.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             Final comment 10(a)-2.ii explains that in a payroll deduction plan in which funds are deposited to an asset account held by the creditor, and from which payments are made periodically to an open-end credit account, payment is received on the date when it is debited to the asset account (rather than on the date of the deposit), provided the payroll deduction method is voluntary and the consumer retains use of the funds until the contractual payment date. The comment also explains that final § 1026.12(d)(3)(ii) defines “periodically” to mean no more frequently than once per calendar month for payments made periodically from a deposit account, such as prepaid account, held by a card issuer to pay credit card debt incurred with respect to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61 that is held by the card issuer. In a payroll deduction plan in which funds are deposited to a prepaid account held by the card issuer, and from which payments are made on a monthly basis to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card that is held by the card issuer, payment is received on the date when it is debited to the prepaid account (rather than on the date of the deposit), provided the payroll deduction method is voluntary and the consumer retains use of the funds until the contractual payment date. As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 and a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>

      <title>Section 1026.6 Account-Opening Disclosures</title>
      <analysisParagraph>TILA section 127(a) requires creditors to provide consumers with information about key credit terms before opening an open-end account or a credit card account, such as rates and fees that may be assessed on the account.&lt;footnote ref="630"&gt;15 U.S.C. 1637(a); &amp;lt;em data-original="E-03"&amp;gt;see also&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; 15 U.S.C. 1602(g).&lt;/footnote&gt;
             This TILA provision is implemented in existing § 1026.6.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1026.6(b) sets forth the account-opening disclosures that must be provided with respect to open-end credit or credit card accounts that are not home-secured. Under existing § 1026.6(b)(1) and (2), certain account-opening disclosures must be disclosed in a tabular format. These disclosures include: (1) The APRs applicable to the account for purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers; (2) any annual or other periodic fee, expressed as an annualized amount, that is imposed for the issuance or availability of a credit account, including any fee based on account activity or inactivity; (3) any non-periodic fees related to opening the account, such as one-time membership or participation fees; (4) any minimum or fixed finance charge that could be imposed during a billing cycle; (5) any transaction charge imposed on purchases, cash advances or balance transfers; (6) any late payment fees, over the limit fees, or returned payment fees; (7) whether a grace period on transactions applies; (8) the name of the balance computation method used to determine the balance for each feature on the credit account; (9) any fees for required insurance, debt cancellation, or debt suspension coverage; and (10) if the fees imposed at account opening are 15 percent or more of the minimum credit limit for the credit account, disclosures about the available credit that will remain after those fees are imposed.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1026.6(b)(3) sets forth general disclosure requirements about costs imposed as part of the plan. Specifically, existing § 1026.6(b)(3) provides that a creditor must disclose, to the extent applicable: (1) For charges imposed as part of an open-end (not home-secured) plan, the circumstances under which the charge may be imposed, including the amount of the charge or an explanation of how the charge is determined; and (2) for finance charges, a statement of when the charge begins to accrue and an explanation of whether or not any time period exists within which any credit that has been extended may be repaid without incurring the charge.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1026.6(b)(3)(ii) provides that charges imposed as part of the plan are: (1) Finance charges identified under existing § 1026.4(a) and (b); (2) charges resulting from the consumer's failure to use the plan as agreed, except amounts payable for collection activity after default, attorney's fees whether or not automatically imposed, and post-judgment interest rates permitted by law; (3) taxes imposed on the credit transaction by a State or other governmental body, such as documentary stamp taxes on cash advances; (4) charges for which the payment, or nonpayment, affect the consumer's access to the plan, the duration of the plan, the amount of credit extended, the period for which credit is extended, or the timing or method of billing or payment; (5) charges imposed for terminating a plan; and (6) charges for voluntary credit insurance, debt cancellation, or debt suspension.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii) provides that charges that are not imposed as part of the plan include: (1) Charges imposed on a cardholder by an institution other than the card issuer for the use of the other institution's ATM in a shared or interchange system; (2) a charge for a package of services that includes an open-end credit feature, if the fee is required whether or not the open-end credit feature is included and the non-credit services are not merely incidental to the credit feature; and (3) charges under § 1026.4(e) which are disclosed as specified.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1026.5(b)(1) provides that charges imposed as part of the plan that must be disclosed in the account-opening table under existing § 1026.6(b)(2) must be provided before the first transaction is made under the plan. Charges that are imposed as part of the plan and are not required to be disclosed under existing § 1026.6(b)(2) may be disclosed after account opening but before the consumer agrees to pay or becomes obligated to pay for the charge, provided they are disclosed at a time and in a manner that a consumer would be likely to notice them.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>The proposal did not contain proposed changes to existing § 1026.6(b)(2) and (3). Nonetheless, the Bureau believes that additional guidance is needed with respect to these disclosure requirements given the changes that the final rule makes to the existing definition of “finance charge” in § 1026.4 with respect to credit offered in connection with prepaid accounts. As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.4(b)(11) above, the final rule provides guidance on when fees or charges imposed on prepaid accounts are finance charges under final § 1026.4. Consistent with the changes to the definition of “finance charge” in the final rule, the final rule also provides guidance with respect to the disclosure requirements in § 1026.6(b)(2) and (3).</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed below, to ensure compliance with the disclosure requirements in final § 1026.6(b)(2) and (3), with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature of the prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, the final rule provides guidance on how the account-opening disclosure requirements in final § 1026.6(b)(2) and (3) apply to fees and charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account. Specifically, the final rule provides that, with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature of the prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are not “charges imposed as part of the plan” with respect to the covered separate credit feature to the extent that the amount of the fee or charge does not exceed comparable fees or charges imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. Thus, these fees or charges are not required to be disclosed in the account-opening disclosures pursuant to final § 1026.6(b)(2) and (3) with respect to the covered separate credit feature. As discussed in the section-by-section analyses of Regulation E § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) and (f)(1) above, these fees or charges are required to be disclosed under Regulation E.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>In addition, a non-covered separate credit feature may be subject to the provisions in § 1026.6(b)(2) and (3) in its own right based on the terms and conditions of the non-covered separate credit feature, independent of the connection to the prepaid account. To facilitate compliance, the Bureau also is clarifying that fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are not “charges imposed as part of the plan” with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature. Thus, these fees or charges are not required to be disclosed under final § 1026.6(b)(2) and (3) with respect to that non-covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Covered Separate Credit Features Accessible by Hybrid Prepaid-Credit Cards</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 and a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>With regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature of the prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, the Bureau is adding new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D) and new comment 6(b)(3)(iii)(D)-1 to provide guidance on when a fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account is considered a “charge imposed as part of the plan” under final § 1026.6(b)(3) with respect to the covered separate credit feature. Specifically, new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D) provides that with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, as defined in new § 1026.61, the term “charges imposed as part of the plan” does not include any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account to the extent that the amount of the fee or charge does not exceed comparable fees or charges imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 6(b)(3)(iii)(D)-1.i provides an example of the rule set forth in new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D). For example, assume a prepaid account issuer charges a $0.50 per transaction fee on an asset feature of the prepaid account for purchases when a hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses a covered separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing purchase transactions conducted with the card and a $0.50 transaction fee for purchases that access funds in the asset feature of a prepaid account in the same program without such a credit feature. In this case, the $0.50 fees are comparable. Thus, the $0.50 fee for purchases when a hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses a covered separate credit feature in the course of a transaction conducted with the card is not a charge imposed as part of the plan. However, in this example, if the prepaid account issuer imposes a $1.25 per transaction fee on an asset feature of the prepaid account for purchases when a hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses a covered separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing purchase transactions conducted with the card, the $0.75 excess is a charge imposed as part of the plan with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 6(b)(3)(iii)(D)-1.i also states that this $0.75 excess also is a finance charge under new § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii). New comment 6(b)(3)(iii)(D)-1.ii cross-references new comment 4(b)(11)(ii)-1 for additional illustrations of when a prepaid account issuer is charging comparable per transaction fees or load or transfer fees on the asset feature of the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that without this clarification, with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature of the prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, certain fees imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account that are not finance charges still could be considered charges imposed as part of the plan under existing § 1026.6(b)(3)(ii) with respect to the covered separate credit feature. Specifically, existing § 1026.6(b)(3)(ii)(D) provides that the term “charges imposed as part of the plan” includes “charges for which the payment, or nonpayment, affect the consumer's access to the plan, the duration of the plan, the amount of credit extended, the period for which credit is extended, or the timing or method of billing or payment.” Existing comment 6(b)(3)(ii)-2.i provides that charges for which the payment or nonpayment affect the consumer's access to the plan include “fees for using a card at a creditor's ATM to obtain a cash advance.”</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is concerned that without the clarification in new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D) and new comment 6(b)(3)(iii)(D)-1, with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature of the prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, existing § 1026.6(b)(3)(ii)(D) and existing comment 6(b)(3)(ii)-2.i could be read to include per transaction fees imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account as “charges imposed as part of the plan” with respect to the covered separate credit feature when those fees are imposed for transactions that involve credit extensions from a covered separate credit feature, even if the fee is not a finance charge under new § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii). As a result, any per transaction fees for those transactions would be disclosed under both Regulations Z and E, even if the fee is not a finance charge under new § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii). For example, assume a prepaid account issuer charges $0.50 on prepaid accounts for each transaction that accesses funds in the asset balance of the prepaid account without a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. Also, assume that the prepaid account issuer charges $0.50 per transaction on the asset feature of prepaid accounts in the same prepaid program where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from a covered separate credit feature in the course of a transaction. In this case, the $0.50 per transaction fee imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature is not a finance charge under new § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Nonetheless, if these per transaction fees were “charges imposed as part of the plan” under existing § 1026.6(b)(3)(ii) with respect to the covered separate credit feature, these per transaction fees would need to be disclosed in the Regulation Z account-opening table required by existing § 1026.6(b)(1) and (2) with respect to the covered separate credit feature. In addition, these per transaction fees would need to be disclosed on the Regulation Z periodic statement for the covered separate credit feature in any billing cycles in which they were imposed as set forth in existing § 1026.7(b)(6).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>If disclosure of these per transaction fees were required under Regulation Z, these disclosures would duplicate Regulation E disclosures of the fees that are required under the Regulation E final rule. Pursuant to final Regulation E § 1005.18(b)(4) and (f)(1), these per transaction fees must be disclosed in the long form pre-acquisition disclosure and in the initial disclosures for the prepaid account, respectively, because they are imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account. In addition, under existing Regulation E § 1005.9(b), these per transaction fees must also be disclosed on the Regulation E periodic statement or on the written and electronic transaction histories pursuant to the periodic statement alternative under final Regulation E § 1005.18(c)(1) because these fees are imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See also&lt;/em&gt; final Regulation E § 1005.18(c)(4).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D) and new comment 6(b)(3)(iii)(D)-1 make clear that with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, as defined in new § 1026.61, a fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account is not a “charge imposed as part of the plan” for purposes of Regulation Z with respect to the covered separate credit feature if the fee or charge is not a finance charge under new § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii). As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii), the Bureau believes that to the extent that a prepaid account issuer is charging the same comparable fee on the asset balance of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature as the fee that it charges on a prepaid account in the same prepaid account program without such a credit feature, the fee is not being charged for credit and thus, is not a finance charge. As such, the Bureau believes that these fees are more appropriately disclosed on the Regulation E disclosures for the asset feature of the prepaid account and should not be disclosed as well on the Regulation Z disclosures with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Consistent with new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(D) and new comment 6(b)(3)(iii)(D)-1, with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature of the prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, the Bureau also is adding new commentary to § 1026.6(b)(2) regarding the disclosure of fees imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account in the account-opening table. Specifically, new comment 6(b)(2)-1 provides that with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61, a creditor is required to disclose under existing § 1026.6(b)(2) any fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account that are charges imposed as part of the plan under final § 1026.6(b)(3) to the extent those fees or charges fall within the categories of fees required to be disclosed under existing § 1026.6(b)(2). For example, assume a creditor imposes a $1.25 per transaction fee on an asset feature of the prepaid account for purchases when a hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses a covered separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing purchase transactions conducted with the card and a $0.50 transaction fee for purchases that access funds in the asset feature of a prepaid account in the same program without such a credit feature. In this case, the $0.75 excess is a “charge imposed as part of the plan” under § 1026.6(b)(3) and must be disclosed as a transaction fee for purchases under § 1026.6(b)(2)(iv) in the account-opening table. New comment 6(b)(2)-2 clarifies that a creditor is not required to disclose in the account-opening table under final § 1026.6(b)(2) any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account that is not a charge imposed as part of the plan under final § 1026.6(b)(3).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>To ease compliance risk and burden and for other reasons, with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, the Bureau expects that prepaid account issuers will choose not to impose finance charges on the asset feature of the prepaid account. Instead, the Bureau expects that prepaid account issuers will choose to charge comparable fees on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a linked covered separate credit feature as those charged on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that are not linked to a covered separate credit feature. The Bureau expects that prepaid account issuers will choose to impose finance charges on the credit feature itself, and not on the asset feature of the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As noted above, if a prepaid account issuer does impose finance charges on the asset feature of the prepaid account, as described in new § 1026.4(b)(11)(ii), these finance charges must be disclosed under both Regulations Z and E as applicable. In that case, the prepaid account issuer must coordinate the disclosures under Regulations Z and E and must provide these disclosures in a way that ensures that consumers understand the fees that could be imposed. Nonetheless, as discussed above, the Bureau believes that most prepaid account issuers will choose to avoid imposing finance charges on the asset feature of the prepaid account in order to avoid compliance issues and risks related to providing disclosures with respect to these fees under both Regulations E and Z.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Non-Covered Separate Credit Features</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61 below, the Bureau has decided to exclude prepaid cards from being covered as credit cards under Regulation Z when they access certain specified types of credit. First, under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii), a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a “non-covered separate credit feature,” which means that the separate credit feature either (1) cannot be accessed in the course of a prepaid card transaction to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; or (2) is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. Second, under new § 1026.61(a)(4), a prepaid card also is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card when the prepaid card accesses incidental credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account where the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit. A prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 or a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) when it accesses credit from these types of credit features. For more detailed explanations of when prepaid cards are not credit cards under Regulation Z, see the section-by-section analyses of § 1026.61(a)(2) and (4) below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A non-covered separate credit feature may be subject to the provisions in § 1026.6(b)(2) and (3) in its own right based on the terms and conditions of the non-covered separate credit feature, independent of the connection to the prepaid account. With respect to non-covered separate credit features that are subject to § 1026.6, to facilitate compliance with the disclosure requirements in final § 1026.6(b)(2) and (3), the final rule provides guidance on how the disclosure requirements in final § 1026.6(b)(2) and (3) apply to fees and charges imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account in relation to non-covered separate credit features accessible by prepaid cards. Specifically, new § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(E) and new comment 6(b)(3)(iii)(E)-1 provide that with regard to a non-covered separate credit feature accessible by a prepaid card as defined in new § 1026.61, the term “charges imposed as part of the plan” does not include any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account. New comment 6(b)(3)(iii)(E)-1 also cross-references new comment 4(b)(11)-1.ii.B that provides that fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are not finance charges with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature. New comment 6(b)(2)-2 provides that a creditor is not required to disclose in the account-opening table under final § 1026.6(b)(2) any fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account that is not a charge imposed as part of the plan under final § 1026.6(b)(3). Thus, none of the fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account would be required to be disclosed under final § 1026.6(b) with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above in relation to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards, the Bureau believes that without this clarification, certain fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account that are not finance charges with respect to the non-covered separate credit features still could be considered fees imposed as part of the plan under existing § 1026.6(b)(3)(ii). Specifically, existing § 1026.6(b)(3)(ii)(D) provides that the term “charges imposed as part of the plan” includes “charges for which the payment, or nonpayment, affect the consumer's access to the plan, the duration of the plan, the amount of credit extended, the period for which credit is extended, or the timing or method of billing or payment.” The Bureau is concerned that without this clarification, existing § 1026.6(b)(3)(ii)(D) could be read to include a load or transfer fee imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account as a “charge imposed as part of the plan” with respect to a non-covered separate credit feature when the fee is imposed for a transaction where credit is drawn or transferred from a non-covered separate credit feature, even if the fee is not a finance charge with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature. Without this clarification, the load or transfer fees for those transactions would need to be disclosed under both Regulations Z and E, even if the fee or charge is not a finance charge under § 1026.4.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New § 1026.6(b)(3)(iii)(E) and new comment 6(b)(3)(iii)(E)-1 make clear that with regard to a non-covered separate credit feature accessible by a prepaid card, as defined in new § 1026.61, none of the fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are charges imposed as part of the plan with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature for purposes of Regulation Z. Under new comment 4(b)(11)-1.ii.B, these fees or charges are not finance charges with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature. The Bureau believes that because fees or charges that are imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account are not finance charges under final § 1026.4 with regard to a non-covered separate credit feature, these fees or charges are more appropriately disclosed on the Regulation E disclosures, and they should not be disclosed as well on the Regulation Z disclosures with respect to non-covered separate credit features.

      <title>13(i) Relation to Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E</title>
      <analysisParagraph>Existing § 1026.13(i) provides guidance on whether billing error provisions under Regulation E or Regulation Z apply in certain overdraft-related transactions. Specifically, existing § 1026.13(i) provides that if an extension of credit is incident to an EFT and is under an agreement between a consumer and a financial institution to extend credit when the consumer's account is overdrawn or to maintain a specified minimum balance in the consumer's account, the creditor must comply with the requirements of Regulation E § 1005.11 governing error resolution rather than those of existing § 1026.13(a), (b), (c), (e), (f), and (h). The provisions of existing § 1026.13 (d) and (g) would still apply to the credit portion of these transactions.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z&lt;/em&gt; section, currently under Regulation Z, overdraft credit is subject to Regulation Z only if there is an agreement to extend credit, which is typically described as an overdraft line of credit. In those cases, existing § 1026.13(i) applies when a transaction is partially funded through an EFT from an asset account and partially funded through an overdraft credit line. Such transactions will be subject to both Regulation Z and E. Under existing § 1026.13(i), for those transactions, the creditor must comply with the requirements of Regulation E § 1005.11 governing error resolution rather than those of existing § 1026.13(a), (b), (c), (e), (f), and (h). The provisions of existing § 1026.13(d) and (g) would still apply to the credit portion of these transactions. Currently under Regulation Z, with respect to an asset account with a linked overdraft line of credit: (1) if a transaction only accesses the overdraft line of credit and does not access funds in the asset account, the error resolution provisions in Regulation Z apply, and the error resolution provisions in Regulation E do not apply; and (2) if a transaction only accesses the funds in the asset account and does not access the overdraft line of credit, the error resolution provisions in Regulation E apply, and the error resolution provisions in Regulation Z do not apply. In addition, current Regulation Z does not apply to overdraft credit where there is not an agreement to extend credit. As discussed in existing comment 13(i)-2, overdraft transactions made under those overdraft credit programs are governed solely by the error resolution provisions in Regulation E. Existing comment 13(i)-3 provides an example of the application of existing § 1026.13(i) to transactions where a consumer withdraws money at an ATM machine and activates an overdraft line of credit on the checking account.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisParagraph>As discussed in existing comment 13(i)-1, credit extended directly from a non-overdraft credit line is governed solely by Regulation Z, even though a combined credit card/access device is used to obtain the extension.</analysisParagraph>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>The Bureau's Proposal</title>
        <analysisParagraph>First, the proposal would have moved the existing language of current § 1026.13(i) to proposed § 1026.13(i)(1) and would have revised that language to specify that this provision would apply to asset accounts that are not prepaid accounts. Second, existing comment 13(i)-2 would have been revised to specify that the comment only apply to asset accounts that are not prepaid accounts. Third, existing comment 13(i)-3 would have been revised to specify that the example set forth in that comment only applies to debit cards. Proposed § 1026.2(a)(15)(iv) would have defined “debit card” to mean “any card, plate, or other single device that may be used from time to time to access an asset account other than a prepaid account.” The proposed definition of “debit card” also would have specified that it does not include a prepaid card.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The proposal would have added proposed § 1026.13(i)(2) to provide that with respect to a credit plan in connection with a prepaid account, a creditor must comply with the requirements of existing Regulation E § 1005.11 governing error resolution rather than those of § 1026.13(a), (b), (c), (e), (f), and (h) with respect to an extension of credit incident to an EFT when the consumer's prepaid account is overdrawn if the credit plan is subject to subpart B of this regulation. The provisions of existing § 1026.13(d) and (g) would still apply to the credit portion of these transactions.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The proposal also would have added proposed comment 13(i)-4 to provide guidance on how proposed § 1026.13(i)(2) would have applied to credit plans in connection with prepaid accounts. Specifically, proposed comment 13(i)-4 would have provided that for a credit extension involving a credit plan in connection with a prepaid account that is subject to subpart B, when the credit extension is incident to an EFT and occurs when the prepaid account is overdrawn, whether Regulation E or Regulation Z applies depends on the nature of the transaction. For example, if the transaction solely involves an extension of credit under an overdraft plan and does not include a debit to the prepaid account, the error resolution requirements of Regulation Z would have applied. If the transaction debited a prepaid account only (with no credit extended under the overdraft plan), the provisions of Regulation E would have applied. Nonetheless, under the proposal, if the transaction debits a prepaid account but also draws on an overdraft plan subject to subpart B, a creditor would have been required to comply with the requirements of existing Regulation E § 1005.11 and proposed § 1005.18(e) governing error resolution, rather than those of § 1026.13 (a), (b), (c), (e), (f), and (h).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Proposed comment 13(i)-5 would have explained that an overdraft credit plan would not be subject to subpart B if the credit plan is only accessed by a prepaid card that is not a credit card. Under proposed comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.F, a prepaid card would not have been a credit card if the prepaid card only accesses credit that is not subject to any finance charge, as defined in § 1026.4, or fee described in § 1026.4(c), and is not payable by written agreement in more than four installments. For these types of credit plans, under the proposal, only the error resolution provisions in Regulation E would have applied.</analysisParagraph>
      </analysisSection>
      <analysisSection>
        <title>Comments Received and Final Rule</title>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive comment on this aspect of the proposal. Consistent with the proposal, the Bureau is adopting § 1026.13(i) as proposed, with several technical revisions to clarify the intent of the provision and to be consistent with new § 1026.61.&lt;footnote ref="658"&gt;The proposal would have provided that the term “credit card” includes an account number that is not a prepaid card that may be used from time to time to access a credit plan that allows deposits directly only into particular prepaid accounts specified by the creditor. Existing comment 13(i)-1 would have been revised to explain that with respect to a credit account accessed by such an account number, proposed § 1026.13(i) would not have applied to transfers from that plan to a prepaid account. For the reasons set forth in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) above, the final rule does not adopt the proposed revision to existing comment 13(i)-1 related to these account numbers.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             Consistent with the proposal, the Bureau is moving existing § 1026.13(i) to new § 1026.13(i)(1) and is revising this language to specify that this provision does not apply to transactions involving prepaid accounts as defined in § 1026.61. In addition, the Bureau is revising existing comment 13(i)-2 to make clear that the comment do not apply to transactions involving prepaid accounts defined in § 1026.61. Consistent with the proposal, the final rule also amends final comment 13(i)-3 to make clear that the example set forth in the comment only applies to debit cards. New § 1026.2(a)(5)(iv) defines “debit card” to mean “any card, plate, or other single device that may be used from time to time to access an asset account other than a prepaid account.” The definition of “debit card” also specifies that it does not include a prepaid card.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail below, the Bureau also is adding new § 1026.13(i)(2) to provide guidance on how the error resolution provision in Regulations E and Z apply to transactions with respect to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61. As a technical revision, the Bureau also is revising final § 1026.13(i) to reference the error resolution provisions in both final Regulation E §§ 1005.11 and 1005.18(e) as applicable because the Regulation E error resolution rules that apply to prepaid accounts are set forth in both final §§ 1005.11 and 1005.18(e). Specifically, with respect to covered separate credit features, a creditor must comply with the requirements of final Regulation E §§ 1005.11 and 1005.18(e) governing error resolution rather than those of existing § 1026.13(a), (b), (c), (e), (f), and (h) with respect to an extension of credit incident to an EFT when the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses both funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account and a credit extension from the credit feature with respect to a particular transaction. The provisions of existing § 1026.13(d) and (g) still apply to the credit portions of these transactions. The final rule also is adopting comment 13(i)-4 as proposed with revisions to be consistent with new § 1026.61. The Bureau has revised the guidance in new comment 13(i)-5 to be consistent with new § 1026.61.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Covered Separate Credit Features Accessible by Hybrid Prepaid-Credit Cards</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61(a)(2) below, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card includes an overdraft credit feature offered by a prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner that can be accessed by a prepaid card (except as provided in new § 1026.61(a)(4)). The prepaid card is a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 and a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adding new § 1026.13(i)(2) to provide guidance on how the error resolution provisions in Regulations E and Z apply to transactions with respect to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in new § 1026.61. Specifically, with respect to these credit features, a creditor must comply with the requirements of final Regulation E §§ 1005.11 and 1005.18(e) governing error resolution rather than those of existing § 1026.13(a), (b), (c), (e), (f), and (h) with respect to an extension of credit incident to an EFT when the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses both funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account and a credit extension from the credit feature with respect to a particular transaction. The provisions of existing § 1026.13(d) and (g) still apply to the credit portion of these transactions.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, the Bureau is adopting proposed comment 13(i)-4 with revisions to be consistent with new § 1026.61. New comment 13(i)-4 provides that with respect to a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, whether Regulation E or Regulation Z applies depends on the nature of the transaction. If the transaction solely involves an extension of credit under a covered separate credit feature and does not access funds from the asset feature of the prepaid account, the error resolution requirements of Regulation Z apply. New comment 13(i)-4.i provides the following example: Assume that there is $0 in the asset feature of the prepaid account, and the consumer makes a $25 transaction with the card. The error resolution requirements of Regulation Z apply to the transaction. New comment 13(i)-4.i provides that this is true regardless of whether the $25 of credit is drawn directly from the covered separate credit feature without a transfer to the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the amount of the transaction, or whether the $25 of credit is transferred from the covered separate credit feature to the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the amount of the transaction.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 13(i)-4.ii provides that if the transaction accesses funds from the asset feature of a prepaid account only (with no credit extended under the covered separate credit feature), the provisions of Regulation E apply.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 13(i)-4.iii provides that if the transaction accesses funds from the asset feature of a prepaid account but also involves an extension of credit under the covered separate credit feature, a creditor must comply with the requirements of final Regulation E §§ 1005.11 and 1005.18(e) governing error resolution rather than those of § 1026.13(a), (b), (c), (e), (f), and (h). New comment 13(i)-4.iii provides the following illustration: Assume that there is $10 in the asset feature of the prepaid account, and the consumer makes a $25 transaction with the card. The error resolution requirements of Regulations E and Z apply as described above to the transaction. New comment 13(i)-4.iii also provides that this is true regardless of whether $10 is debited from the asset feature and $15 of credit is drawn directly from the covered separate credit feature without a transfer to the asset feature of the prepaid account to cover the amount of the transaction, or whether $15 of credit is transferred from the covered separate credit feature to the asset feature of the prepaid account and a $25 transaction is debited from the asset feature to cover the amount of the transaction.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>Except with respect to prepaid accounts as defined in § 1026.61, new § 1026.13(i)(1) focuses on whether there is an agreement between a consumer and a financial institution to extend credit when the consumer's account is overdrawn or to maintain a specified minimum balance in the consumer's account, consistent with current § 1026.13(i). On the other hand, for covered separate credit features accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, new § 1026.13(i)(2) applies if credit is extended under a covered separate credit feature that is accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit card and the transaction involves an extension of credit incident to an EFT when the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses both funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account and a credit extension from the credit feature. As described in new comment 61(a)(1)-1, a prepaid card can be a hybrid prepaid-credit card under Regulation Z even if, for example, the person that can extend credit does not agree in writing to extend the credit, the person retains discretion not to extend the credit, or the person does not extend the credit once the consumer has exceeded a certain amount of credit.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau believes that it is appropriate to apply the error resolution procedures in Regulation E generally to transactions that debit a prepaid account but also draw on a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card. The Bureau believes that this approach is consistent with EFTA section 909(c), which applies EFTA's limits on liability for unauthorized use to transactions which involve both an unauthorized EFT and an extension of credit pursuant to an agreement between the consumer and the financial institution to extend such credit to the consumer in the event the consumer's account is overdrawn.&lt;footnote ref="659"&gt;15 U.S.C. 1693g(c).&lt;/footnote&gt;
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>An unauthorized EFT on a prepaid account generally would be subject to the limits on liability in existing Regulation E § 1005.6 and final § 1005.18(e); an unauthorized EFT on a prepaid account also is an error for purposes of the error resolution procedures set forth in existing Regulation E § 1005.11(a)(1) and final § 1005.18(e). Although billing errors under existing § 1026.13(a) include a broader category than only unauthorized use, the Bureau believes it is necessary and proper to exercise its adjustment and exception authority under TILA section 105(a) to apply Regulation E's error resolution provisions and limited Regulation Z error resolution provisions to these transactions, to facilitate compliance with EFTA section 908 and TILA section 161 on error resolution. The Bureau is concerned that conflicting provisions could apply to transactions that debit a prepaid account but also draw on a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card if Regulation E's provisions applied to limits on liability for unauthorized use, and Regulation Z's provisions generally apply to investigation of billing errors, including transactions involving unauthorized use. To avoid these potential conflicts and to facilitate compliance, new § 1026.13(i)(2) requires a creditor to comply with the requirements of final Regulation E §§ 1005.11 and 1005.18(e) governing error resolution, rather than those of § 1026.13(a), (b), (c), (e), (f), and (h), if the transaction debits a prepaid account but also draws on a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. This approach is also consistent with the existing provisions in Regulation E § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv) and Regulation Z § 1026.13(i), which apply Regulation E's liability limitation and error resolution procedures to an extension of credit that is incident to an EFT for overdraft lines of credit accessed by debit cards.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Credit Features That Are Not Accessible by a Hybrid Prepaid-Credit Card</title>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed above, proposed comment 13(i)-5 would have explained that an overdraft credit plan would not be subject to subpart B if the credit plan is only accessed by a prepaid card that is not a credit card. Under proposed comment 2(a)(15)-2.i.F, a prepaid card would not have been a credit card if the prepaid card only accesses credit that is not subject to any finance charge, as defined in § 1026.4, or fee described in § 1026.4(c), and is not payable by written agreement in more than four installments. For these types of credit plans, under the proposal, only the error resolution provisions in Regulation E would have applied.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau did not receive any specific comment on proposed comment 13(i)-5. The Bureau has revised the guidance in new comment 13(i)-5 to be consistent with new § 1026.61 and with revisions to Regulation E § 1005.12(a).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61 below, the Bureau has decided to exclude prepaid cards from being covered as credit cards under Regulation Z when they access certain specified types of credit. First, under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii), a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a “non-covered separate credit feature,” which means that the separate credit feature either (1) cannot be accessed in the course of a prepaid card transaction to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; or (2) is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. A non-covered separate credit feature is not subject to the rules applicable to hybrid prepaid-credit cards; however, it typically will be subject to Regulation Z depending on its own terms and conditions, independent of the connection to the prepaid account. Second, under new § 1026.61(a)(4), a prepaid card also is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card when the prepaid card accesses incidental credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account where the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit. A prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 or a credit card under final § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) when it accesses credit from these types of credit features. For more detailed explanations of when prepaid cards are not credit cards under Regulation Z, see the section-by-section analyses of § 1026.61(a)(2) and (4) below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New comment 13(i)-5 explains that Regulation E § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(C) and (D), and (2)(iii) provide guidance on whether error resolution procedures in Regulations E or Z apply to transactions involving credit features that are accessed by prepaid cards that are not hybrid prepaid-credit cards as defined in § 1026.61. New Regulation E § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(C) provides that with respect to transactions that involve credit extended through a negative balance to the asset feature of a prepaid account that meets the conditions set forth in § 1026.61(a)(4), these transactions are governed solely by error resolution procedures in Regulation E, and Regulation Z does not apply. New Regulation E § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(D) and (2)(iii), taken together, provide that with respect to transactions involving a prepaid account and a non-covered separate credit feature as defined in § 1026.61, a financial institution must comply with Regulation E's error resolution procedures with respect to transactions that access the prepaid account as applicable, and the creditor must comply with Regulation Z's error resolution procedures with respect to transactions that access the non-covered separate credit feature, as applicable.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau notes that overdraft credit features that are exempt under new § 1026.61(a)(4) would not be subject to final § 1026.13(i) because these credit features are not accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards and are not subject to Regulation Z generally (including § 1026.13).</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>A non-covered separate credit feature may be subject to the provisions in § 1026.13 generally in its own right based on the terms and conditions of the non-covered separate credit feature, independent of the connection to the prepaid account. Nonetheless, even if § 1026.13 generally is applicable to a non-covered separate credit feature, final § 1026.13(i) will not be applicable to the credit feature. Instead, the prepaid account issuer must comply with Regulation E with respect to the transactions on the prepaid account, and the creditor must comply with Regulation Z with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature. The Bureau believes that it is appropriate that a non-related third-party creditor must comply only with Regulation Z error resolution procedures with respect to the non-covered separate credit feature even if the credit feature functions as an overdraft credit feature because this creditor may not know that its credit feature is being used as an overdraft credit feature in relation to the prepaid account.</analysisParagraph>

        <title>Subpart G—Special Rules Applicable to Credit Card Accounts and Open-End Credit Offered to College Students</title>
        <analysisParagraph>Except for existing § 1026.60, which concerns certain credit card disclosures, all of the provisions in subpart G implement the Credit CARD Act. The provisions in subpart G that implement the Credit CARD Act generally apply to a “card issuer,” as defined in existing § 1026.2(a)(7), that extends credit under a “credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan,” as defined in existing § 1026.2(a)(15)(ii).&lt;footnote ref="660"&gt;Section 1026.57(c) applies to all open-end credit. That section prohibits a card issuer or creditor from offering a tangible item to a college student on or near a college campus or at an event sponsored by the college to induce the student to apply for or open an open-end credit plan.&lt;/footnote&gt;
             Among other things, subpart G contains provisions to implement the Credit CARD Act that:</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>• Prohibit card issuers from extending credit without assessing the consumer's ability to pay, with special rules regarding the extension of credit to persons under the age of 21.&lt;footnote ref="661"&gt;§ 1026.51.&lt;/footnote&gt;
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>• Restrict the amount of required fees that an issuer can charge during the first year after an account is opened.&lt;footnote ref="662"&gt;§ 1026.52(a)(1).&lt;/footnote&gt;
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>• Limit the amount card issuers can charge for “back-end” penalty fees, such as when a consumer makes a late payment or exceeds his or her credit limit.&lt;footnote ref="663"&gt;§ 1026.52(b)(1).&lt;/footnote&gt;
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>• Ban “declined transaction fees” and other penalty fees where there is no cost to the card issuer associated with the violation of the account agreement.&lt;footnote ref="664"&gt;§ 1026.52(b)(2).&lt;/footnote&gt;
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>• Restrict the circumstances under which card issuers can increase interest rates and certain fees on credit card accounts and establish procedures for doing so.&lt;footnote ref="665"&gt;§§ 1026.55 and 1026.59.&lt;/footnote&gt;
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>• Restrict fees for over-the-limit transactions to one per billing cycle and require that the consumer opt-in to payment of such transactions in order for the fee to be charged.&lt;footnote ref="666"&gt;§ 1026.56.&lt;/footnote&gt;
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>• Require institutions of higher education to publicly disclose agreements with card issuers and limit the marketing of credit cards on or near college campuses.&lt;footnote ref="667"&gt;§ 1026.57.&lt;/footnote&gt;
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>In addition, subpart G also contains existing § 1026.60, which sets forth disclosures that card issuers generally must provide on or with a solicitation or an application to open a credit or charge card account.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is adding a new § 1026.61 which defines when a prepaid card is a credit card under Regulation Z (using the term “hybrid prepaid-credit card”). As discussed in the &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Overview of the Final Rule's Amendments to Regulation Z&lt;/em&gt; section above and in more detail in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61 below, the Bureau generally intends to cover under Regulation Z overdraft credit features in connection with prepaid accounts where the credit features are offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliates, or its business partners. New § 1026.61(b) generally requires that such credit features be structured as separate subaccounts or accounts, distinct from the prepaid asset account, to facilitate transparency and compliance with various Regulation Z requirements. New § 1026.61(a)(2)(i) provides that a prepaid card is a “hybrid prepaid-credit card” with respect to a separate credit feature if the card meets the following two conditions: (1) The card can be used from time to time to access credit from the separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing transactions conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; and (2) the separate credit feature is offered by the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. New § 1026.61(a)(2)(i) defines such a separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as a “covered separate credit feature.” Thus, the hybrid prepaid-credit card can access both the covered separate credit feature and the asset feature of the prepaid account, and the hybrid prepaid-credit card is a credit card under Regulation Z with respect to the covered separate credit feature.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>New § 1026.61(c) (moved from § 1026.12(h) in the proposal) provides that with respect to a covered separate credit feature that could be accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card at any point, a card issuer must not do any of the following until 30 days after the prepaid account has been registered: (1) Open a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card; (2) make a solicitation or provide an application to open a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card; or (3) allow an existing credit feature that was opened prior to the consumer obtaining the prepaid account to become a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.61 below, the Bureau also has decided to exclude prepaid cards from being covered as credit cards under Regulation Z when they access certain specified types of credit. First, under new § 1026.61(a)(2)(ii), a prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a “non-covered separate credit feature,” which means that the separate credit feature either (1) cannot be accessed in the course of a prepaid card transaction to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct P2P transfers; or (2) is offered by an unrelated third party that is not the prepaid account issuer, its affiliate, or its business partner. Second, under new § 1026.61(a)(4), a prepaid card also is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card when the prepaid card accesses incidental credit in the form of a negative balance on the asset account where the prepaid account issuer generally does not charge credit-related fees for the credit. A prepaid card is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card under new § 1026.61 or a credit card under new § 1026.2(a)(15)(i) when it accesses credit from these types of credit features. For more detailed explanations of when prepaid cards are not credit cards under Regulation Z, see the section-by-section analyses of § 1026.61(a)(2) and (4) below.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(20) above, the Bureau anticipates that most covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards will meet the definition of “open-end credit” and that credit will not be home-secured. See the section-by-section analysis of the definition of “credit” in final § 1026.2(a)(14), the definition of “open-end-credit” in final § 1026.2(a)(20), and the definition of “finance charge” in final § 1026.4. In addition, as discussed in the section-by-section analyses of § 1026.2(a)(7), (15)(i), and (ii) above, a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card that is an open-end (not home-secured) credit plan is a “credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan,” and the person issuing the hybrid prepaid-credit card (and its affiliate or business partner if that entity is offering the covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card) are “card issuers.” As a result, pursuant to the final rule, provisions in subpart G generally will apply to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards that are open-end (not home-secured) credit plans.&lt;footnote ref="668"&gt;A person would not be extending open-end credit where the covered separate credit feature accessed by the hybrid prepaid-credit card does not meet the definition of “open-end credit,” such as when a finance charge is not imposed in connection with the credit feature. See the section-by-section analysis of § 1026.2(a)(20) above.&lt;/footnote&gt;
          </analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>As discussed in more detail below, the Bureau is amending commentary to the following provisions to provide guidance on how certain provisions in subpart G would apply to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards that are open-end (not home-secured) credit plans: &lt;footnote ref="669"&gt;One commenter asked the Bureau to provide specific guidance in the commentary to § 1026.51 that modeled income may be used with respect to credit card accounts accessed by prepaid cards that are credit cards to meet the requirements set forth in § 1026.51. The Bureau notes that existing comment 51(a)(1)(i)-5.iv provides that for purposes of § 1026.51(a), a card issuer may consider the consumer's current or reasonably expected income and assets based on information obtained through any empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound model that reasonably estimates a consumer's income or assets, including any income or assets to which the consumer has a reasonable expectation of access. The Bureau notes that this existing guidance in comment 51(a)(1)(i)-5.iv applies to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards that are subject to § 1026.51. The Bureau does not believe that additional guidance is needed with respect to these credit features.&lt;/footnote&gt;

        <analysisParagraph>The final rule also provides guidance on how § 1026.60, which requires disclosures to be provided on or with a solicitation or application to open a credit or charge card account, applies to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards.</analysisParagraph>
        <analysisParagraph>The final rule also provides guidance on how provisions in existing § 1026.52(a) and (b), and in existing §§ 1026.55 and 1026.60, apply to non-covered separate credit features that are accessible by prepaid cards as defined by new § 1026.61. A non-covered separate credit feature may be subject to the provisions in § 1026.52(a) and (b), and in existing §§ 1026.55 and 1026.60, in its own right based on the terms and conditions of the non-covered separate credit feature, independent of the connection to the prepaid account. The final rule provides that with respect to such non-covered separate credit features, the provisions in existing § 1026.52(a) and (b), and in existing §§ 1026.55 and 1026.60, do not apply to fees or charges imposed on a prepaid account in relation to non-covered separate credit features.</analysisParagraph>
