    <content>When a creditor uses the special rule in § 1026.17(c)(6) to disclose credit extensions as multiple transactions, fees and charges must be allocated for purposes of calculating disclosures. In the case of a construction-permanent loan that a creditor chooses to disclose as multiple transactions, the creditor must allocate to the construction transaction finance charges under § 1026.4 and points and fees under § 1026.32(b)(1) that would not be imposed but for the construction financing. For example, inspection and handling fees for the staged disbursement of construction loan proceeds must be included in the disclosures for the construction phase and may not be included in the disclosures for the permanent phase. If a creditor charges separate amounts for finance charges under § 1026.4 and points and fees under § 1026.32(b)(1) for the construction phase and the permanent phase, such amounts must be allocated to the phase for which they are charged. If a creditor charges an origination fee for construction financing only but charges a greater origination fee for construction-permanent financing, the difference between the two fees must be allocated to the permanent phase. All other finance charges under § 1026.4 and points and fees under § 1026.32(b)(1) must be allocated to the permanent financing. Fees and charges that are not used to compute the finance charge under § 1026.4 or points and fees under § 1026.32(b)(1) may be allocated between the transactions in any manner the creditor chooses. For example, a reasonable appraisal fee paid to an independent, third-party appraiser may be allocated in any manner the creditor chooses because it would be excluded from the finance charge pursuant to § 1026.4(c)(7) and excluded from points and fees pursuant to § 1026.32(b)(1)(iii).</content>

    <content>Section 1026.18(g) applies to closed-end transactions, other than transactions that are subject to § 1026.18(s) or § 1026.19(e) and (f). Section 1026.18(s) applies to closed-end transactions secured by real property or a dwelling, unless they are subject to § 1026.19(e) and (f). Section 1026.19(e) and (f) applies to closed-end transactions secured by real property or a cooperative unit, other than reverse mortgages. Thus, if a closed-end consumer credit transaction is secured by real property, a cooperative unit, or a dwelling and the transaction is a reverse mortgage or the dwelling is personal property but not a cooperative unit, then the creditor discloses an interest rate and payment summary table in accordance with § 1026.18(s). See comment 18(s)-4. If a closed-end consumer credit transaction is secured by real property or a cooperative unit and is not a reverse mortgage, the creditor discloses a projected payments table in accordance with §§ 1026.37(c) and 1026.38(c), as required by § 1026.19(e) and (f). In all such cases, the creditor is not subject to the requirements of § 1026.18(g). On the other hand, if a closed-end consumer credit transaction is not secured by real property or a dwelling (for example, if it is unsecured or secured by an automobile), the creditor discloses a payment schedule in accordance with § 1026.18(g) and is not subject to the requirements of § 1026.18(s) or §§ 1026.37(c) and 1026.38(c).</content>

    <content>Section 1026.18(s) prescribes format and content for disclosure of interest rates and monthly (or other periodic) payments for reverse mortgages and certain transactions secured by dwellings that are personal property but not cooperative units. The information in § 1026.18(s)(2) through (4) is required to be in the form of a table, except as otherwise provided, with headings and format substantially similar to model clause H-4(E), H-4(F), H-4(G), or H-4(H) in appendix H to this part. A disclosure that does not include the shading shown in a model clause but otherwise follows the model clause's headings and format is substantially similar to that model clause. Where § 1026.18(s)(2) through (4) or the applicable model clause requires that a column or row of the table be labeled using the word “monthly” but the periodic payments are not due monthly, the creditor should use the appropriate term, such as “bi-weekly” or “quarterly.” In all cases, the table should have no more than five vertical columns corresponding to applicable interest rates at various times during the loan's term; corresponding payments would be shown in horizontal rows.

      <title>Good faith requirement for property taxes or non-required services chosen by the consumer.</title>
      <content>Differences between the amounts of estimated charges for property taxes or services not required by the creditor disclosed under § <ref target="1026-19-e-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(1)(i)</ref> and the amounts of such charges paid by or imposed on the consumer do not constitute a lack of good faith, so long as the original estimated charge, or lack of an estimated charge for a particular service, was based on the best information reasonably available to the creditor at the time the disclosure was provided. For example, if the consumer informs the creditor that the consumer will obtain a type of inspection not required by the creditor, the creditor must include the charge for that item in the disclosures provided under § <ref target="1026-19-e-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(1)(i)</ref>, but the actual amount of the inspection fee need not be compared to the original estimate for the inspection fee to perform the good faith analysis required by § <ref target="1026-19-e-3-iii" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(3)(iii)</ref>. The original estimated charge, or lack of an estimated charge for a particular service, complies with § <ref target="1026-19-e-3-iii" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(3)(iii)</ref> if it is made based on the best information reasonably available to the creditor at the time that the estimate was provided. But, for example, if the subject property is located in a jurisdiction where consumers are customarily represented at closing by their own attorney, even though it is not a requirement, and the creditor fails to include a fee for the consumer's attorney, or includes an unreasonably low estimate for such fee, on the original estimates provided under § <ref target="1026-19-e-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(1)(i)</ref>, then the creditor's failure to disclose, or unreasonably low estimation, does not comply with § <ref target="1026-19-e-3-iii" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(3)(iii)</ref>. Similarly, the amount disclosed for property taxes must be based on the best information reasonably available to the creditor at the time the disclosure was provided. For example, if the creditor fails to include a charge for property taxes, or includes an unreasonably low estimate for that charge, on the original estimates provided under § <ref target="1026-19-e-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(1)(i)</ref>, then the creditor's failure to disclose, or unreasonably low estimation, does not comply with § <ref target="1026-19-e-3-iii" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(3)(iii)</ref> and the charge for property tax would be subject to the good faith determination under § <ref target="1026-19-e-3-i" reftype="internal">1026.19(e)(3)(i)</ref>.</content>

      <content>If a creditor chooses to use an average charge for a settlement service for a particular loan within a class, § <ref target="1026-19-f-3-ii-C" reftype="internal">1026.19(f)(3)(ii)(C)</ref> requires the creditor to use that average charge for that service on all loans within the class. For example:</content>
      <interpParagraph label="1026-19-f-3-ii-Interp-3-i" marker="i.">
        <title/>
        <content>Assume a creditor elects to use an average charge for appraisal fees. The creditor defines a class of transactions as all fixed rate loans originated between January 1 and April 30 secured by real property or a cooperative unit located within a particular metropolitan statistical area. The creditor must then charge the average appraisal charge to all consumers obtaining fixed rate loans originated between May 1 and August 30 secured by real property or a cooperative unit located within the same metropolitan statistical area.</content>
      </interpParagraph>
      <interpParagraph label="1026-19-f-3-ii-Interp-3-ii" marker="ii.">
        <content>The example in paragraph i of this comment assumes that a consumer would not be required to pay the average appraisal charge unless an appraisal was required on that particular loan. Using the example above, if a consumer applies for a loan within the defined class, but already has an appraisal report acceptable to the creditor from a prior loan application, the creditor may not charge the consumer the average appraisal fee because an acceptable appraisal report has already been obtained for the consumer's application. Similarly, although the creditor defined the class broadly to include all fixed rate loans, the creditor may not require the consumer to pay the average appraisal charge if the particular fixed rate loan program the consumer applied for does not require an appraisal.</content>

To comply with this requirement, the creditor discloses the value determined by the appraisal or valuation used to determine approval of the credit transaction. If the creditor has not obtained an appraisal, the creditor may disclose the estimated value of the property. Where an estimate is disclosed, rather than an appraisal, the label for the disclosure is changed to “Estimated Prop. Value.” The creditor may use the estimate provided by the consumer at <ref target="1026-2-a-3-i" reftype="term">application</ref> but, if it has performed its own estimate of the property value for purposes of approving the credit transaction by the time the disclosure is provided to the consumer, the creditor must disclose the estimate it used for purposes of approving the credit transaction. For transactions involving construction where there is no seller, the creditor must disclose the value of the property that is used to determine the approval of the credit transaction, including improvements to be made on the property if those improvements are used in determining the approval of the credit transaction.</content>

        <content>Under § <ref target="1026-38-e-2-iii-A" reftype="internal">1026.38(e)(2)(iii)(A)</ref>, calculation of the excess amounts above the limitations on increases in closing costs takes into account that the itemized, estimated closing costs disclosed on the Loan Estimate will not result in charges to the consumer if the service is not actually provided at or before consummation. For example, if the Loan Estimate included under “Services You Cannot Shop For” a $30 charge for a “title courier fee,” but the title company elects to hand-deliver the title documents package to the creditor at no charge, the $30 fee is not factored into the calculation of the “Total Closing Costs” that are subject to the limitations on increases in closing costs. However, if the title courier fee was assessed, but at only $15, the charge is factored into the calculation because the third party service was actually provided, albeit at a lower amount than estimated.

        <content>Under § <ref target="1026-38-i-1-iii-A" reftype="internal">1026.38(i)(1)(iii)(A)</ref>, calculation of the excess amounts above the limitations on increases in closing costs takes into account that the itemized, estimated closing costs disclosed on the Loan Estimate will not result in charges to the consumer if the service is not actually provided at or before consummation. For example, if the Loan Estimate included under “Services You Cannot Shop For” a $30 charge for a “title courier fee,” but the title company elects to hand-deliver the title documents package to the creditor at no charge, the $30 fee is not factored into the calculation of the “Total Closing Costs” that are subject to the limitations on increases in closing costs. However, if the title courier fee was assessed, but at only $15, the charge is factored into the calculation because the third-party service was actually provided, albeit at a lower amount than estimated.</content>

If, for example, a decrease in the seller credits disclosed under § <ref target="1026-38-i-7-ii" reftype="internal">1026.38(i)(7)(ii)</ref> is attributable only to a decrease in general (i.e., lump sum) seller credits, then a statement is given under the subheading “Did this change?” in the calculating cash to close table that the consumer should see the details disclosed under § <ref target="1026-38-j-2-v" reftype="internal">1026.38(j)(2)(v)</ref> in the summaries of transactions table and the seller-paid column of § <ref target="1026-38-f" reftype="internal">1026.38(f)</ref> or (g), or that the consumer should see the details disclosed under § <ref target="1026-38-j-2-v" reftype="internal">1026.38(j)(2)(v)</ref> in the summaries of transactions table. Form H-25(B) in appendix H to this part demonstrates this disclosure where the decrease in seller credits is attributable only to a decrease in general seller credits and the creditor choses only to reference the applicable provision; form H-25(B)'s statement “See Seller Credits in Section L,” in which the words “Section L” are in boldface font, complies with this requirement. Where the decrease in the seller credits disclosed under § <ref target="1026-38-i-7-ii" reftype="internal">1026.38(i)(7)(ii)</ref> is attributable to specific and general seller credits, or the creditor does not elect to reference only the applicable provision, then a statement is given under the subheading “Did this change?” that the consumer should see both the details disclosed under § <ref target="1026-38-j-2-v" reftype="internal">1026.38(j)(2)(v)</ref> in the summaries of transactions table and the seller-paid column of the closing cost details table under § <ref target="1026-38-f" reftype="internal">1026.38(f)</ref> or (g). For example, the statement “See Seller-Paid column on page 2 and Seller Credits in Section L,” in which the words “Seller-Paid” and “Section L” are in boldface font, complies with this requirement.</content>

      <title>Calculation of total of payments.</title>
      <content>The total of payments is the total, expressed as a dollar amount, the consumer will have paid after making all payments of principal, interest, mortgage insurance, and loan costs, as scheduled, through the end of the loan term. The total of payments excludes charges that would otherwise be included as components of the total of payments if such charges are designated on the Closing Disclosure as paid by seller or paid by others. A seller or other party, such as the creditor, may agree to offset payments of principal, interest, mortgage insurance, or loan costs, whether in whole or in part, through a specific credit, for example through a specific seller or lender credit. Because these amounts are not paid by the consumer, they are excluded from the total of payments calculation. Non-specific credits, however, are generalized payments to the consumer that do not pay for a particular fee and therefore do not offset amounts for purposes of the total of payments calculation. For guidance on the amounts included in the total of payments calculation, see the “In 5 Years” disclosure under § <ref target="1026-37-l-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.37(l)(1)(i)</ref> and comment 37(l)(1)(i)-1.
