Additionally, §§ 1026.20(e) and 1026.39(d)(5), as amended or adopted by the TILA-RESPA Final Rule, took effect on October 3, 2015, for transactions for which the creditor or mortgage broker received an application on or after October 3, 2015, and take effect October 1, 2018, with respect to transactions for which a creditor or mortgage broker received an application prior to October 3, 2015.</content>

These provisions include § 1026.19(e)(2)(i), which restricts the fees that may be imposed on a consumer, § 1026.19(e)(2)(ii), which requires a statement to be included on written estimates of terms or costs specific to a consumer, and § 1026.19(e)(2)(iii), which prohibits creditors from requiring the submission of documents verifying information related to the consumer's application.

Section 1026.3(h) exempts transactions from § 1026.19(e) and (f) if the creditor chooses to provide disclosures described in § 1026.18 that comply with this part pursuant to § 1026.3(h)(6)(i), but does not exempt transactions from § 1026.19(e) and (f) if the creditor chooses to provide disclosures described in § 1026.19(e) and (f) that comply with this part pursuant to § 1026.3(h)(6)(ii). Creditors may provide, at their option, either the disclosures described in § 1026.18 or the disclosures described in § 1026.19(e) and (f). In providing these disclosures, creditors must comply with all provisions of this part relating to those disclosures. Section 1026.3(h) does not exempt transactions from any of the other requirements of this part, to the extent they are applicable. For transactions that would otherwise be subject to § 1026.19(e), (f), and (g), creditors must comply with all other applicable requirements of this part, including the consumer's right to rescind the transaction under § 1026.23, to the extent that provision is applicable.</content>

The other requirements of § 1026.3(h) need not be reflected in the loan contract, but the creditor must retain evidence of compliance with those provisions, as required by § 1026.25(a) or (c), as applicable. In particular, because the exemption in § 1026.3(h) means the creditor is not required to provide the disclosures of closing costs under § 1026.37 or § 1026.38 (unless the creditor chooses to provide disclosures described in § 1026.19(e) and (f) that comply with this part), the creditor must retain evidence reflecting that the costs payable by the consumer in connection with the transaction at consummation are limited to recording fees, transfer taxes, a bona fide and reasonable application fee, and a bona fide and reasonable housing counseling fee, and that the total of application and housing counseling fees is less than 1 percent of the amount of credit extended, in accordance with § 1026.3(h)(5). Unless the itemization of the amount financed provided to the consumer sufficiently details this requirement, the creditor must establish compliance with § 1026.3(h)(5) by some other written document and retain it in accordance with § 1026.25(a) or (c), as applicable.</content>

    <change operation="modified" label="1026-17-c-6-Interp-5" subpath="content">
      <content>When a creditor uses the special rule in § 1026.17(c)(6) to disclose credit extensions as multiple transactions, fees and charges must be allocated for purposes of calculating disclosures. In the case of a construction-permanent loan that a creditor chooses to disclose as multiple transactions, the creditor must allocate to the construction transaction finance charges under § 1026.4 and points and fees under § 1026.32(b)(1) that would not be imposed but for the construction financing. For example, inspection and handling fees for the staged disbursement of construction loan proceeds must be included in the disclosures for the construction phase and may not be included in the disclosures for the permanent phase. If a creditor charges separate amounts for finance charges under § 1026.4 and points and fees under § 1026.32(b)(1) for the construction phase and the permanent phase, such amounts must be allocated to the phase for which they are charged. If a creditor charges an origination fee for construction financing only but charges a greater origination fee for construction-permanent financing, the difference between the two fees must be allocated to the permanent phase. All other finance charges under § 1026.4 and points and fees under § 1026.32(b)(1) must be allocated to the permanent financing. Fees and charges that are not used to compute the finance charge under § 1026.4 or points and fees under § 1026.32(b)(1) may be allocated between the transactions in any manner the creditor chooses. For example, a reasonable appraisal fee paid to an independent, third-party appraiser may be allocated in any manner the creditor chooses because it would be excluded from the finance charge pursuant to § 1026.4(c)(7) and excluded from points and fees pursuant to § 1026.32(b)(1)(iii).</content>

      <content>Section 1026.18(g) applies to closed-end transactions, other than transactions that are subject to § 1026.18(s) or § 1026.19(e) and (f). Section 1026.18(s) applies to closed-end transactions secured by real property or a dwelling, unless they are subject to § 1026.19(e) and (f). Section 1026.19(e) and (f) applies to closed-end transactions secured by real property or a cooperative unit, other than reverse mortgages. Thus, if a closed-end consumer credit transaction is secured by real property, a cooperative unit, or a dwelling and the transaction is a reverse mortgage or the dwelling is personal property but not a cooperative unit, then the creditor discloses an interest rate and payment summary table in accordance with § 1026.18(s). See comment 18(s)-4. If a closed-end consumer credit transaction is secured by real property or a cooperative unit and is not a reverse mortgage, the creditor discloses a projected payments table in accordance with §§ 1026.37(c) and 1026.38(c), as required by § 1026.19(e) and (f). In all such cases, the creditor is not subject to the requirements of § 1026.18(g). On the other hand, if a closed-end consumer credit transaction is not secured by real property or a dwelling (for example, if it is unsecured or secured by an automobile), the creditor discloses a payment schedule in accordance with § 1026.18(g) and is not subject to the requirements of § 1026.18(s) or §§ 1026.37(c) and 1026.38(c).</content>

      <content>Section 1026.18(s) prescribes format and content for disclosure of interest rates and monthly (or other periodic) payments for reverse mortgages and certain transactions secured by dwellings that are personal property but not cooperative units. The information in § 1026.18(s)(2) through (4) is required to be in the form of a table, except as otherwise provided, with headings and format substantially similar to model clause H-4(E), H-4(F), H-4(G), or H-4(H) in appendix H to this part. A disclosure that does not include the shading shown in a model clause but otherwise follows the model clause's headings and format is substantially similar to that model clause. Where § 1026.18(s)(2) through (4) or the applicable model clause requires that a column or row of the table be labeled using the word “monthly” but the periodic payments are not due monthly, the creditor should use the appropriate term, such as “bi-weekly” or “quarterly.” In all cases, the table should have no more than five vertical columns corresponding to applicable interest rates at various times during the loan's term; corresponding payments would be shown in horizontal rows. Certain loan types and terms are defined for purposes of § 1026.18(s) in § 1026.18(s)(7).</content>

          <content>Section 1026.19(e)(1)(i) requires early disclosure of credit terms in closed-end credit transactions that are secured by real property or a cooperative unit, other than reverse mortgages. These disclosures must be provided in good faith. Except as otherwise provided in § 1026.19(e), a disclosure is in good faith if it is consistent with § 1026.17(c)(2)(i). Section 1026.17(c)(2)(i) provides that if any information necessary for an accurate disclosure is unknown to the creditor, the creditor shall make the disclosure based on the best information reasonably available to the creditor at the time the disclosure is provided to the consumer. The “reasonably available” standard requires that the creditor, acting in good faith, exercise due diligence in obtaining information. See comment 17(c)(2)(i)-1 for an explanation of the standard set forth in § 1026.17(c)(2)(i). See comment 17(c)(2)(i)-2 for labeling disclosures required under § 1026.19(e) that are estimates.</content>

        <title>Multiple-advance construction loans.</title>
        <content>Section 1026.19(e)(1)(iii) generally requires a creditor to deliver the Loan Estimate or place it in the mail not later than the third business day after the creditor receives the consumer's application and not later than the seventh business day before consummation. When a multiple-advance loan to finance the construction of a dwelling may be permanently financed by the same creditor, § 1026.17(c)(6)(ii) and comment 17(c)(6)-2 permit creditors to treat the construction phase and the permanent phase as either one transaction, with one combined disclosure, or more than one transaction, with a separate disclosure for each transaction. For construction—permanent transactions disclosed as one transaction, the creditor complies with § 1026.19(e)(1)(iii) by delivering or placing in the mail one combined disclosure required by § 1026.19(e)(1)(i) not later than the third business day after the creditor receives an application and not later than the seventh business day before consummation. For construction—permanent transactions disclosed as a separate construction phase and a separate permanent phase for which an application for both the construction and permanent financing has been received, the creditor complies with § 1026.19(e)(1)(iii) by delivering or placing in the mail the separate disclosures required by § 1026.19(e)(1)(i) for both the construction financing and the permanent financing not later than the third business day after the creditor receives the application and not later than the seventh business day before consummation. A creditor may also provide a separate disclosure required by § 1026.19(e)(1)(i) for the permanent phase before receiving an application for permanent financing at any time not later than the seventh business day before consummation.

If the creditor generally conducts separate closings for the construction financing and the permanent financing or expects that the construction financing and the permanent financing may have separate closings, providing separate Loan Estimates for the construction financing and for the permanent financing allows the creditor to deliver separate Closing Disclosures for the separate phases. For example, assume further that the consumer has requested permanent financing after receiving separate Loan Estimates for the construction financing and for the permanent financing, that consummation of the construction financing is scheduled for July 1, and that consummation of the permanent financing is scheduled on or about June 1 of the following year. The creditor may provide the construction financing Closing Disclosure at least three business days before consummation of that transaction on July 1 and delay providing the permanent financing Closing Disclosure until three business days before consummation of that transaction on or about June 1 of the following year, in accordance with § 1026.19(f)(1)(ii).

Differences between the amounts of such charges disclosed under § 1026.19(e)(1)(i) and the amounts of such charges paid by or imposed on the consumer do not constitute a lack of good faith, so long as the original estimated charge, or lack of an estimated charge for a particular service, was based on the best information reasonably available to the creditor at the time the disclosure was provided. For example, if the consumer informs the creditor that the consumer will choose a settlement agent not identified by the creditor on the written list provided under § 1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(C), and the creditor discloses an unreasonably low estimated settlement agent fee of $20 when the average prices for settlement agent fees in that area are $150, then the under-disclosure does not comply with § 1026.19(e)(3)(iii) and good faith is determined under § 1026.19(e)(3)(i). If the creditor permits the consumer to shop consistent with § 1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(A) but fails to provide the written list required under § 1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(C), good faith is determined under § 1026.19(e)(3)(ii) instead of § 1026.19(e)(3)(iii) unless the settlement service provider is the creditor or an affiliate of the creditor in which case good faith is determined under § 1026.19(e)(3)(i). As noted in comment 19(e)(1)(vi)-1 whether the creditor permits the consumer to shop consistent with § 1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(A) is determined based on all the relevant facts and circumstances.</content>

        <title>Good faith requirement for property taxes or non-required services chosen by the consumer.</title>
        <content>Differences between the amounts of estimated charges for property taxes or services not required by the creditor disclosed under § 1026.19(e)(1)(i) and the amounts of such charges paid by or imposed on the consumer do not constitute a lack of good faith, so long as the original estimated charge, or lack of an estimated charge for a particular service, was based on the best information reasonably available to the creditor at the time the disclosure was provided. For example, if the consumer informs the creditor that the consumer will obtain a type of inspection not required by the creditor, the creditor must include the charge for that item in the disclosures provided under § 1026.19(e)(1)(i), but the actual amount of the inspection fee need not be compared to the original estimate for the inspection fee to perform the good faith analysis required by § 1026.19(e)(3)(iii). The original estimated charge, or lack of an estimated charge for a particular service, complies with § 1026.19(e)(3)(iii) if it is made based on the best information reasonably available to the creditor at the time that the estimate was provided. But, for example, if the subject property is located in a jurisdiction where consumers are customarily represented at closing by their own attorney, even though it is not a requirement, and the creditor fails to include a fee for the consumer's attorney, or includes an unreasonably low estimate for such fee, on the original estimates provided under § 1026.19(e)(1)(i), then the creditor's failure to disclose, or unreasonably low estimation, does not comply with § 1026.19(e)(3)(iii). Similarly, the amount disclosed for property taxes must be based on the best information reasonably available to the creditor at the time the disclosure was provided. For example, if the creditor fails to include a charge for property taxes, or includes an unreasonably low estimate for that charge, on the original estimates provided under § 1026.19(e)(1)(i), then the creditor's failure to disclose, or unreasonably low estimation, does not comply with § 1026.19(e)(3)(iii) and the charge for property tax would be subject to the good faith determination under § 1026.19(e)(3)(i).</content>

Section 1026.19(e)(3)(iii) provides that an estimate of the charges listed in § 1026.19(e)(3)(iii) is in good faith if it is consistent with the best information reasonably available to the creditor at the time the disclosure is provided and that good faith is determined under § 1026.19(e)(3)(iii) even if such charges are paid to the creditor or affiliates of the creditor, so long as the charges are bona fide.

For example, if a consumer requests a rate lock extension, then the revised disclosures on which a creditor relies for purposes of determining good faith under § 1026.19(e)(3)(i) may reflect a new rate lock extension fee, but the fee may be no more than the rate lock extension fee charged by the creditor in its usual course of business, and the creditor may not rely on changes to other charges unrelated to the rate lock extension for purposes of determining good faith under § 1026.19(e)(3)(i) and (ii).</content>

Section 1026.19(e)(4)(ii) prohibits a creditor from providing a revised version of the Loan Estimate as required by § 1026.19(e)(1)(i) on or after the date on which the creditor provides the Closing Disclosure as required by § 1026.19(f)(1)(i).

For example, if the creditor requires the consumer to pay money into a reserve account for the future payment of taxes, the creditor must disclose to the consumer the exact amount that the consumer is required to pay into the reserve account.

          <title>Estimated property value.</title>
          <content>In transactions where there is no seller, such as in a refinancing, § 1026.37(a)(7)(ii) requires the creditor to disclose the estimated value of the property identified in § 1026.37(a)(6) based on the best information reasonably available to the creditor at the time the disclosure is provided to the consumer, which may include, at the creditor's option, the estimated value of the improvements to be made on the property in transactions involving construction. The creditor may use the estimate provided by the consumer at application unless it has performed its own estimate of the property value by the time the disclosure is provided to the consumer, in which case the creditor must use its own estimate. If the creditor has obtained any appraisals or valuations of the property for the application at the time the disclosure is issued to the consumer, the value determined by the appraisal or valuation to be used during underwriting for the application is disclosed as the estimated property value. If the creditor has obtained multiple appraisals or valuations and has not yet determined which one will be used during underwriting, it may disclose the value from any appraisal or valuation it reasonably believes it may use in underwriting the transaction. In a transaction that involves a seller, if the sale price is not yet known, the creditor complies with § 1026.37(a)(7) if it discloses the estimated value of the property that it used as the basis for the disclosures in the Loan Estimate.</content>

Where personal property is included in the sale price of the real property or cooperative unit (for example, if the consumer is purchasing the furniture inside the dwelling), however, § 1026.37(a)(7) permits disclosure of the aggregate price without any reduction for the appraised or estimated value of the personal property.</content>

        <title>General.</title>
        <content>Section 1026.37(a)(9) requires disclosure of the consumer's intended use of the credit. In ascertaining the consumer's intended use, § 1026.37(a)(9) requires the creditor to consider all relevant information known to the creditor at the time of the disclosure. If the purpose is not known, the creditor may rely on the consumer's stated purpose. The following examples illustrate when each of the permissible purposes should be disclosed:</content>
        <interpParagraph label="1026-37-a-9-Interp-1-i" marker="i.">
          <title>Purchase.</title>
          <content>The consumer intends to use the proceeds from the transaction to purchase the property that will secure the extension of credit. In a purchase transaction with simultaneous subordinate financing, the simultaneous subordinate loan is also disclosed with the purpose “Purchase.”</content>

        <interpParagraph label="1026-37-a-9-Interp-1-ii" marker="ii.">
          <title>Refinance.</title>
          <content>The consumer refinances an existing obligation already secured by the consumer's dwelling to change the rate, term, or other loan features and may or may not receive cash from the transaction. For example, in a refinance with no cash provided, the new amount financed does not exceed the unpaid principal balance, any earned unpaid finance charge on the existing debt, and amounts attributed solely to the costs of the refinancing. Conversely, in a refinance with cash provided, the consumer refinances an existing mortgage obligation and receives money from the transaction that is in addition to the funds used to pay the unpaid principal balance, any earned unpaid finance charge on the existing debt, and amounts attributed solely to the costs of the refinancing. In such a transaction, the consumer may, for example, use the newly-extended credit to pay off the balance of the existing mortgage and other consumer debt, such as a credit card balance.</content>

          <title>Construction.</title>
          <content>Section 1026.37(a)(9)(iii) requires the creditor to disclose that the loan is for construction in transactions where the creditor extends credit to finance only the cost of initial construction (construction-only loan), not renovations to existing dwellings, and in transactions where a multiple advance loan may be permanently financed by the same creditor (construction-permanent loan). In a construction-only loan, the borrower may be required to make interest-only payments during the loan term with the balance commonly due at the end of the construction project. For additional guidance on disclosing construction-permanent loans, see § 1026.17(c)(6)(ii), comments 17(c)(6)-2, -3, and -5, and appendix D to this part.</content>

        <title>Additional features.</title>
        <content>When disclosing a loan product with at least one of the features described in § 1026.37(a)(10)(ii), § 1026.37(a)(10)(iii) and (iv) require the disclosure of only the first applicable feature in the order of § 1026.37(a)(10)(ii) and that it be preceded by the time period or the length of the introductory period and the frequency of the first adjustment period, as applicable, followed by a description of the loan product and its time period as provided for in § 1026.37(a)(10)(i). For example:</content>
        <interpParagraph label="1026-37-a-13-Interp-2-i" marker="i.">
          <title>Negative amortization.</title>
          <content>Some loan products, such as “payment option” loans, permit the borrower to make payments that are insufficient to cover all of the interest accrued, and the unpaid interest is added to the principal balance. Where the loan product includes a loan feature that may cause the loan balance to increase, the disclosure required by § 1026.37(a)(10)(ii)(A) is preceded by the time period that the borrower is permitted to make payments that result in negative amortization (e.g., “2 Year Negative Amortization”), followed by the loan product type. Thus, a fixed rate product with a step-payment feature for the first two years of the legal obligation that may negatively amortize is disclosed as “2 Year Negative Amortization, Fixed Rate.”</content>
        </interpParagraph>
        <interpParagraph label="1026-37-a-13-Interp-2-ii" marker="ii.">
          <title>Interest only.</title>
          <content>When disclosing an “Interest Only” feature, as defined in § 1026.18(s)(7)(iv), the applicable time period must precede the label “Interest Only.” Thus, a fixed rate loan with only interest due for the first five years of the loan term is disclosed as “5 Year Interest Only, Fixed Rate.” If the interest only feature fails to cover the total interest due, then, as required by § 1026.37(a)(10)(iii), the disclosure must reference the negative amortization feature and not the interest only feature (e.g., “5 Year Negative Amortization, Fixed Rate”). See comment app. D-7.ii for an explanation of the disclosure of the time period of an interest only feature for a construction loan or a construction-permanent loan.</content>
        </interpParagraph>
        <interpParagraph label="1026-37-a-13-Interp-2-iii" marker="iii.">
          <title>Step payment.</title>
          <content>When disclosing a step payment feature (which is sometimes referred to instead as a graduated payment), the period of time at the end of which the scheduled payments will change must precede the label “Step Payment” (e.g., “5 Year Step Payment”) followed by the name of the loan product. Thus, a fixed rate mortgage subject to a 5-year step payment plan is disclosed as a “5 Year Step Payment, Fixed Rate.”</content>

        <interpParagraph label="1026-37-a-13-Interp-2-iv" marker="iv.">
          <title>Ballon payment.</title>
          <content>If a loan product includes a “balloon payment,” as that term is defined in § 1026.37(b)(5), the disclosure of the balloon payment feature, including the year the payment is due, precedes the disclosure of the loan product. Thus, if the loan product is a step rate with an introductory rate that lasts for three years and adjusts each year thereafter until the balloon payment is due in the seventh year of the loan term, the disclosure required is “Year 7 Balloon Payment, 3/1 Step Rate.” If the loan product includes more than one balloon payment, only the earliest year that a balloon payment is due shall be disclosed.</content>

          <content>If a loan product includes a seasonal payment feature, § 1026.37(a)(10)(ii)(E) requires that the creditor disclose the feature. The feature is not, however, required to be disclosed with any preceding time period. Disclosure of the label “Seasonal Payment” without any preceding number of years satisfies this requirement.</content>

If the consumer fails to indicate an intent to proceed with the transaction within 10 business days after the disclosures were originally provided under § 1026.19(e)(1)(iii) (or within any longer time period established by the creditor), then, for determining good faith under § 1026.19(e)(3)(i) and (ii), a creditor may use a revised estimate of a charge instead of the amount originally disclosed under § 1026.19(e)(1)(i).

Although § 1026.37(b)(2) refers to the index plus margin “at consummation,” if the index value that will be in effect at consummation is unknown at the time the disclosures are provided under § 1026.19(e)(1)(iii), i.e., within three business days after receipt of a consumer's application, the fully-indexed rate disclosed under § 1026.37(b)(2) may be based on the index in effect at the time the disclosure is delivered. The index in effect at consummation (or the time the disclosure is delivered under § 1026.19(e)) need not be used if the contract provides for a delay in the implementation of changes in an index value. For example, if the contract specifies that rate changes are based on the index value in effect 45 days before the change date, creditors may use any index value in effect during the 45 days before consummation (or any earlier date of disclosure) in calculating the fully-indexed rate to be disclosed.

        <content>On the Loan Estimate for simultaneous subordinate financing purchase transactions, the sale price disclosed under § 1026.37(a)(7)(i) is not used under § 1026.37(h)(1) for the calculating cash to close table calculations that include the sale price as a component of the calculation. For example, sale price is generally included in the closing costs financed calculation under § 1026.37(h)(1)(ii) as a component of the estimated total amount of payments to third parties. However, for simultaneous subordinate financing transactions, the estimated total amount of payments to third parties would not include the sale price. The estimated total amount of payments to third parties only includes payments occurring in the simultaneous subordinate financing transaction other than payments toward the sale price.</content>

Section 1026.37(h)(1)(iii)(B) requires that, for all non-purchase transactions, the amount of estimated funds from the consumer is determined in accordance with § 1026.37(h)(1)(v). Pursuant to § 1026.37(h)(1)(v), the amount to be disclosed under § 1026.37(h)(1)(iii)(A)(2) or (B) is determined by subtracting the sum of the loan amount disclosed under § 1026.37(b)(1) and any amount of existing loans assumed or taken subject to that will be disclosed under § 1026.38(j)(2)(iv) (excluding any closing costs financed disclosed under § 1026.37(h)(1)(ii)) from the total amount of all existing debt being satisfied in the transaction. The total amount of all existing debt being satisfied in the transaction is the sum of the amounts that will be disclosed on the Closing Disclosure in the summaries of transactions table under § 1026.38(j)(1)(ii), (iii), and (v), as applicable. When the result of the calculation is positive, that amount is disclosed under § 1026.37(h)(1)(iii) as “Down Payment/Funds from Borrower,” and $0 is disclosed under § 1026.37(h)(1)(v) as “Funds for Borrower.” When the result of the calculation is negative, that amount is disclosed as a negative number under § 1026.37(h)(1)(v) as “Funds for Borrower,” and $0 is disclosed under § 1026.37(h)(1)(iii) as “Down Payment/Funds from Borrower.” When the result is $0, $0 is disclosed as “Down Payment/Funds from Borrower” and “Funds for Borrower” under § 1026.37(h)(1)(iii) and (v), respectively.</content>

If a creditor is required to disclose the name of the party making the payment or that the principal reduction is being provided to offset charges that exceed the legal limits, and there is insufficient space under the § 1026.38(j)(1)(v) or (t)(5)(vii)(B) disclosure for these elements of the principal reduction disclosure, the creditor may omit these elements from the § 1026.38(j)(1)(v) or (t)(5)(vii)(B) disclosure. If the creditor omits these elements from the § 1026.38(j)(1)(v) or (t)(5)(vii)(B) disclosure, the creditor must provide a complete principal reduction disclosure under an appropriate heading on an additional page, in accordance with § 1026.38(j) and (t)(5)(ix), as applicable, with a reference to the abbreviated principal reduction disclosure under § 1026.38(j)(1)(v) or (t)(5)(vii)(B).</content>

          <content>A principal reduction is disclosed in the summaries of transactions table under § 1026.38(j)(1)(v) and marked with the phrase “Paid Outside of Closing” or the abbreviation “P.O.C.” pursuant to § 1026.38(j)(4)(i), or in the payoffs and payments table under § 1026.38(t)(5)(vii)(B) marked with the phrase “Paid Outside of Closing” or the abbreviation “P.O.C.,” if it is not paid from closing funds. For a principal reduction disclosed under § 1026.38(j)(1)(v) that is not paid from closing funds, the amount of the principal reduction is not included in computing the summaries of transactions totals under § 1026.38(j) or the cash to close disclosures under § 1026.38(i). For a principal reduction disclosed under § 1026.38(t)(5)(vii)(B) that is not paid from closing funds, the amount of the principal reduction is not included in computing the total payoffs and payments amount disclosed under § 1026.38(t)(5)(vii)(B) or the cash to close amount disclosed under § 1026.38(e)(5)(ii). For example, a creditor providing a $500 principal reduction to satisfy the refund requirements of § 1026.19(f)(2)(v) discloses the principal reduction under § 1026.38(j)(1)(v) by providing in Section K of the summaries of transactions table a statement such as “$500.00 Principal Reduction for exceeding legal limits P.O.C. Lender,” and not including the amount of the principal reduction in the summaries of transactions totals under § 1026.38(j) or the calculating cash to close disclosures under § 1026.38(i). Alternatively, if there is insufficient space under § 1026.38(j)(1)(v) for a creditor to disclose the name of the party making the payment or a statement that the principal reduction is being provided to offset charges that exceed the legal limits, a creditor may disclose a statement such as “$500.00 Principal Reduction P.O.C.” under § 1026.38(j)(1)(v) and a statement on an additional page such as “$500.00 Principal Reduction for exceeding legal limits P.O.C.

          <title>Principal reduction paid with closing funds.</title>
          <content>A principal reduction is disclosed in the summaries of transactions table under § 1026.38(j)(1)(v) or in the payoffs and payments table under § 1026.38(t)(5)(vii)(B) without the phrase “Paid Outside of Closing” or the abbreviation “P.O.C.” if it is paid from closing funds. The amount of a principal reduction that is paid with closing funds is included in the applicable calculations required under § 1026.38. For example, in a refinance transaction using the alternative tables on the Closing Disclosure, a creditor discloses a $1,000 principal reduction to reduce the cash provided to the consumer by providing in the payoffs and payments table under § 1026.38(t)(5)(vii)(B) a statement such as “Principal Reduction to Consumer” under the column heading “TO” and “$1,000.00” under the column heading “AMOUNT,” and by including such amount in the total payoffs and payments amount under § 1026.38(t)(5)(vii)(B) and in the cash to close amount under § 1026.38(e)(5)(ii). In this example, the creditor must disclose the following elements under § 1026.38(t)(5)(vii)(B): The amount of the principal reduction, the phrase “principal reduction” or a similar phrase, and the name of the payee. The creditor should not include in the disclosure the phrase “Paid Outside of Closing” or “P.O.C.” and the name of the party making the payment, or a statement that the principal reduction is being provided to offset charges that exceed the legal limits, because those principal reduction disclosure elements are not applicable to the transaction in this particular example. The creditor may not use an addendum for the principal reduction disclosure in this example.</content>

        <title>No seller.</title>
        <content>In transactions where there is no seller, such as in a refinancing, § 1026.38(a)(3)(vii)(B) requires the creditor to disclose the appraised value of the property. To comply with this requirement, the creditor discloses the value determined by the appraisal or valuation used to determine approval of the credit transaction. If the creditor has not obtained an appraisal, the creditor may disclose the estimated value of the property. Where an estimate is disclosed, rather than an appraisal, the label for the disclosure is changed to “Estimated Prop. Value.” The creditor may use the estimate provided by the consumer at application but, if it has performed its own estimate of the property value for purposes of approving the credit transaction by the time the disclosure is provided to the consumer, the creditor must disclose the estimate it used for purposes of approving the credit transaction. For transactions involving construction where there is no seller, the creditor must disclose the value of the property that is used to determine the approval of the credit transaction, including improvements to be made on the property if those improvements are used in determining the approval of the credit transaction.</content>

Any amount in the “Final” column of the alternative calculating cash to close table under § 1026.38(e) is shown to two decimal places unless otherwise required. Pursuant to § 1026.38(t)(4)(i)(C), however, any amount in the “Loan Estimate” column of the alternative calculating cash to close table under § 1026.38(e) is rounded to the nearest dollar amount to match the corresponding estimated amount disclosed on the Loan Estimate's calculating cash to close table under § 1026.37(h).

          <content>Because certain closing costs, individually, are generally subject to the limitations on increases in closing costs under § 1026.19(e)(3)(i) (e.g., fees paid to the creditor, transfer taxes, fees paid to an affiliate of the creditor), while other closing costs are collectively subject to the limitations on increases in closing costs under § 1026.19(e)(3)(ii) (e.g., recording fees, fees paid to an unaffiliated third party identified by the creditor if the creditor permitted the consumer to shop for the service provider), § 1026.38(e)(2)(iii)(A) requires the creditor or closing agent to calculate subtotals for each type of excess amount, and then add such subtotals together to yield the dollar amount to be disclosed in the table. See commentary to § 1026.19(e)(3) for additional guidance on calculating excess amounts above the limitations on increases in closing costs under § 1026.19(e)(3).</content>

          <content>Under § 1026.38(e)(2)(iii)(A), calculation of the excess amounts above the limitations on increases in closing costs takes into account that the itemized, estimated closing costs disclosed on the Loan Estimate will not result in charges to the consumer if the service is not actually provided at or before consummation. For example, if the Loan Estimate included under “Services You Cannot Shop For” a $30 charge for a “title courier fee,” but the title company elects to hand-deliver the title documents package to the creditor at no charge, the $30 fee is not factored into the calculation of the “Total Closing Costs” that are subject to the limitations on increases in closing costs. However, if the title courier fee was assessed, but at only $15, the charge is factored into the calculation because the third party service was actually provided, albeit at a lower amount than estimated. For an example, see form H-25 of appendix H to this part.</content>

          <content>Under § 1026.38(e)(2)(iii)(A), calculation of the excess amounts above the limitations on increases in closing costs takes into account that certain itemized charges listed on the Loan Estimate under the subheading “Services You Can Shop For” may be subject to different limitations depending on the circumstances. Although § 1026.19(e)(3)(iii) provides exceptions to the general rule, such a charge would generally be subject to the limitations under § 1026.19(e)(3)(i) if the consumer decided to use a provider affiliated with the creditor. However, the same charge would instead be subject to the limitations under § 1026.19(e)(3)(ii) if the consumer selected a third party service provider unaffiliated with but identified by the creditor, and the creditor permitted the consumer to shop for the service provider.

          <content>Because certain closing costs, individually, are generally subject to the limitations on increases in closing costs under § 1026.19(e)(3)(i) (e.g., fees paid to the creditor, transfer taxes, fees paid to an affiliate of the creditor), while other closing costs are collectively subject to the limitations on increases in closing costs under § 1026.19(e)(3)(ii) (e.g., recording fees, fees paid to an unaffiliated third party identified by the creditor if the creditor permitted the consumer to shop for the service provider), § 1026.38(i)(1)(iii)(A) requires the creditor or closing agent to calculate subtotals for each type of excess amount, and then add such subtotals together to yield the dollar amount to be disclosed in the table. See commentary to § 1026.19(e)(3) for additional guidance on calculating excess amounts above the limitations on increases in closing costs under § 1026.19(e)(3).</content>

          <content>Under § 1026.38(i)(1)(iii)(A), calculation of the excess amounts above the limitations on increases in closing costs takes into account that the itemized, estimated closing costs disclosed on the Loan Estimate will not result in charges to the consumer if the service is not actually provided at or before consummation. For example, if the Loan Estimate included under “Services You Cannot Shop For” a $30 charge for a “title courier fee,” but the title company elects to hand-deliver the title documents package to the creditor at no charge, the $30 fee is not factored into the calculation of the “Total Closing Costs” that are subject to the limitations on increases in closing costs. However, if the title courier fee was assessed, but at only $15, the charge is factored into the calculation because the third-party service was actually provided, albeit at a lower amount than estimated.</content>

          <content>Under § 1026.38(i)(1)(iii)(A), calculation of the excess amounts above the limitations on increases in closing costs takes into account that certain itemized charges listed on the Loan Estimate under the subheading “Services You Can Shop For” may be subject to different limitations depending on the circumstances. Although § 1026.19(e)(3)(iii) provides exceptions to the general rule, such a charge would generally be subject to the limitations under § 1026.19(e)(3)(i) if the consumer decided to use a provider affiliated with the creditor. However, the same charge would instead be subject to the limitations under § 1026.19(e)(3)(ii) if the consumer selected a third-party service provider unaffiliated with but identified by the creditor, and the creditor permitted the consumer to shop for the service provider.

          <content>Under § 1026.38(i)(4)(ii)(A)(1), the down payment and funds from borrower amount is calculated as the difference between the sale price of the property disclosed under § 1026.38(a)(3)(vii)(A) and the sum of the loan amount disclosed under § 1026.38(b) and any amount of existing loans assumed or taken subject to that is disclosed under § 1026.38(j)(2)(iv), except as required by § 1026.38(i)(4)(ii)(A)(2). The calculation is independent of any loan program or investor requirements. The “Final” amount disclosed for “Down Payment/Funds from Borrower” reflects any change, following delivery of the Loan Estimate, in the amount of down payment and other funds required of the consumer.

          <content>Section 1026.38(i)(4)(ii)(A)(2) requires that, in a purchase transaction as defined in § 1026.37(a)(9)(i) that is a simultaneous subordinate financing transaction or that involves improvements to be made on the property, or when the sum of the loan amount disclosed under § 1026.38(b) and any amount of existing loans assumed or taken subject to that is disclosed under § 1026.38(j)(2)(iv) exceeds the sale price disclosed under § 1026.38(a)(3)(vii)(A), the amount of funds from the consumer is determined in accordance with § 1026.38(i)(6)(iv). Pursuant to § 1026.38(i)(6)(iv), the “Final” amount of “Down Payment/Funds from Borrower” to be disclosed under § 1026.38(i)(4)(ii)(A)(2) is determined by subtracting the sum of the loan amount and any amount of existing loans assumed or taken subject to that is disclosed under § 1026.38(j)(2)(iv) (excluding any closing costs financed disclosed under § 1026.38(i)(3)(ii)) from the total amount of all existing debt being satisfied in the transaction disclosed under § 1026.38(j)(1)(ii), (iii), and (v). The amount of “Down Payment/Funds from Borrower” under the subheading “Final” is disclosed either as a positive number or $0, depending on the result of the calculation. When the result of the calculation is positive, that amount is disclosed under § 1026.38(i)(4)(ii)(A)(2) as “Down Payment/Funds from Borrower,” and $0 is disclosed under § 1026.38(i)(6)(ii) as “Funds for Borrower.” When the result of the calculation is negative, that amount is disclosed under § 1026.38(i)(6)(ii) as “Funds for Borrower,” and $0 is disclosed under § 1026.38(i)(4)(ii)(A)(2) as “Down Payment/Funds from Borrower.” When the result is $0, $0 is disclosed as “Down Payment/Funds from Borrower” and “Funds for Borrower” under § 1026.38(i)(4)(ii)(A)(2) and (6)(ii), respectively. An increase in the amount of “Down Payment/Funds from Borrower” under the subheading “Final” relative to the corresponding amount under the subheading “Loan Estimate” might result, for example, from a decrease in the loan amount or an increase in the amount of existing debt being satisfied in the transaction.

Pursuant to § 1026.38(i)(6)(iv), the “Final” amount of “Down Payment/Funds from Borrower” to be disclosed under § 1026.38(i)(4)(ii)(B) is determined by subtracting the sum of the loan amount disclosed under § 1026.38(b) and any amount of existing loans assumed or taken subject to that is disclosed under § 1026.38(j)(2)(iv) (excluding any closing costs financed disclosed under § 1026.38(i)(3)(ii)) from the total amount of all existing debt being satisfied in the transaction disclosed under § 1026.38(j)(1)(ii), (iii), and (v). The “Final” amount of “Down Payment/Funds from Borrower” is disclosed either as a positive number or $0, depending on the result of the calculation.

See details in Section K,” with the words “increased” and “Section K” in boldface, complies with this requirement. In a purchase or refinancing transaction, in the event the amount of the credit extended by the creditor has decreased and therefore caused the “Down Payment/Funds from Borrower” amount to increase, the statement can read, for example, “You increased this payment.

Section 1026.38(l)(7)(i)(A)(1) requires a disclosure, labeled “Escrowed Property Costs over Year 1,” calculated as the amount disclosed under § 1026.38(l)(7)(i)(A)(4) multiplied by the number of periodic payments scheduled to be made to the escrow account during the first year after consummation. For example, creditors may base such disclosures on less than 12 payments if, based on the payment schedule dictated by the legal obligation, fewer than 12 periodic payments will be made to the escrow account during the first year after consummation. Alternatively, § 1026.38(l)(7)(i)(A)(5) permits the creditor to base the disclosures required by § 1026.38(l)(7)(i)(A)(1) and (4) on amounts derived from the escrow account analysis required under Regulation X, 12 CFR 1024.17, even if those disclosures differ from what would otherwise be disclosed under § 1026.38(l)(7)(i)(A)(1) and (4)—as, for example, when there are fewer than 12 periodic payments scheduled to be made to the escrow account during the first year after consummation.</content>

        <title>Calculation of total of payments.</title>
        <content>The total of payments is the total, expressed as a dollar amount, the consumer will have paid after making all payments of principal, interest, mortgage insurance, and loan costs, as scheduled, through the end of the loan term. The total of payments excludes charges that would otherwise be included as components of the total of payments if such charges are designated on the Closing Disclosure as paid by seller or paid by others. A seller or other party, such as the creditor, may agree to offset payments of principal, interest, mortgage insurance, or loan costs, whether in whole or in part, through a specific credit, for example through a specific seller or lender credit. Because these amounts are not paid by the consumer, they are excluded from the total of payments calculation. Non-specific credits, however, are generalized payments to the consumer that do not pay for a particular fee and therefore do not offset amounts for purposes of the total of payments calculation. For guidance on the amounts included in the total of payments calculation, see the “In 5 Years” disclosure under § 1026.37(l)(1)(i) and comment 37(l)(1)(i)-1. For a discussion of lender credits, see comment 19(e)(3)(i)-5. For a discussion of seller credits, see comment 38(j)(2)(v)-1.</content>

Such a creditor discloses “YES” as the answer to “Can this amount increase after closing?” pursuant to § 1026.37(b)(6), because the initial periodic payment may increase based upon an increase in the interest rate in addition to a change based on the total amount advanced. Such a creditor also discloses a reference to the adjustable payment table required by § 1026.37(i), disclosed as provided in comment app. D-7.iv.B, because that disclosure reflects both a change due to a change in the total amount advanced, which is a change to the periodic principal and interest payment that is not based on an adjustment to the interest rate, as well as the fact that there are interest-only payments.

          <content>A creditor must disclose a projected payments table for certain transactions secured by real property or a cooperative unit, pursuant to §§ 1026.37(c) and 1026.38(c), instead of the general payment schedule required by § 1026.18(g) or the interest rate and payments summary table required by § 1026.18(s). Accordingly, some home construction loans that are secured by real property or a cooperative unit are subject to §§ 1026.37(c) and 1026.38(c) and not § 1026.18(g). See comment app. D-6 for a discussion of transactions that are subject to § 1026.18(s). Under § 1026.17(c)(6)(ii), when a multiple-advance construction loan may be permanently financed by the same creditor, the construction phase and the permanent phase may be treated as either one transaction or more than one transaction. The following are illustrations of the application of appendix D to transactions subject to §§ 1026.37(c) and 1026.38(c), under each of the § 1026.17(c)(6)(ii) alternatives:</content>
          <paragraph label="1026-D-Interp-7-v-A" marker="A.">
            <content>If a creditor uses appendix D and elects pursuant to § 1026.17(c)(6)(ii) to disclose the construction and permanent phases as separate transactions, the construction phase must be disclosed according to the rules in §§ 1026.37(c) and 1026.38(c). Under §§ 1026.37(c) and 1026.38(c), the creditor must disclose the periodic payments during the construction phase in a projected payments table. The provision in appendix D, part I.A.3, which allows the creditor to omit the number and amounts of any interest payments “in disclosing the payment schedule under § 1026.18(g)” does not apply because the transaction is governed by §§ 1026.37(c) and 1026.38(c) rather than § 1026.18(g). If interest is payable only on the amount actually advanced for the time it is outstanding, the creditor determines the amount of the interest-only payment to be made during the construction phase using the assumptions in appendix D, part I.A.1. Also, because the construction phase is being disclosed as a separate transaction and its periodic payments do not repay the principal, the creditor must disclose the construction phase transaction as a product with a balloon payment feature, pursuant to §§ 1026.37(a)(10)(ii)(D) and 1026.38(a)(5)(iii), unless the transaction has negative amortization, interest-only, or step payment features, consistent with the requirement at § 1026.37(a)(10)(iii). In addition, the creditor must provide the balloon payment disclosures pursuant to §§ 1026.37(b)(5), 1026.37(b)(7)(ii), and 1026.38(b) and disclose the balloon payment in the projected payments table.</content>

The first column also reflects the amortizing payments, and mortgage insurance and escrow payments, if any, for the permanent phase if the term of the construction phase is not a full year. The following column(s) reflect the payments for the permanent phase.

If the first column of the projected payments table exclusively discloses the construction phase, the creditor discloses “0” in the first column of the projected payments table for mortgage insurance and a hyphen or dash in the first column of the projected payments table for escrow.

Comment 37(f)(6)-3 explains how to disclose inspection and handling fees that will be collected after consummation in an addendum. Under comment 38(f)-2, the same explanation applies to an addendum used for disclosing such fees in the Closing Disclosure. Comment 37(l)(1)-1 explains that the amount disclosed under § 1026.37(l)(1)(i) is the sum of principal, interest, mortgage insurance, and loan costs scheduled to be paid through the end of the 60th month after the due date of the first periodic payment, and that loan costs are those costs disclosed under § 1026.37(f). Construction loan inspection and handling fees are loan costs that must be included in the sum of the “In 5 Years” disclosure under § 1026.37(l)(1) and the “Total of Payments” disclosure under § 1026.38(o)(1) because they are disclosed under § 1026.37(f), even when they are disclosed on an addendum.</content>
