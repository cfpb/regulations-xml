    <content>When a creditor uses the special rule in § 1026.17(c)(6) to disclose credit extensions as multiple transactions, fees and charges must be allocated for purposes of calculating disclosures. In the case of a construction-permanent loan that a creditor chooses to disclose as multiple transactions, the creditor must allocate to the construction transaction finance charges under § 1026.4 and points and fees under § 1026.32(b)(1) that would not be imposed but for the construction financing. For example, inspection and handling fees for the staged disbursement of construction loan proceeds must be included in the disclosures for the construction phase and may not be included in the disclosures for the permanent phase. If a creditor charges separate amounts for finance charges under § 1026.4 and points and fees under § 1026.32(b)(1) for the construction phase and the permanent phase, such amounts must be allocated to the phase for which they are charged. If a creditor charges an origination fee for construction financing only but charges a greater origination fee for construction-permanent financing, the difference between the two fees must be allocated to the permanent phase. All other finance charges under § 1026.4 and points and fees under § 1026.32(b)(1) must be allocated to the permanent financing. Fees and charges that are not used to compute the finance charge under § 1026.4 or points and fees under § 1026.32(b)(1) may be allocated between the transactions in any manner the creditor chooses. For example, a reasonable appraisal fee paid to an independent, third-party appraiser may be allocated in any manner the creditor chooses because it would be excluded from the finance charge pursuant to § 1026.4(c)(7) and excluded from points and fees pursuant to § 1026.32(b)(1)(iii).</content>

    <content>Section 1026.18(g) applies to closed-end transactions, other than transactions that are subject to § 1026.18(s) or § 1026.19(e) and (f). Section 1026.18(s) applies to closed-end transactions secured by real property or a dwelling, unless they are subject to § 1026.19(e) and (f). Section 1026.19(e) and (f) applies to closed-end transactions secured by real property or a cooperative unit, other than reverse mortgages. Thus, if a closed-end consumer credit transaction is secured by real property, a cooperative unit, or a dwelling and the transaction is a reverse mortgage or the dwelling is personal property but not a cooperative unit, then the creditor discloses an interest rate and payment summary table in accordance with § 1026.18(s). See comment 18(s)-4. If a closed-end consumer credit transaction is secured by real property or a cooperative unit and is not a reverse mortgage, the creditor discloses a projected payments table in accordance with §§ 1026.37(c) and 1026.38(c), as required by § 1026.19(e) and (f). In all such cases, the creditor is not subject to the requirements of § 1026.18(g). On the other hand, if a closed-end consumer credit transaction is not secured by real property or a dwelling (for example, if it is unsecured or secured by an automobile), the creditor discloses a payment schedule in accordance with § 1026.18(g) and is not subject to the requirements of § 1026.18(s) or §§ 1026.37(c) and 1026.38(c).</content>

    <content>Section 1026.18(s) prescribes format and content for disclosure of interest rates and monthly (or other periodic) payments for reverse mortgages and certain transactions secured by dwellings that are personal property but not cooperative units. The information in § 1026.18(s)(2) through (4) is required to be in the form of a table, except as otherwise provided, with headings and format substantially similar to model clause H-4(E), H-4(F), H-4(G), or H-4(H) in appendix H to this part. A disclosure that does not include the shading shown in a model clause but otherwise follows the model clause's headings and format is substantially similar to that model clause. Where § 1026.18(s)(2) through (4) or the applicable model clause requires that a column or row of the table be labeled using the word “monthly” but the periodic payments are not due monthly, the creditor should use the appropriate term, such as “bi-weekly” or “quarterly.” In all cases, the table should have no more than five vertical columns corresponding to applicable interest rates at various times during the loan's term; corresponding payments would be shown in horizontal rows. Certain loan types and terms are defined for purposes of § 1026.18(s) in § 1026.18(s)(7).</content>

        <content>The example in paragraph i of this comment assumes that a consumer would not be required to pay the average appraisal charge unless an appraisal was required on that particular loan. Using the example above, if a consumer applies for a loan within the defined class, but already has an appraisal report acceptable to the creditor from a prior loan application, the creditor may not charge the consumer the average appraisal fee because an acceptable appraisal report has already been obtained for the consumer's application. Similarly, although the creditor defined the class broadly to include all fixed rate loans, the creditor may not require the consumer to pay the average appraisal charge if the particular fixed rate loan program the consumer applied for does not require an appraisal.</content>

      <content>Section <ref target="1026-37-a-9" reftype="internal">1026.37(a)(9)</ref> requires disclosure of the consumer's intended use of the credit. In ascertaining the consumer's intended use, § <ref target="1026-37-a-9" reftype="internal">1026.37(a)(9)</ref> requires the creditor to consider all relevant information known to the creditor at the time of the disclosure. If the purpose is not known, the creditor may rely on the consumer's stated purpose. The following examples illustrate when each of the permissible purposes should be disclosed:</content>
      <interpParagraph label="1026-37-a-9-Interp-1-i" marker="i.">
        <title>Purchase.</title>
        <content>The consumer intends to use the proceeds from the transaction to purchase the property that will secure the extension of credit. In a purchase transaction with simultaneous subordinate financing, the simultaneous subordinate loan is also disclosed with the purpose “Purchase.”</content>
      </interpParagraph>
      <interpParagraph label="1026-37-a-9-Interp-1-ii" marker="ii.">
        <title>Refinance.</title>
        <content>The consumer refinances an existing obligation already secured by the consumer's dwelling to change the rate, term, or other loan features and may or may not receive cash from the transaction. For example, in a refinance with no cash provided, the new amount financed does not exceed the unpaid principal balance, any earned unpaid finance charge on the existing debt, and amounts attributed solely to the costs of the refinancing. Conversely, in a refinance with cash provided, the consumer refinances an existing mortgage obligation and receives money from the transaction that is in addition to the funds used to pay the unpaid principal balance, any earned unpaid finance charge on the existing debt, and amounts attributed solely to the costs of the refinancing. In such a transaction, the consumer may, for example, use the newly-extended credit to pay off the balance of the existing mortgage and other consumer debt, such as a credit card balance.</content>

        <content>Section <ref target="1026-37-a-9-iii" reftype="internal">1026.37(a)(9)(iii)</ref> requires the creditor to disclose that the loan is for construction in transactions where the creditor extends credit to finance only the cost of initial construction (construction-only loan), not renovations to existing dwellings, and in transactions where a multiple advance loan may be permanently financed by the same creditor (construction-permanent loan). In a construction-only loan, the borrower may be required to make interest-only payments during the loan term with the balance commonly due at the end of the construction project. For additional guidance on disclosing construction-permanent loans, see § <ref target="1026-17-c-6-ii" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)(6)(ii)</ref>, comments 17(c)(6)-2, -3, and -5, and appendix D to this part.</content>

        <content>The creditor is required to disclose that the credit is for a “home equity loan” if the creditor intends to extend credit for any purpose other than a purchase, refinancing, or construction. This disclosure applies whether the loan is secured by a first or subordinate lien.</content>

      <title>Additional features.</title>
      <content>When disclosing a loan product with at least one of the features described in § <ref target="1026-37-a-10-ii" reftype="internal">1026.37(a)(10)(ii)</ref>, § <ref target="1026-37-a-10-iii" reftype="internal">1026.37(a)(10)(iii)</ref> and (iv) require the disclosure of only the first applicable feature in the order of § <ref target="1026-37-a-10-ii" reftype="internal">1026.37(a)(10)(ii)</ref> and that it be preceded by the time period or the length of the introductory period and the frequency of the first adjustment period, as applicable, followed by a description of the loan product and its time period as provided for in § <ref target="1026-37-a-10-i" reftype="internal">1026.37(a)(10)(i)</ref>. For example:</content>
      <interpParagraph label="1026-37-a-13-Interp-2-i" marker="i.">
        <title>Negative amortization.</title>
        <content>Some loan products, such as “payment option” loans, permit the borrower to make payments that are insufficient to cover all of the interest accrued, and the unpaid interest is added to the principal balance. Where the loan product includes a loan feature that may cause the loan balance to increase, the disclosure required by § <ref target="1026-37-a-10-ii-A" reftype="internal">1026.37(a)(10)(ii)(A)</ref> is preceded by the time period that the borrower is permitted to make payments that result in negative amortization (e.g., “2 Year Negative Amortization”), followed by the loan product type. Thus, a fixed rate product with a step-payment feature for the first two years of the legal obligation that may negatively amortize is disclosed as “2 Year Negative Amortization, Fixed Rate.”</content>
      </interpParagraph>
      <interpParagraph label="1026-37-a-13-Interp-2-ii" marker="ii.">
        <title>Interest only.</title>
        <content>When disclosing an “Interest Only” feature, as defined in § <ref target="1026-18-s-7-iv" reftype="internal">1026.18(s)(7)(iv)</ref>, the applicable time period must precede the label “Interest Only.” Thus, a fixed rate loan with only interest due for the first five years of the loan term is disclosed as “5 Year Interest Only, Fixed Rate.” If the interest only feature fails to cover the total interest due, then, as required by § <ref target="1026-37-a-10-iii" reftype="internal">1026.37(a)(10)(iii)</ref>, the disclosure must reference the negative amortization feature and not the interest only feature (e.g., “5 Year Negative Amortization, Fixed Rate”). See comment app. D-7.ii for an explanation of the disclosure of the time period of an interest only feature for a construction loan or a construction-permanent loan.</content>
      </interpParagraph>
      <interpParagraph label="1026-37-a-13-Interp-2-iii" marker="iii.">
        <title>Step payment.</title>
        <content>When disclosing a step payment feature (which is sometimes referred to instead as a graduated payment), the period of time at the end of which the scheduled payments will change must precede the label “Step Payment” (e.g., “5 Year Step Payment”) followed by the name of the loan product. Thus, a fixed rate mortgage subject to a 5-year step payment plan is disclosed as a “5 Year Step Payment, Fixed Rate.”</content>
      </interpParagraph>
      <interpParagraph label="1026-37-a-13-Interp-2-iv" marker="iv.">
        <title>Ballon payment.</title>
        <content>If a loan product includes a “balloon payment,” as that term is defined in § <ref target="1026-37-b-5" reftype="internal">1026.37(b)(5)</ref>, the disclosure of the balloon payment feature, including the year the payment is due, precedes the disclosure of the loan product. Thus, if the loan product is a step rate with an introductory rate that lasts for three years and adjusts each year thereafter until the balloon payment is due in the seventh year of the loan term, the disclosure required is “Year 7 Balloon Payment, 3/1 Step Rate.” If the loan product includes more than one balloon payment, only the earliest year that a balloon payment is due shall be disclosed.</content>

The feature is not, however, required to be disclosed with any preceding time period.

      <content>On the Loan Estimate for simultaneous subordinate financing purchase transactions, the sale price disclosed under § <ref target="1026-37-a-7-i" reftype="internal">1026.37(a)(7)(i)</ref> is not used under § <ref target="1026-37-h-1" reftype="internal">1026.37(h)(1)</ref> for the calculating cash to close table calculations that include the sale price as a component of the calculation.

      <title>Calculation of total of payments.</title>
      <content>The total of payments is the total, expressed as a dollar amount, the consumer will have paid after making all payments of principal, interest, mortgage insurance, and loan costs, as scheduled, through the end of the loan term. The total of payments excludes charges that would otherwise be included as components of the total of payments if such charges are designated on the Closing Disclosure as paid by seller or paid by others. A seller or other party, such as the creditor, may agree to offset payments of principal, interest, mortgage insurance, or loan costs, whether in whole or in part, through a specific credit, for example through a specific seller or lender credit. Because these amounts are not paid by the consumer, they are excluded from the total of payments calculation. Non-specific credits, however, are generalized payments to the consumer that do not pay for a particular fee and therefore do not offset amounts for purposes of the total of payments calculation. For guidance on the amounts included in the total of payments calculation, see the “In 5 Years” disclosure under § <ref target="1026-37-l-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.37(l)(1)(i)</ref> and comment 37(l)(1)(i)-1.

If the permanent financing has a fixed rate that will not be adjusted when the construction phase converts to the permanent phase, that fixed rate is used for disclosure purposes. If the permanent financing has a rate that may adjust when the construction phase converts to the permanent phase, the permanent financing has an adjustable rate. If the legal obligation for a loan secured by the consumer's principal dwelling provides that the permanent financing interest rate may adjust when the construction financing converts to permanent financing, and such adjustment to the interest rate results in a corresponding adjustment to the payment, the creditor provides the disclosures pursuant to § <ref target="1026-20-c" reftype="internal">1026.20(c)</ref>, but not (d), if the interest rate for the permanent phase will be fixed after the conversion.</content>

        <content>A creditor must disclose a projected payments table for certain transactions secured by real property or a cooperative unit, pursuant to §§ <ref target="1026-37-c" reftype="internal">1026.37(c)</ref> and <ref target="1026-38-c" reftype="internal">1026.38(c)</ref>, instead of the general payment schedule required by § <ref target="1026-18-g" reftype="internal">1026.18(g)</ref> or the interest rate and payments summary table required by § <ref target="1026-18-s" reftype="internal">1026.18(s)</ref>. Accordingly, some home construction loans that are secured by real property or a cooperative unit are subject to §§ <ref target="1026-37-c" reftype="internal">1026.37(c)</ref> and <ref target="1026-38-c" reftype="internal">1026.38(c)</ref> and not § <ref target="1026-18-g" reftype="internal">1026.18(g)</ref>. See comment app. D-6 for a discussion of transactions that are subject to § <ref target="1026-18-s" reftype="internal">1026.18(s)</ref>. Under § <ref target="1026-17-c-6-ii" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)(6)(ii)</ref>, when a multiple-advance construction loan may be permanently financed by the same creditor, the construction phase and the permanent phase may be treated as either one transaction or more than one transaction. The following are illustrations of the application of appendix D to transactions subject to §§ <ref target="1026-37-c" reftype="internal">1026.37(c)</ref> and <ref target="1026-38-c" reftype="internal">1026.38(c)</ref>, under each of the § <ref target="1026-17-c-6-ii" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)(6)(ii)</ref> alternatives:</content>

          <content>If a creditor uses appendix D and elects pursuant to § <ref target="1026-17-c-6-ii" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)(6)(ii)</ref> to disclose the construction and permanent phases as separate transactions, the construction phase must be disclosed according to the rules in §§ <ref target="1026-37-c" reftype="internal">1026.37(c)</ref> and <ref target="1026-38-c" reftype="internal">1026.38(c)</ref>.

The provision in appendix D, part I.A.3, which allows the creditor to omit the number and amounts of any interest payments “in disclosing the payment schedule under § <ref target="1026-18-g" reftype="internal">1026.18(g)</ref>” does not apply because the transaction is governed by §§ <ref target="1026-37-c" reftype="internal">1026.37(c)</ref> and <ref target="1026-38-c" reftype="internal">1026.38(c)</ref> rather than § <ref target="1026-18-g" reftype="internal">1026.18(g)</ref>. If interest is payable only on the amount actually advanced for the time it is outstanding, the creditor determines the amount of the interest-only payment to be made during the construction phase using the assumptions in appendix D, part I.A.1. Also, because the construction phase is being disclosed as a separate transaction and its periodic payments do not repay the principal, the creditor must disclose the construction phase transaction as a product with a balloon payment feature, pursuant to §§ <ref target="1026-37-a-10-ii-D" reftype="internal">1026.37(a)(10)(ii)(D)</ref> and <ref target="1026-38-a-5-iii" reftype="internal">1026.38(a)(5)(iii)</ref>, unless the transaction has negative amortization, interest-only, or step payment features, consistent with the requirement at § <ref target="1026-37-a-10-iii" reftype="internal">1026.37(a)(10)(iii)</ref>. In addition, the creditor must provide the balloon payment disclosures pursuant to §§ <ref target="1026-37-b-5" reftype="internal">1026.37(b)(5)</ref>, <ref target="1026-37-b-7-ii" reftype="internal">1026.37(b)(7)(ii)</ref>, and <ref target="1026-38-b" reftype="internal">1026.38(b)</ref> and disclose the balloon payment in the projected payments table.</content>

          <content>If the creditor elects to disclose the construction and permanent phases as a single transaction, the repayment schedule must be disclosed pursuant to appendix D, part II.C.2. Under appendix D, part II.C.2, the projected payments table reflects the interest-only payments during the construction phase in a first column. The first column also reflects the amortizing payments, and mortgage insurance and escrow payments, if any, for the permanent phase if the term of the construction phase is not a full year. The following column(s) reflect the payments for the permanent phase. If interest is payable only on the amount actually advanced for the time it is outstanding, the creditor determines the amount of the interest-only payment to be made during the construction phase using the assumption in appendix D, part II.A.1.</content>

          <content>Consistent with comments 37(c)(2)(ii)-1 and 37(c)(2)(iii)-1, when the loan is disclosed as one transaction and only the terms of the legal obligation for the permanent phase require mortgage insurance or escrow, the way the creditor discloses the escrow and mortgage insurance depends on whether the first column of the projected payments table exclusively discloses the construction phase. If the first column of the projected payments table exclusively discloses the construction phase, the creditor discloses “0” in the first column of the projected payments table for mortgage insurance and a hyphen or dash in the first column of the projected payments table for escrow. If the first column discloses both the construction phase and the permanent phase payments, the amount of the mortgage insurance premium or escrow payment (if any) for the permanent phase is disclosed in the first column.</content>

        <content>Comment 4(a)-1.ii.A provides that inspection and handling fees, including draw fees, for the staged disbursement of construction loan proceeds are part of the finance charge. Comment 37(f)-3 states that such inspection and handling fees are loan costs associated with the transaction for purposes of § <ref target="1026-37-f" reftype="internal">1026.37(f)</ref> and, as such, must be disclosed accurately as part of the Loan Estimate. These fees must also be disclosed accurately as part of the Closing Disclosure. Comment 38(f)-2 refers to explanations under comments 37(f)-3 and 37(f)(6)-3 for making these disclosures. Comment 37(f)-3 explains that, if such fees are collected at or before consummation, they are disclosed in the loan costs table.
