                <title>$500 limit applies.</title>
                <content>The second tier of liability is $500. For example, the <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s card is stolen on Monday and the <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> learns of the theft that same day. The <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> reports the theft on Friday. The $500 limit applies because the <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> failed to notify the <ref target="1005-2-i" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> within two <ref target="1005-2-d" reftype="term">business days</ref> of learning of the theft (which would have been by midnight Wednesday). How much the <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> is actually liable for, however, depends on when the unauthorized transfers take place. In this example, assume a $100 unauthorized transfer was made on Tuesday and a $600 unauthorized transfer on Thursday. Because the <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> is liable for the amount of the loss that occurs within the first two <ref target="1005-2-d" reftype="term">business days</ref> (but no more than $50), plus the amount of the unauthorized transfers that occurs after the first two <ref target="1005-2-d" reftype="term">business days</ref> and before the <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> gives notice, the <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s total liability is $500 ($50 of the $100 transfer plus $450 of the $600 transfer, in this example). But if $600 was taken on Tuesday and $100 on Thursday, the <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s maximum liability would be $150 ($50 of the $600 plus $100).</content>

                <content>The standard of unlimited liability applies if unauthorized transfers appear on a periodic statement, and may apply in conjunction with the first two tiers of liability. If a periodic statement shows an unauthorized transfer made with a lost or stolen debit card, the <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> must notify the <ref target="1005-2-i" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> within 60 calendar days after the periodic statement was sent; otherwise, the <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> faces unlimited liability for all unauthorized transfers made after the 60-day period. The <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s liability for unauthorized transfers before the statement is sent, and up to 60 days following, is determined based on the first two tiers of liability: up to $50 if the <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> notifies the <ref target="1005-2-i" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> within two <ref target="1005-2-d" reftype="term">business days</ref> of learning of the loss or theft of the card and up to $500 if the <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> notifies the institution after two <ref target="1005-2-d" reftype="term">business days</ref> of learning of the loss or theft.</content>

However, if in addition to the $200, the <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">account</ref> is debited for a $400 unauthorized transfer on the 61st day and the <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> fails to notify the institution of the first unauthorized transfer until the 62nd day, the <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> may be liable for the full $400.</content>

Such cards, codes, or other devices generally are not subject to the requirements of this section because they are not issued to a <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> “in a specified amount” as required under the definitions of “<ref target="1005-20-a-1" reftype="term">gift certificate</ref>,” “<ref target="1005-20-a-2" reftype="term">store gift card</ref>,” or “<ref target="1005-20-a-3" reftype="term">general-use prepaid card</ref>.” However, if the card, code, or other device is issued in a specified or denominated amount that can be applied toward the purchase of a specific good or service, such as a certificate or card redeemable for a spa treatment up to $50, the card, code, or other device is subject to this section, unless one of the exceptions in § <ref target="1005-20-b" reftype="internal">1005.20(b)</ref> apply. See, e.g., § <ref target="1005-20-b-3" reftype="internal">1005.20(b)(3)</ref>. Similarly, if the card, code, or other device <ref target="1005-2-l" reftype="term">states</ref> a specific monetary value, such as “a $50 value,” the card, code, or other device is subject to this section, unless an exclusion in § <ref target="1005-20-b" reftype="internal">1005.20(b)</ref> applies.</content>

              <title>Issued primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.</title>
              <content>Section <ref target="1005-20" reftype="internal">1005.20</ref> only applies to cards, codes, or other devices that are sold or issued to a <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. A card, code, or other device initially purchased by a business is subject to this section if the card, code, or other device is purchased for redistribution or resale to <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumers</ref> primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. Moreover, the fact that a card, code, or other device may be primarily funded by a business, for example, in the case of certain rewards or incentive cards, does not mean the card, code, or other device is outside the scope of § <ref target="1005-20" reftype="internal">1005.20</ref>, if the card, code, or other device will be provided to a <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. But see § <ref target="1005-20-b-3" reftype="internal">1005.20(b)(3)</ref>. Whether a card, code, or other device is issued to a <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> primarily for personal, family, or household purposes will depend on the facts and circumstances. For example, if a program manager purchases <ref target="1005-20-a-2" reftype="term">store gift cards</ref> directly from an issuing merchant and sells those cards through the program manager's retail outlets, such gift cards are subject to the requirements of § <ref target="1005-20" reftype="internal">1005.20</ref> because the <ref target="1005-20-a-2" reftype="term">store gift cards</ref> are sold to <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumers</ref> primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. In contrast, a card, code, or other device generally would not be issued to <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumers</ref> primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, and therefore would fall outside the scope of § <ref target="1005-20" reftype="internal">1005.20</ref>, if the purchaser of the card, code, or device is contractually prohibited from reselling or redistributing the card, code, or device to <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumers</ref> primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, and reasonable policies and procedures are maintained to avoid such sale or distribution for such purposes. However, if an entity that has purchased cards, codes, or other devices for business purposes sells or distributes such cards, codes, or other devices to <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumers</ref> primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, that entity does not comply with § <ref target="1005-20" reftype="internal">1005.20</ref> if it has not otherwise met the substantive and disclosure requirements of the rule or unless an exclusion in § <ref target="1005-20-b" reftype="internal">1005.20(b)</ref> applies.</content>

Under these circumstances, while the card does not qualify for the exclusion for cards, codes, or other devices not marketed to the general public under § <ref target="1005-20-b-4" reftype="internal">1005.20(b)(4)</ref> because the card can also be obtained through retail channels, it is nevertheless exempt from the substantive requirements of § <ref target="1005-20" reftype="internal">1005.20</ref> because it is a <ref target="1005-20-a-4" reftype="term">loyalty, award, or promotional gift card</ref>. See, however, § <ref target="1005-20-a-4-iii" reftype="internal">1005.20(a)(4)(iii)</ref>, requiring certain disclosures for <ref target="1005-20-a-4" reftype="term">loyalty, award, or promotional gift cards</ref>. Similarly, a <ref target="1005-2-j" reftype="term">person</ref> may market a reloadable card to teenagers for occasional expenses that enables parents to monitor spending. Although the card does not qualify for the exclusion for cards, codes, or other devices not marketed to the general public under § <ref target="1005-20-b-4" reftype="internal">1005.20(b)(4)</ref>, it may nevertheless be exempt from the requirements of § <ref target="1005-20" reftype="internal">1005.20</ref> under § <ref target="1005-20-b-2" reftype="internal">1005.20(b)(2)</ref> if it is reloadable and not marketed or labeled as a gift card or <ref target="1005-20-a-1" reftype="term">gift certificate</ref>.</content>

                <title>Marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate.</title>
                <content>The term “marketed or labeled as a gift card or <ref target="1005-20-a-1" reftype="term">gift certificate</ref>” means directly or indirectly offering, advertising, or otherwise suggesting the potential use of a card, code or other device, as a gift for another <ref target="1005-2-j" reftype="term">person</ref>. Whether the exclusion applies generally does not depend on the type of entity that makes the promotional message. For example, a card may be marketed or labeled as a gift card or <ref target="1005-20-a-1" reftype="term">gift certificate</ref> if anyone (other than the purchaser of the card), including the issuer, the retailer, the program manager that may distribute the card, or the payment network on which a card is used, promotes the use of the card as a gift card or <ref target="1005-20-a-1" reftype="term">gift certificate</ref>. A card, code, or other device, including a general-purpose reloadable card, is marketed or labeled as a gift card or <ref target="1005-20-a-1" reftype="term">gift certificate</ref> even if it is only occasionally marketed as a gift card or <ref target="1005-20-a-1" reftype="term">gift certificate</ref>. For example, a network-branded general purpose reloadable card would be marketed or labeled as a gift card or <ref target="1005-20-a-1" reftype="term">gift certificate</ref> if the issuer principally advertises the card as a less costly alternative to a bank <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">account</ref> but promotes the card in a television, radio, newspaper, or Internet advertisement, or on signage as “the perfect gift” during the holiday season. However, the mere mention of the availability of gift cards or <ref target="1005-20-a-1" reftype="term">gift certificates</ref> in an advertisement or on a sign that also indicates the availability of other excluded prepaid cards does not by itself cause the excluded prepaid cards to be marketed as a gift card or a <ref target="1005-20-a-1" reftype="term">gift certificate</ref>. For example, the posting of a sign in a store that refers to the availability of gift cards does not by itself constitute the marketing of otherwise excluded prepaid cards that may also be sold in the store as gift cards or <ref target="1005-20-a-1" reftype="term">gift certificates</ref>, provided that a <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> acting reasonably under the circumstances would not be led to believe that the sign applies to all prepaid cards sold in the store.

                <content>To qualify for the exclusion in § <ref target="1005-20-b-5" reftype="internal">1005.20(b)(5)</ref>, the sole means of issuing the card, code, or other device must be in a paper form. Thus, the exclusion generally applies to certificates issued in paper form where solely the paper itself may be used to purchase goods or services. A card, code or other device is not issued solely in paper form simply because it may be reproduced or printed on paper. For example, a bar code, card or certificate number, or certificate or coupon electronically provided to a <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> and redeemable for goods and services is not issued in paper form, even if it may be reproduced or otherwise printed on paper by the <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref>. In this circumstance, although the <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> might hold a paper facsimile of the card, code, or other device, the exclusion does not apply because the information necessary to redeem the value was initially issued in electronic form. A paper certificate is within the exclusion regardless of whether it may be redeemed electronically. For example, a paper certificate or receipt that bears a bar code, code, or <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">account</ref> number falls within the exclusion in § <ref target="1005-20-b-5" reftype="internal">1005.20(b)(5)</ref> if the bar code, code, or <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">account</ref> number is not issued in any form other than on the paper. In addition, the exclusion in § <ref target="1005-20-b-5" reftype="internal">1005.20(b)(5)</ref> continues to apply in circumstances where an issuer replaces a <ref target="1005-20-a-1" reftype="term">gift certificate</ref> that was initially issued in paper form with a card or electronic code (for example, to replace a lost paper certificate).</content>

Disclosures need not be located on the front of the certificate or card, except where otherwise required, to be considered clear and conspicuous.

For example, disclosures on a card or computer screen are not likely to be conspicuous if obscured by a logo printed in the background. Similarly, disclosures on the back of a card that are printed on top of indentations from embossed type on the front of the card are not likely to be conspicuous if the indentations obstruct the readability of the disclosures. To the extent permitted, oral disclosures meet the standard when they are given at a volume and speed sufficient for a <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to hear and comprehend them.</content>

Section <ref target="1005-20-d-2" reftype="internal">1005.20(d)(2)</ref> requires the disclosure of dormancy, inactivity, and <ref target="1005-20-a-6" reftype="term">service fees</ref> on a certificate or card. Section <ref target="1005-20-c-3" reftype="internal">1005.20(c)(3)</ref> requires that vendor <ref target="1005-2-j" reftype="term">person</ref> that issues or sells such certificate or card disclose to a <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> any dormancy, inactivity, and <ref target="1005-20-a-6" reftype="term">service fees</ref> associated with the certificate or card before such certificate or card may be purchased. Depending on the context, a single disclosure that meets the clear and conspicuous requirements of both §§ <ref target="1005-20-d-2" reftype="internal">1005.20(d)(2)</ref> and <ref target="1005-20-c-3" reftype="internal">(c)(3)</ref> may be used to disclose a dormancy, inactivity, or <ref target="1005-20-a-6" reftype="term">service fee</ref>. For example, if the disclosures on a certificate or card, required by § <ref target="1005-20-d-2" reftype="internal">1005.20(d)(2)</ref>, are visible to the <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> without having to remove packaging or other materials sold with the certificate or card, for a purchase made in person, the disclosures also meet the requirements of § <ref target="1005-20-c-3" reftype="internal">1005.20(c)(3)</ref>. Otherwise, a dormancy, inactivity, or <ref target="1005-20-a-6" reftype="term">service fee</ref> may need to be disclosed multiple times to satisfy the requirements of §§ <ref target="1005-20-d-2" reftype="internal">1005.20(d)(2)</ref> and <ref target="1005-20-c-3" reftype="internal">(c)(3)</ref>. For example, if the disclosures on a certificate or card, required by § <ref target="1005-20-d-2" reftype="internal">1005.20(d)(2)</ref>, are obstructed by packaging sold with the certificate or card, for a purchase made in person, they also must be disclosed on the packaging sold with the certificate or card to meet the requirements of § <ref target="1005-20-c-3" reftype="internal">1005.20(c)(3)</ref>.</content>

For example, if a <ref target="1005-20-a-5" reftype="term">dormancy fee</ref> is imposed on January 1, following a year of inactivity, and a <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> makes a balance inquiry on January 15, a balance inquiry fee may not be imposed at that time because a <ref target="1005-20-a-5" reftype="term">dormancy fee</ref> was already imposed earlier that month and a balance inquiry fee is a type of <ref target="1005-20-a-6" reftype="term">service fee</ref>.

For example, assume a <ref target="1005-20-a-6" reftype="term">service fee</ref> is imposed on a <ref target="1005-20-a-3" reftype="term">general-use prepaid card</ref> on January 1, following a year of inactivity.

            <content><ref target="1005-2-i" reftype="term">Financial institutions</ref> may use clauses of their own design in conjunction with the Bureau's model clauses. The inapplicable words or portions of phrases in parentheses should be deleted. The catchlines are not part of the clauses and need not be used. <ref target="1005-2-i" reftype="term">Financial institutions</ref> may make alterations, substitutions, or additions in the clauses to reflect the services offered, such as technical changes (including the substitution of a trade name for the word “card,” deletion of inapplicable services, or substitution of lesser liability limits). Several of the model clauses include references to a telephone number and address. Where two or more of these clauses are used in a disclosure, the telephone number and address may be referenced and need not be repeated.</content>
